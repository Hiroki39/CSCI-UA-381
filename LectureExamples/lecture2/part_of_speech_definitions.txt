Different types of names – capitalized, refer to specific entity
'person name', 'organization name', 'place name', 'other name',

Two types of (common) nouns:  'singular noun' 'plural noun'
-- Can replace other nouns in sentences

4 types of verbs:
'past tense verb'  – usually ends in ‘ed’
'-ing verb'  – ends in  suffix ‘ing’
'-s verb' – present tense that ends in ‘s’
'simple verb' – present tense or infinitive (no final ‘s’)

'adjective' – pre-modify nouns, can replace other adjectives, can
occur after “be”; can follow “very”

'adverb' – ends in -ly or “if you don’t know what it is, then it is an adverb”

Note – these definitions are imperfect, but the test is how good the final output sounds

Test: Words that are the same part of speech can easily substitute for
each other, e.g., “red” and “smelly” are both adjectives: “the red
cheese”, “the smelly cheese”, “the cheese is smelly”, “the cheese is
red”
