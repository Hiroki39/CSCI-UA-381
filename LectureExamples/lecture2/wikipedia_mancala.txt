Mancala is one of the oldest known games to still be widely played
today. Mancala is a generic name for a family of two-player turn-based
strategy board games played with small stones, beans, or seeds and
rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing
surface. The objective is usually to capture all or some set of the
opponent's pieces. Versions of the game date back to the 7th century
and evidence suggests[according to whom?] the game existed in ancient
Egypt.
