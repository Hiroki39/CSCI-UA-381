<p>
<s snum=1>The expense and time involved are astronomical.</s>
<s snum=2>However, we sent a third vessel out, a much smaller and faster one than the first two.</s>
<s snum=3>We have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago; that is all I can tell you about them.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=4>``But the third ship came back several years ago and reported &&&''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=5>``That it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already inhabited by sentient beings''! said Hal, forgetting in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=6>Macneff stopped pacing to stare at Hal with his pale blue eyes.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>``How did you know''? he said sharply.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=8>``Forgive me, Sandalphon'', said Hal.</s>
<s snum=9>``But it was inevitable!</s>
<s snum=10>Did not the Forerunner predict in his Time and the World Line that such a planet would be found?</s>
<s snum=11>I believe it was on page 573''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>Macneff smiled and said, ``I am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=13>How could they not?</s>
<s snum=14>thought Hal.</s>
<s snum=15>Besides, they were not the only impressions.</s>
<s snum=16>I still bear scars on my back where Pornsen, my gapt, whipped me because I had not learned my lessons well enough.</s>
<s snum=17>He was a good impresser, that Pornsen.</s>
<s snum=18>Was?</s>
<s snum=19>Is!</s>
<s snum=20>As I grew older and was promoted, so was he, always where I was.</s>
<s snum=21>He was my gapt in the creche.</s>
<s snum=22>He was the dormitory gapt when I went to college and thought I was getting away from him.</s>
<s snum=23>He is now my block gapt.</s>
<s snum=24>He is the one responsible for my getting such low M. R.'s.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=25>Swiftly, came the revulsion, the protest.</s>
<s snum=26>No, not he, for I, and I alone, am responsible for whatever happens to me.</s>
<s snum=27>If I get a low M. R., I do so because I want it that way or my dark self does.</s>
<s snum=28>If I die, I die because I willed it so.</s>
<s snum=29>So, forgive me, Sigmen, for the contrary-to-reality thoughts!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>``Please pardon me again, Sandalphon'', said Hal.</s>
<s snum=31>``But did the expedition find any records of the Forerunner having been on this planet?</s>
<s snum=32>Perhaps, even, though this is too much to wish, find the Forerunner himself''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=33>``No'', said Macneff.</s>
<s snum=34>``Though that does not mean that there may not be such records there.</s>
<s snum=35>The expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to Earth.</s>
<s snum=36>I can't tell you now the distance in lightyears or what star this was, though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere.</s>
<s snum=37>If you volunteer, you will be told where you're going after the ship leaves.</s>
<s snum=38>And it leaves very soon''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=39>``You need a linguist''? said Hal.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=40>``The ship is huge'', said Macneff, ``but the number of military men and specialists we are taking limits the linguists to one.</s>
<s snum=41>We have considered several of your professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion.</s>
<s snum=42>Unfortunately &&&''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=43>Hal waited: Macneff paced some more, frowning.</s>
<s snum=44>Then, he said, ``Unfortunately, only one lamechian linguist exists, and he is too old for this expedition.</s>
<s snum=45>Therefore &&&''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=46>``A thousand pardons'', said Hal.</s>
<s snum=47>``But I have just thought of one thing.</s>
<s snum=48>I am married''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>``No problem at all'', said Macneff.</s>
<s snum=50>``There will be no women aboard the Gabriel.</s>
<s snum=51>And, if a man is married, he will automatically be given a divorce''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>Hal gasped, and he said, ``A divorce''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>Macneff raised his hands apologetically and said, ``You are horrified, of course.</s>
<s snum=54>But, from our reading of the Western Talmud, we Urielites believe that the Forerunner, knowing this situation would arise, made reference to and provision for divorce.</s>
<s snum=55>It's inevitable in this case, for the couple will be separated for, at the least, forty years.</s>
<s snum=56>Naturally, he couched the provision in obscure language.</s>
<s snum=57>In his great and glorious wisdom, he knew that our enemies the Israelites must not be able to read therein what we planned''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=58>``I volunteer'', said Hal.</s>
<s snum=59>``Tell me more, Sandalphon''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=60>Six months later, Hal Yarrow stood in the observation dome of the Gabriel and watched the ball of Earth dwindle above him.</s>
<s snum=61>It was night on this hemisphere, but the light blazed from the megalopolises of Australia, Japan, China, Southeast Asia, India, Siberia.</s>
<s snum=62>Hal, the linguist, saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken therein.</s>
<s snum=63>Australia, the Philippine Islands, Japan, and northern China were inhabited by those members of the Haijac Union that spoke American.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>Southern China, all of southeast Asia, southern India and Ceylon, these states of the Malay Federation spoke Bazaar.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=65>Siberia spoke Icelandic.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=66>His mind turned the globe swiftly for him, and he visualized Africa, which used Swahili south of the Sahara Sea.</s>
<s snum=67>All around the Mediterranean Sea, Asia Minor, northern India, and Tibet, Hebrew was the native tongue.</s>
<s snum=68>In southern Europe, between the Israeli Republics and the Icelandic-speaking peoples of northern Europe, was a thin but long stretch of territory called March.</s>
<s snum=69>This was no man's land, disputed by the Haijac Union and the Israeli Republic, a potential source of war for the last two hundred years.</s>
<s snum=70>Neither nation would give up their claim on it, yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second Apocalyptic War.</s>
<s snum=71>So, for all practical purposes, it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government (unrecognized outside its own borders).</s>
<s snum=72>Its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving tongues, plus a new one called Lingo, a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=73>Hal saw in his mind the rest of Earth: Iceland, Greenland, the Caribbean Islands, and the eastern half of South America.</s>
<s snum=74>Here the peoples spoke the tongue of Iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the Hawaiian-Americans who were busy resettling North America and the western half of South America after the Apocalyptic War.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>Then there was North America, where American was the native speech of all except the twenty descendants of French-Canadians living on the Hudson Bay Preserve.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>Hal knew that when that side of Earth rotated into the night zone, Sigmen City would blaze out into space.</s>
<s snum=77>And, somewhere in that enormous light, was his apartment.</s>
<s snum=78>But Mary would soon no longer be living there, for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to Tahiti.</s>
<s snum=79>She would weep in private, he was sure, for she loved him in her frigid way, though in public she would be dry-eyed.</s>
<s snum=80>Her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her, not because she had lost a beloved husband, but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically.</s>
<s snum=81>If Hal Yarrow had been killed in a crash, he must have wanted it that way.</s>
<s snum=82>There was no such thing as an ``accident''.</s>
<s snum=83>Somehow, all the other passengers (also supposed to have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the Gabriel) had simultaneously ``agreed'' to die.</s>
<s snum=84>And, therefore, being in disgrace, they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony.</s>
<s snum=85>No, the fish could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=86>Hal felt sorry for Mary; he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=87>Yet, he told himself, this was the best way.</s>
<s snum=88>He and Mary would no longer have to tear and rend at each other; their mutual torture would be over.</s>
<s snum=89>Mary was free to marry again, not knowing that the Sturch had secretly given her a divorce, thinking that death had dissolved her marriage.</s>
<s snum=90>She would have a year in which to make up her mind, to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt.</s>
<s snum=91>Perhaps, the psychological barriers that had prevented her from conceiving Hal's child would no longer be present.</s>
<s snum=92>Perhaps.</s>
<s snum=93>Hal doubted if this happy event would occur.</s>
<s snum=94>Mary was as frozen below the navel as he.</s>
<s snum=95>No matter who the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=96>The gapt.</s>
<s snum=97>Pornsen.</s>
<s snum=98>He would no longer have to see that fat face, hear that whining voice.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=99>``Hal Yarrow''! said the whining voice.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=100>And, slowly, feeling himself icy yet burning, Hal turned.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=101>There was the squat loose-jowled man, smiling lopsidedly up at him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=102>``My beloved ward, my perennial gadfly'', said the whining voice.</s>
<s snum=103>``I had no idea that you, too, would be on this glorious voyage.</s>
<s snum=104>But I might have known!</s>
<s snum=105>We seem to be bound by love; Sigmen himself must have foreseen it.</s>
<s snum=106>Love to you, my ward''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=107>``Sigmen love you, too, my guardian'', said Hal, choking.</s>
<s snum=108>``How wonderful to see your cherished self.</s>
<s snum=109>I had thought we would never again speak to each other''.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s snum=110>The Gabriel pointed towards her destination and, under one-gee acceleration, began to build up towards her ultimate velocity, 99.1 percent of the speed of light.</s>
<s snum=111>Meanwhile, all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship, went into the suspensor.</s>
<s snum=112>Here they would lie in suspended animation for many years.</s>
<s snum=113>Some time later, after a check had been made of all automatic equipment, the crew would join the others.</s>
<s snum=114>They would sleep while the Gabriel's drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured.</s>
<s snum=115>Upon reaching the desired speed, the automatic equipment would cut off the drive, and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journey's end.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=116>Many years later, the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration.</s>
<s snum=117>Again, a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied.</s>
<s snum=118>Then, after slowing the vessel considerably, the drive would adjust to a one-gee deceleration.</s>
<s snum=119>And the crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended animation.</s>
<s snum=120>These members would then unthaw the rest of the personnel.</s>
<s snum=121>And, in the half-year left before reaching their destination, the men would carry out whatever preparations were needed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=122>Hal Yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out.</s>
<s snum=123>He had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of Ozagen, Siddo.</s>
<s snum=124>And, from the first, he faced a difficult task.</s>
<s snum=125>The expedition that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words.</s>
<s snum=126>The description of the Siddo syntax was very restricted.</s>
<s snum=127>And, as Hal found out, obviously mistaken in many cases.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=128>This discovery caused Hal anxiety.</s>
<s snum=129>His duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the Gabriel how to speak Ozagen.</s>
<s snum=130>Yet, if he used all of the little means at his disposal, he would be instructing his students wrongly.</s>
<s snum=131>Moreover, even getting this across would be difficult.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=132>For one thing, the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed somewhat from Earthmen's; the sounds made by these organs were, therefore, dissimilar.</s>
<s snum=133>It was true that they could be approximated, but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=134>Another obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo.</s>
<s snum=135>Consider the tense system.</s>
<s snum=136>Instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future, Siddo used an entirely different word.</s>
<s snum=137>Thus, the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai, meaning to live, was, in the perfect tense, ksu'u'peli'afo, and, in the future, mai'teipa.</s>
<s snum=138>The same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses.</s>
<s snum=139>Plus the fact that Siddo not only had the normal (to Earthmen)three genders of masculine, feminine, and neuter, but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual.</s>
<s snum=140>Fortunately, gender was inflected, though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo.</s>
<s snum=141>The system of indicating gender varied according to tense.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=142>All the other parts of speech: nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs.</s>
