<s snum=98>There are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle: (1) Fence-line bunks- cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons; (2) Mechanized bunks- they sit within the feed lot, are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface; (3) Special bunks- as discussed here, they permit cattle to eat from all sides.</s>

</p>
<p>
<s snum=100>Several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk.</s>

<s snum=107>Filling these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=108>All-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year.</s>
<s snum=109>This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall.</s>
