<s snum=1>When several minutes had passed and Curt hadn't emerged from the livery stable, Brenner reentered the hotel and faced Summers across the counter.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=2>``I have a little job for you, Charlie.</s>
<s snum=3>I'm sure you won't mind doing me a small favor''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=4>Brenner's voice was oily, but Summers wasn't fooled.</s>
<s snum=5>He moistened his lips uneasily.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=6>``What is it you want me to do, Mr. Brenner''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>Brenner shrugged carelessly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=8>``It's very simple.</s>
<s snum=9>I just want you to take a message to Diane Molinari.</s>
<s snum=10>Tell her to come here to the hotel''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=11>Vastly relieved, Summers nodded and started toward the door.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>``One thing, Summers'', Brenner said.</s>
<s snum=13>``You're not to mention my name.</s>
<s snum=14>Tell her Curt Adams wants to see her''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=15>Summers pulled up short, and turned around.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=16>``I don't know, Mr. Brenner'', he said haltingly, beginning to get an inkling of Brenner's plans.</s>
<s snum=17>``It doesn't seem quite right, telling her a thing like that.</s>
<s snum=18>Couldn't I just''- His voice trailed off into silence.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>Brenner continued to smile, but his eyes were cold.</s>
<s snum=20>He turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=21>``You know, Summers'', he said thoughtfully.</s>
<s snum=22>``Eagle's Nest ought to have a fire company.</s>
<s snum=23>If someone were to drop a match in here, this place would go up like a haystack''.</s>
<s snum=24>He started toward the stairway, then turned to add, ``Tell her to come to Adams's room, that Adams is in trouble.</s>
<s snum=25>Tell her to hurry''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>``Yes sir''.</s>
<s snum=27>His face pale, Summers headed for the street.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=28>Curt's visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching.</s>
<s snum=29>He paused only long enough to ascertain that Jess's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right, then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>The fact that Jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that Diane's information had been wrong, but Curt didn't interpret it this way.</s>
<s snum=31>A man like Jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed.</s>
<s snum=32>Probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=33>From the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach Black's house without using the street.</s>
<s snum=34>Curt approached the place cautiously, and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>There was a light in Black's front room, but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior.</s>
<s snum=36>Curt circled the house and located a barn out back.</s>
<s snum=37>He could hear horses moving around inside, and nothing else.</s>
<s snum=38>There was no lock on the door, only an iron hook which he unfastened.</s>
<s snum=39>He opened the door and went in, pulling it shut behind him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=40>Again he stood in the darkness listening, but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor.</s>
<s snum=41>He moved ahead carefully, his left hand in front of him, and came to a wooden partition.</s>
<s snum=42>Horse smell was very strong, and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws.</s>
<s snum=43>He found a match in his pocket and lit it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=44>There were two horses in the barn, a sway-backed dun and Jess Crouch's buckskin.</s>
<s snum=45>Curt snuffed out the match.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=46>It was certain now that Jess was in the house, but also, presumably, was Stacey Black.</s>
<s snum=47>Curt wanted to get Jess alone, without interference from anyone, even as spineless a person as the store owner.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=48>He studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved.</s>
<s snum=49>Reaching across the side of the stall, he slapped the buckskin on the rump.</s>
<s snum=50>The startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=51>As Curt had hoped, the house door banged open.</s>
<s snum=52>He slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly, its hoofs rattling the side of the stall.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>Curt moved over beside the door and waited.</s>
<s snum=54>Presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard, and Jess's smothered curses.</s>
<s snum=55>The door swung open, and Jess said sourly, ``What the hell's the matter with you?'' </s>
<s snum=56>The horse continued to snort.</s>
<s snum=57>Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance in its owner's voice.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=58>Jess cursed again, and entered the barn.</s>
<s snum=59>A match flared, and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop.</s>
<s snum=60>As he crossed to the side of the stall, Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=61>``Before you try anything'', he said.</s>
<s snum=62>``Remember what happened to Gruller''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=63>Jess caught his breath in surprise.</s>
<s snum=64>He started to reach for his gun, but apparently thought better of it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=65>``That's the stuff'', Curt said.</s>
<s snum=66>``Just hold it that way''.</s>
<s snum=67>He reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt.</s>
<s snum=68>``You and I have a little talking to do, Jess.</s>
<s snum=69>You won't be needing this''.</s>
<s snum=70>He moved up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>``Damn you, Adams''- Jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock.</s>
<s snum=72>``We ain't got nothing to talk about.</s>
<s snum=73>If I don't come back in the house, Breed's going to''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=74>``Your trigger-happy brother isn't in the house.</s>
<s snum=75>About now he's probably having supper.</s>
<s snum=76>That long ride the four of you took must've given him a good appetite.</s>
<s snum=77>Now turn around so I can see your face''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>Jess turned.</s>
<s snum=79>There was raw fury in his eyes, and the veins of his neck were swollen.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=80>``You're about as dumb as they come, Adams.</s>
<s snum=81>I don't know what you're up to, but when Brenner''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>``You can forget about Brenner, too'', Curt said.</s>
<s snum=83>``It's Ben Arbuckle we're going to talk about''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>``Arbuckle''?</s>
<s snum=85>Jess stiffened.</s>
<s snum=86>``I don't know nothin' about him''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=87>``No?</s>
<s snum=88>I suppose you don't know anything about a piece of two-by-four, either; one with blood all over it, Arbuckle's blood''.</s>
<s snum=89>Curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun.</s>
<s snum=90>``So help me, Crouch, I'd like to kill you where you stand, but, before I do, I'm going to hear you admit killing him.</s>
<s snum=91>Now start talking.</s>
<s snum=92>Who told you to do it?</s>
<s snum=93>Was it Dutch Brenner''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=94>Curt was holding Jess's gun in his left hand.</s>
<s snum=95>He drew back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across Jess's face, but didn't finish the motion.</s>
<s snum=96>Pistol-whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like Jess, but Curt couldn't bring himself to do it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=97>Apparently sensing this, and realizing that it gave him an advantage, Jess became bold.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=98>``Having all the guns makes you a big man, don't it, Adams?</s>
<s snum=99>If we was both armed, you wouldn't talk so tough''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=100>``No''?</s>
<s snum=101>Curt reached out and dropped Jess's pistol back into the holster.</s>
<s snum=102>He retreated a step and holstered his own.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=103>``All right, Crouch; we're on even terms.</s>
<s snum=104>Now draw''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=105>Sweat bubbled out on Jess's swarthy face.</s>
<s snum=106>The fingers of his right hand twisted into a claw, but he didn't reach for the gun.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=107>Curt, angry enough to be a little reckless, raised his hands shoulder high.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=108>``Does this make it any easier, coward''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=109>``I ain't drawin' against you'', Jess said thickly.</s>
<s snum=110>``I heard how you outdrew Chico.</s>
<s snum=111>I ain't a gunslinger''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=112>``No.</s>
<s snum=113>You're the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind and hits him with a club.</s>
<s snum=114>I just wanted to hear you say so''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=115>Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides.</s>
<s snum=116>He had found Curt's weakness, or what to Jess was a weakness, and was smart enough to take advantage of it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>Somewhere in the distance, a woman screamed.</s>
<s snum=118>Curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention.</s>
<s snum=119>He had to make Jess talk, and he had to do it before Stacey Black got curious and came to investigate.</s>
<s snum=120>Once more he lifted Jess's gun from its holster, only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin.</s>
<s snum=121>He dropped his own beside it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=122>``We'll do it another way, then'', he said harshly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=123>Jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by Curt's fist.</s>
<s snum=124>With a roar of pain and fury Jess made his attack.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=125>Curt managed to duck beneath the man's flailing fist, and drove home a solid left to Jess's mid-section.</s>
<s snum=126>It was like hitting a sack of salt.</s>
<s snum=127>Pain shout up Curt's arm clear to the shoulder, but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit.</s>
<s snum=128>He slammed into the wall, bounced back, and caught Curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning.</s>
<s snum=129>An inch lower and it would have knocked him out.</s>
<s snum=130>As it was, his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move.</s>
<s snum=131>When his eyes began to focus, he saw Jess charging at him with a pitchfork.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=132>Curt twisted to one side, and the tines of the fork bit into the floor.</s>
<s snum=133>Jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose.</s>
<s snum=134>It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=135>The tines broke off under Jess's twisting, and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains out.</s>
<s snum=136>His aim was hurried; so the pitchfork whistled over Curt's head.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=137>By now Curt was seeing clearly again.</s>
<s snum=138>He stepped inside Jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly, putting everything he had behind them.</s>
<s snum=139>They made Jess double over.</s>
<s snum=140>When his head came down, Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=141>The building shook, setting the lantern to swaying, and the buckskin to pitching again.</s>
<s snum=142>Even Black's old crowbait began to snort, and from the house Black yelled, ``Jess!</s>
<s snum=143>What's going on out there''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=144>Jess didn't seem too sure himself.</s>
<s snum=145>He lurched drunkenly to his feet, lowered his head, and took one step away from the wall.</s>
<s snum=146>Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=147>Jess had had enough.</s>
<s snum=148>Blood gushed from his nose, and he backed off as rapidly as he could, stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curt's fists.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=149>Curt was in almost as bad shape, but he wouldn't quit.</s>
<s snum=150>He backed Jess into a corner, grabbed a handful of the man's shirtfront, and drew back his right fist.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=151>``Tell me about Arbuckle!</s>
<s snum=152>You killed him, didn't you''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=153>``It was Brenner's idea'', Jess mumbled, dabbing at his nose.</s>
<s snum=154>``He found out about you and Arbuckle talking.</s>
<s snum=155>He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=156>``You mean anyone who stood up for his rights'', Curt said.</s>
<s snum=157>He let go of the shirt, and Jess slumped to the floor.</s>
<s snum=158>Turning his back, Curt crossed to the stall, reached over to untie the buckskin's halter rope, and waved his hand in the animal's face.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=159>The buckskin bolted out of the stall.</s>
<s snum=160>Curt moved in and picked up his gun.</s>
<s snum=161>He shook loose straw out of the action, and placed the gun in his holster.</s>
<s snum=162>Leaving Jess's where it lay, he left the stall.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=163>``Get up, Crouch.</s>
<s snum=164>We're going someplace''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=165>Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=166>``Who's in there''?</s>
<s snum=167>Black called fearfully.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=168>Curt opened the door, grabbed Black by the shoulder, and pulled him into the barn.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=169>``You're staying right here for a while.</s>
<s snum=170>This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle.</s>
<s snum=171>I'm going to let him tell it to somebody else''.</s>
<s snum=172>He shoved Black toward the stall, and pointed his pistol at Jess.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=173>``Get out of here.</s>
<s snum=174>You're coming along peacefully, or I'll put a bullet in your leg''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=175>Jess stumbled through the door.</s>
<s snum=176>Curt followed, reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it.</s>
<s snum=177>Black would have little trouble getting out, but it might delay him a few minutes.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=178>``Where're you takin' me''?</s>
<s snum=179>Jess asked worriedly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=180>``We're going to Marshal Woods's house.</s>
<s snum=181>Maybe if the marshal hears this himself, it'll make a difference.</s>
<s snum=182>Somebody in this town must still have some backbone''.</s>
