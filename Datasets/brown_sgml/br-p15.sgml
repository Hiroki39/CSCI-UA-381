<s snum=1>``They make us conformists look good''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=2>``That's a peculiar way to think''.</s>
<s snum=3>It wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers, of course; she knew that.</s>
<s snum=4>It was Jim's ``little'' sister Myra, the unreliable, irresponsible, forever flyaway, Myra.</s>
<s snum=5>She's a year older than I am, Lucy told herself.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=6>``Come, come'', Jim said, jollying Lucy a little.</s>
<s snum=7>``I love you.</s>
<s snum=8>Susan ready''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=9>Lucy listened.</s>
<s snum=10>Obviously, Susan was not.</s>
<s snum=11>Upstairs, busy feet, showering like raindrops, pattered around her room.</s>
<s snum=12>Susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days, but even at seven she was a prudent soul; she always packed for a lifetime, just in case.</s>
<s snum=13>``Not yet.</s>
<s snum=14>Every doll in the house must be going with her''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=15>``She'd better step on it.</s>
<s snum=16>It's a long way to Websterville''.</s>
<s snum=17>Jim's fine young face was an expressive one, too; as he looked at her, it registered anxiety.</s>
<s snum=18>``You know'', he said.</s>
<s snum=19>``Myra wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy.</s>
<s snum=20>It'll be only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in Paris- but even so, she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=21>Lucy did not believe him; Myra appreciated nothing.</s>
<s snum=22>Jim had put the thanks in his sister's mouth.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=23>``Darling''- she said, and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend.</s>
<s snum=24>``She should have told me herself.</s>
<s snum=25>And will it be only a couple of weeks?</s>
<s snum=26>Remember what happened the last time''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=27>Leaving Cathy with them, Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly brief visit; but she had stayed all winter, and Cathy had stayed all winter too- with them.</s>
<s snum=28>Lucy suspected that Myra would never have come home if Gregg, Myra's husband, hadn't gone out to fetch her.</s>
<s snum=29>``That was an awfully long two weeks''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>For an otherwise silent moment, Jim's keys jingled nervously in his pocket.</s>
<s snum=31>``But she promised- This will be different'', he said at last.</s>
<s snum=32>``You've got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine government job over there- she'll get a home for herself and Cathy in no time.</s>
<s snum=33>You'll see, Myra's settling down''.</s>
<s snum=34>On the defensive, he added, ``I wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without Greg, to be a new widow, a young widow''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>``It depends on the widow''.</s>
<s snum=36>Lucy had an idea that Myra loved it.</s>
<s snum=37>And not for one moment did she believe that Myra had settled down.</s>
<s snum=38>It seemed to Lucy that all their married life, she and Jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life.</s>
<s snum=39>Remembering that succession of disasters, she now considered Cathy, an ominous child-cloud on her horizon.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=40>It was not that she disliked Cathy.</s>
<s snum=41>The youngster drew her, troubled her depths; whenever Lucy saw her, she tried, without noise or fuss, to give her the warmth she had never had from Myra.</s>
<s snum=42>But Cathy was Myra's responsibility, not hers.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=43>``I wouldn't even be surprised'', she said unhappily, ``if Myra tried to leave her with us forever''.</s>
<s snum=44>Myra loved big cities; thousands of miles away- in Paris, of all places- she might forget she had ever been a mother.</s>
<s snum=45>Lucy knew her too well to find it impossible.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=46>``That's a horrible thing to accuse her of''!</s>
<s snum=47>Jim was so indignant it was obvious that no matter what he said, he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-Cathy.</s>
<s snum=48>He went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up, fiercely, ``Susan!</s>
<s snum=49>Susan!</s>
<s snum=50>Get moving''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=51>A startled piping sound returned.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>``Don't yell at us'', Lucy said.</s>
<s snum=53>Was it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the moon-washed river?</s>
<s snum=54>Their arms around each other, they had been talking of the present and the future; their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm, as steeped in light, as the air around them.</s>
<s snum=55>Then, from within the still, sleeping house, the telephone had rung; Myra, with her news, was on the other end of the line.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=56>Jim turned back from the stairway and looked at her.</s>
<s snum=57>His dark brows, which had been lowered in anger, smoothed.</s>
<s snum=58>``Please'', he said.</s>
<s snum=59>``There isn't a chance of Myra's letting anything like that happen.</s>
<s snum=60>Let's stay friends''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=61>But they weren't just friends, Lucy thought; they were husband and wife, and Myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage.</s>
<s snum=62>The only thing that had ever come between them was that worthless, selfish sister of his.</s>
<s snum=63>Lucy was sick of it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>``Well, at last'', she said, because Susan was clattering down the stairs.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=65>Susan looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse; her arms were straining with a burden of dolls.</s>
<s snum=66>``I'm ready'', she announced.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=67>``Do you need that big bundle''?</s>
<s snum=68>Jim said.</s>
<s snum=69>His voice had sharp edges, as though he knew very well Lucy and he were not friends at the moment.</s>
<s snum=70>``All that junk''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>Susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed an instant grief; to her, each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=72>``Now, now'', Lucy said, approaching Susan with a handkerchief, mopping skillfully.</s>
<s snum=73>``Your father didn't mean it, Susan''.</s>
<s snum=74>She gave Jim a quick, shape-up look of warning.</s>
<s snum=75>``He'll take every one of them''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>Jim groaned, but he lifted Susan's suitcase and said, in a gentler tone, ``Sure- the entire thousand.</s>
<s snum=77>And when you get back from Grandma's, Cathy will be here to play with you.</s>
<s snum=78>Nice''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=79>``No'', Susan said, grappling with her outsized armload of dolls with a Scrooge-like effect.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=80>And at this point, Lucy thought, there should be a lecture on little cousins' sharing dolls- but she could sympathize with Susan; there ought to be a limit to sharing, too.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=81>That was one more reason she didn't look forward to Cathy's visit, short or long; the last one had been a Lilliputian war.</s>
<s snum=82>She suspected that Cathy had been competing with Susan for attention that she had never had.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=83>``Well'', Jim said, out of the silence, ``let's get going, dolls and all''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>When the car, with Susan's hands waving wildly from the rear window, disappeared down the driveway, Lucy stood looking after its pale dust.</s>
<s snum=85>The day was brilliant around her- flower-scented, crisp with breeze- yet her inner turmoil darkened it.</s>
<s snum=86>She had let Jim go with a chilly good-by, a chillier kiss.</s>
<s snum=87>She was sorry, and angry at herself, because never in their life together had she done that.</s>
<s snum=88>She turned and began to walk toward the house.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=89>At the feeding station, the raffish group of cowbirds again bobbed and gobbled over the ground, but now, gorgeous among them, was a beautiful red cardinal, radiant in its feathered vestments.</s>
<s snum=90>The handsome bird was solitary; its mate must be at home, silently guarding their nest.</s>
<s snum=91>She had better stay there, Lucy thought; the sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=92>Well, Lucy?</s>
<s snum=93>she said to herself, abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds.</s>
<s snum=94>She had a day of things to do; among them, she had to prepare the guest room.</s>
<s snum=95>How long would it be occupied?</s>
<s snum=96>she wondered, with a baffled feeling of helplessness.</s>
<s snum=97>As long as the unscrupulous Myra chose?</s>
<s snum=98>For a moment, her mind returned again to the strange, flying world of birds, and she said to herself.</s>
<s snum=99>It isn't only birds that dump their children in other people's nests.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=100>In the sunshine of late afternoon, Lucy stood looking at the ready guest room.</s>
<s snum=101>There were new yellow curtains, bright as a child's life ought to be, a new bedspread, lively with hopping rabbits, and hanging from the ceiling was an airy Mother Goose Mobile, spinning slowly in the breeze.</s>
<s snum=102>A row of little hangers waited for a child's clothes in the neatly empty closet; since Myra had always put most of Greg's money on her own back, Lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed.</s>
<s snum=103>The closet was faintly fragrant with lavender, and as Lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind, like a lavender ghost: Greg's house, on the day he was buried, and the child, pale, silent, baffled, watching the funeral guests with panicky eyes.</s>
<s snum=104>Many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=105>Out in the hall, the upstairs phone shrilled, and the small ghost vanished.</s>
<s snum=106>When she picked up the receiver, her mother's cheerful voice was there.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=107>``Websterville Junction calling'', she said.</s>
<s snum=108>``I just thought I'd let you know.</s>
<s snum=109>Myra dropped Cathy this morning, and Jim picked Cathy up and left Susan a few hours ago.</s>
<s snum=110>I'd have phoned sooner but I've been busy''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=111>``I can imagine''!</s>
<s snum=112>Susan was an active character; for Mother to be able to call, Susan must be napping now, surrounded by her multitude of dolls.</s>
<s snum=113>Lucy drew out the chair and sat down; she relaxed a little, and some of the tension went out of her.</s>
<s snum=114>You could think yourself as grown up as Methuselah, yet the maternal voice still kept its comforting magic.</s>
<s snum=115>``How was Cathy''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=116>``Subdued.</s>
<s snum=117>But Myra was the merriest widow I ever saw''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=118>On her way to the airport, on her way to Paris- you bet, Lucy said to herself.</s>
<s snum=119>``I've been fixing up the guest room for Cathy''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=120>There was a momentary pause, and then her mother said, ``How long is she supposed to stay''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=121>``Just for a couple of weeks, till Myra finds a place for them''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=122>``Well''- This time there was a long silence, while the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=123>Puzzled, Lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper; her mother was forthright; she was not usually given to mysterious silences.</s>
<s snum=124>Was she thinking along the same lines Lucy was- that it was quite possible Cathy might be left with her for good?</s>
<s snum=125>``You mean once Myra gets to Paris''?</s>
<s snum=126>Once the soft, pretty moth found the bright light she had always wanted?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=127>Suddenly, seekingly, Lucy asked, ``Mother, do you know something I don't know''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=128>Again there was that curious pause, and then her mother said, ``I guess I do.</s>
<s snum=129>Just before Myra left- She was saying good-by to Cathy, and she didn't realize I was near''.</s>
<s snum=130>She hesitated, as though hunting over words and ways of putting them.</s>
<s snum=131>``Cathy was in tears, of course, and I heard Myra say, 'Now be good, and at Christmastime I'll send you a wonderful present from Paris'''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=132>Shocked speechless, Lucy sat there.</s>
<s snum=133>Then she jumped to her feet, the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake.</s>
<s snum=134>``Christmastime!''</s>
<s snum=135> Then it was no bogey she had dreamed up; it was only too true.</s>
<s snum=136>Myra had no intention whatever of sending for Cathy in two weeks.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=137>For a moment, anger darkened the hallway about her, and when she found her voice, anger thickened it.</s>
<s snum=138>``That does it''! she said.</s>
<s snum=139>``I'll keep Cathy for two weeks.</s>
<s snum=140>Then, if Myra does nothing about fetching her, I'll pack her right back to her mother- if I have to take her myself''!</s>
<s snum=141>Her hand tightened on the receiver.</s>
<s snum=142>``And that's what I'm going to tell Jim''.</s>
<s snum=143>For Lucy, the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=144>As she hung up, she saw through the hall's open window the purple-black flying of the cowbirds' wings, and heard their grotesque singing.</s>
<s snum=145>Cowbird Myra!</s>
<s snum=146>She's not going to get away with it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=147>Cathy is tired, Lucy thought, watching them come slowly up the path.</s>
<s snum=148>The child's thin legs were plodding.</s>
<s snum=149>She trudged along slowly, both hands clutching a tired teddy bear.</s>
<s snum=150>She was at the moment just a small, walking package, being delivered to her aunt's and uncle's house.</s>
<s snum=151>Unlike Susan, she was traveling light; the worn teddy bear, a tiny suitcase that Jim carried, and the clothes she wore, were all she had.</s>
<s snum=152>Lucy glancing at the miniature case, knew there would not be enough in it for the shortest of stays; they would have to buy things for her.</s>
<s snum=153>She opened the door.</s>
