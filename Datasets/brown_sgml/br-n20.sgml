<s snum=1>They were west of the Sabine, but only God knew where.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=2>For three days, their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea.</s>
<s snum=3>Molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson; suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping; dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs.</s>
<s snum=4>And the valley stretched endlessly out ahead, scorched and baked and writhing in its heat, until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=5>Ben Prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen.</s>
<s snum=6>``Hoa-whup''! he commanded from his raw throat, and felt the pain of movement in his cracked, black burned lips.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face.</s>
<s snum=8>He spat.</s>
<s snum=9>The dust-thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton.</s>
<s snum=10>He moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing, grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played-out limbs.</s>
<s snum=11>The burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes in salt-edged patches.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>He cleared his throat and wet his lips.</s>
<s snum=13>As cheerfully as possible, he said, ``Well, I guess we could all do with a little drink''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=14>He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel.</s>
<s snum=15>They could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation.</s>
<s snum=16>The water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste.</s>
<s snum=17>But it was water.</s>
<s snum=18>Thank the Lord, they still had water!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>He cleansed his mouth with a small quantity.</s>
<s snum=20>He took a long but carefully controlled draught.</s>
<s snum=21>He replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck.</s>
<s snum=22>She took it grudgingly, her dark eyes baleful as they met his.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=23>She drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face.</s>
<s snum=24>She set the dipper on the edge of the deck, leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=25>``What happens when there's no more water''? she asked smolderingly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>She was like charcoal, he thought- dark, opaque, explosive.</s>
<s snum=27>Her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal.</s>
<s snum=28>Her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up.</s>
<s snum=29>And all the time, she had the heat of hatred in her, like charcoal that is burning on its under side, but not visibly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>A ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws, but he kept control upon his voice.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=31>``There must be some water under there''.</s>
<s snum=32>He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river.</s>
<s snum=33>``We can get it if we dig'', he said patiently.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=34>``And add fever to our troubles''? she scoffed.</s>
<s snum=35>``Or do you want to see if I can stand fever, too''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=36>``We can boil it'', he said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=37>Her chin sharpened.</s>
<s snum=38>``We're lost and burning up already'', she bit out tensely.</s>
<s snum=39>``The tires are rattling on the wheels now.</s>
<s snum=40>They'll roll off in another day.</s>
<s snum=41>There was no valley like this on your map.</s>
<s snum=42>You don't even know where we're headed''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=43>``Hettie'', he said as gently as he could, ``we're still headed west.</s>
<s snum=44>Somewhere, we'll hit a trail''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=45>``Somewhere!'' she repeated.</s>
<s snum=46>``Maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=47>His wide mouth compressed.</s>
<s snum=48>In a way, he couldn't blame her.</s>
<s snum=49>He had picked out this pathless trail, instead of the common one, in a moment of romantic fancy, to give them privacy on their honeymoon.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=50>It had been a mistake, but anything would have been a mistake, as it turned out.</s>
<s snum=51>It wasn't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her.</s>
<s snum=52>She had hated the whole idea before they started.</s>
<s snum=53>Actually, she had hated him before she ever saw him.</s>
<s snum=54>It had been five days too late before he learned that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum, administered by her mother.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=55>The bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound.</s>
<s snum=56>She had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder.</s>
<s snum=57>He had left her inviolate, thinking familiarity would gentle her in time.</s>
<s snum=58>But each mile westward, she had hated him the deeper.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=59>He stared at the dipper, turning it over and over in his wide, calloused hands.</s>
<s snum=60>``I suppose'', he muttered, ``I can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks, once we find a settlement''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=61>``Don't try to be noble''!</s>
<s snum=62>Her laugh was hard.</s>
<s snum=63>``They wouldn't have sold me in the first place if there'd been food enough to go around''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>He winced.</s>
<s snum=65>``Hettie, they didn't sell you'', he said miserably.</s>
<s snum=66>``They knew I was a good sharecrop farmer back in Carolina, but out West was a chance to build a real farm of our own.</s>
<s snum=67>They thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them.</s>
<s snum=68>Without money or property, what would you have had at Baton Rouge''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=69>``I might have starved, but at least I wouldn't be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=70>He darkened under his heavy burn.</s>
<s snum=71>His blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=72>To his puzzlement, there suddenly was no haze.</s>
<s snum=73>The valley lay clear, and open to the eye, right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt, scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=74>Then he noticed the clouds racing upon them- heavy, ominous, leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills.</s>
<s snum=75>He had never seen clouds like them before, but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in Carolina.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>He hollered hoarsely, ``Hang on''! and goaded the oxen as he yelled.</s>
<s snum=77>He wanted to turn them, putting the wagon against the storm.</s>
<s snum=78>Too late, he realized that in turning, he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground, instead of atop a grade or ridge.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=79>He swung up over the wheel.</s>
<s snum=80>``You had better get inside'', he warned her.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=81>But she sat on in stubborn silence.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>The clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel.</s>
<s snum=83>Frozen, they stared at it whirling down the valley, gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones.</s>
<s snum=84>The six-ton Conestoga began to whip and shake.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=85>Their world turned black.</s>
<s snum=86>It was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence.</s>
<s snum=87>The heavens opened, pelting them with hail the size of walnuts.</s>
<s snum=88>And then came the water- not rain, but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket.</s>
<s snum=89>Walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods.</s>
<s snum=90>Through the splash of the rising waters, they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon, gnashing big chunks out of the banks.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=91>The jetting, frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff.</s>
<s snum=92>The dangerous current upon the prairie ceased, but the water stood and kept on rising.</s>
<s snum=93>They cringed under sodden covers, listening to the waves slop against the bottom.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=94>The cloudburst cut off abruptly.</s>
<s snum=95>They were engulfed by the weird silence, broken only by the low, angry murmur of the river.</s>
<s snum=96>Then the darkness thinned, and there was light again, and then bright sunlight.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=97>Beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill, they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills.</s>
<s snum=98>The water level was higher than their hubs.</s>
<s snum=99>Only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=100>There was no real sign of the river now, just a roiling, oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere.</s>
<s snum=101>Clumps of brush rode down the ribbon.</s>
<s snum=102>Now and then, the glistening side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=103>The girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine, hugging her shoulders and still trembling.</s>
<s snum=104>Her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for Ben.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=105>Out of compulsion to say something cheery, Ben Prime blurted, ``Well, we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit.</s>
<s snum=106>At least, the wheels dug in.</s>
<s snum=107>The soaking will put life back in the wagon, too''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=108>His wife didn't give a sign she'd heard.</s>
<s snum=109>She was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current.</s>
<s snum=110>Somebody was riding the tree.</s>
<s snum=111>It raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair, sitting astride an upright branch.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=112>She did not call out.</s>
<s snum=113>But as the tree passed, she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell.</s>
<s snum=114>They watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend.</s>
<s snum=115>It speared up into the air, then sinking back, the up-jutting branch turned slowly.</s>
<s snum=116>The pale blob of the woman disappeared.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>``There's the one who's lucky''! the girl murmured harshly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=118>Ben's eyes strained with the bitter hurt, his homely face slashed with gray and crimson.</s>
<s snum=119>Then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts, needing their comfort more than they needed his.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=120>It was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon, half-swimming his way, for he was not a tall man.</s>
<s snum=121>He let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=122>He sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward.</s>
<s snum=123>They were already swollen to bursting.</s>
<s snum=124>Of all their worldly belongings, next to the oxen and his gun, the seed grain had been the most treasured.</s>
<s snum=125>It was spoiled now for seed, and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it.</s>
<s snum=126>The oxen might as well enjoy it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=127>He examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished.</s>
<s snum=128>The waters lay muddy but placid, without a ripple of movement against the wheels; there was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=129>He doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate, dry hills that rimmed the valley.</s>
<s snum=130>A terrible, numbing sense of futility swept over him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=131>He gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat.</s>
<s snum=132>Then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen.</s>
<s snum=133>The spokes were tight again, the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=134>Hope surged within him.</s>
<s snum=135>He swung toward the front to give the news to Hettie, then stopped, barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate.</s>
<s snum=136>Still, he felt better.</s>
<s snum=137>A tight wagon meant so much.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=138>He got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee.</s>
<s snum=139>He poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour, salvaging the chunky, watery messes for biscuits of a sort.</s>
<s snum=140>Their jams and jellies had not suffered.</s>
<s snum=141>He found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save.</s>
<s snum=142>Now he broke them open, hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing Hettie.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=143>His long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating java, but the fire was low, and he wanted to waste no time.</s>
<s snum=144>He furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins, leaving the ribs and wagon open.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=145>He looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk, holding her meager treasures.</s>
<s snum=146>He said hesitantly, ``Hettie, I don't figure your things got wet too much.</s>
<s snum=147>That's a good trunk.</s>
<s snum=148>If you want to get them aired''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=149>She said without turning her head, ``After that rain beating in atop the dust, there isn't a thing that won't be streaked''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=150>He drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs.</s>
