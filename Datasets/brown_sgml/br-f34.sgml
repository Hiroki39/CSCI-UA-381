</p>
<p>
<s snum=25>Oils, or liquid fats, from the seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood and metal.</s>

<s snum=76>Still another group of seeds (sometimes tiny, dry, seed-bearing fruits) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods, although the nutrients they supply are quite negligible.</s>
<s snum=77>The common spices, flavorings, and condiments make up this group.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>Each year millions of pounds of anise, caraway, mustard, celery, and coriander and the oils extracted from them are imported.</s>
