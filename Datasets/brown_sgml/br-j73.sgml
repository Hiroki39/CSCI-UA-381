<hl>ORGANIZATION:</hl>
<p>
<s snum=1>In this publication measurements of interfacial angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances.</s>
<s snum=2>T. V. Barker, who developed the classification-angle system, was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he died in 1931.</s>
<s snum=3>The compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University Museum at Oxford.</s>
<s snum=4>Since 1948 the working headquarters has been the Department of Geology and Mineralogy.</s>
<s snum=5>Numerous cooperating individuals in Great Britain, Holland, the United States, and Belgium have contributed editorially or by making calculations.</s>
<s snum=6>Great interest and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee.</s>
<s snum=7>Financial and material help have come from academic, governmental, and industrial organizations in England and Holland.</s>
<s snum=8>Editors for Volumes /1, and /2, were M. W. Porter and the late R. C. Spiller, both of Oxford University.</s>
<s snum=9>A third volume remains to be published.</s>
</p>
<hl>SUBSTANCES:</hl>
<p>
<s snum=10>Volume /1, deals with 2991 compounds belonging to the tetragonal, hexagonal and trigonal, and orthorhombic systems; and Volume /2,, with about 3500 monoclinic substances.</s>
<s snum=11>Volume /3,, in preparation, will treat the anorthic compounds described in Groth's Chemische Krystallographie.</s>
</p>
<hl>PROPERTIES:</hl>
<p>
<s snum=12>The Barker system is based on the use of the smallest number of interfacial angles necessary for indexing purposes.</s>

<p>
<s snum=14>The index is essentially a new treatment of previously compiled morphological data.</s>

</p>
<hl>CRITICALITY:</hl>
<p>
<s snum=16>Every calculation has been made independently by two workers and checked by one of the editors.</s>
</p>
<hl>USE OF NOMENCLATURE, SYMBOLS, UNITS, PHYSICAL CONSTANTS:</hl>
<p>
<s snum=17>Accepted crystallographic symbolism has been used; other symbols related to the index necessarily have been introduced.</s>
</p>

<hl>/2,-2.CRYSTAL DATA</hl>
<hl>ORGANIZATION:</hl>
<p>
<s snum=30>The present edition of Crystal Data was written by J.D.H. Donnay, the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md. (Part /2,) and Werner Nowacki, University of Berne, Switzerland (Part /1,) with the collaboration of Gabrielle Donnay, U. S. Geological Survey, Washington, D. C..</s>
<s snum=31>Many collaborators in the United States and Switzerland helped in collecting and assembling data, in making calculations, and in editing.</s>
<s snum=32>Support came from academic and industrial groups in these two countries.</s>
<s snum=33>The Geological Society of America gave a grant-in-aid to complete the work and bore the expenses of publication.</s>
<s snum=34>Preparation of a second edition is in progress under the sponsorship of the Crystal Data Committee of the American Crystallographic Association.</s>

</p>
<hl>SUBSTANCES:</hl>
<p>
<s snum=38>Elements, alloys, inorganic and organic compounds.</s>
<s snum=39>(Metal data will not be included in the second edition, since these have been collected independently by W.B. Pearson, National Research Council, Ottawa, and published as A Handbook Of Lattice Spacings And Structures Of Metals And Alloys by Pergamon Press.)</s>
</p>
<hl>PROPERTIES:</hl>
<p>
<s snum=40>Crystallographic data resulting mainly from ~X-ray and electron diffraction measurements are presented.</s>

<hl>CRITICALITY:</hl>
<p>
<s snum=45>The vast number of compounds to be covered, the limited resources to do the job, and the immediate need for this type of compilation precluded a thorough evaluation of all available data in the present edition.</s>

<s snum=48>The second edition should have greater uniformity.</s>
</p>
<hl>CURRENCY:</hl>
<p>
<s snum=49>A second edition is in preparation, and there are long range plans for a third.</s>
