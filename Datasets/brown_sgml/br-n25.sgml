<s snum=1>Early that day Matsuo saw a marine.</s>
<s snum=2>The enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot, then fled without knowing the result, ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery.</s>
<s snum=3>As his feet slowed, he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand.</s>
<s snum=4>He crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=5>In the leafiest part of the tree, straddling a broad horizontal limb, he could see over the meadow.</s>
<s snum=6>For a while he was content to let events develop in their good time.</s>
<s snum=7>He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column, and while his shot had probably bred indecision, they would soon come hunting.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=8>His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure.</s>
<s snum=9>Yesterday; today; tomorrow:</s>
<s snum=10>no surrender.</s>
<s snum=11>His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace- only a faint chill of doubt.</s>
<s snum=12>He murmured to himself, with firmness: ``No surrender''.</s>
<s snum=13>It was best to die fighting the marines.</s>
<s snum=14>His superiors had also preached this, saying it was the way for eternal honor.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=15>What if the marines never came?</s>
<s snum=16>His comrades were all dead.</s>
<s snum=17>He had no rice.</s>
<s snum=18>Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>Whichever the way, he would rot in this vast choking green, his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes.</s>
<s snum=20>He sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk.</s>
<s snum=21>His fingers touched the bone handle of a knife.</s>
<s snum=22>The knife, an ammunition pouch, and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt.</s>
<s snum=23>Besides the belt he wore a loin cloth.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=24>As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer, he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing.</s>
<s snum=25>Gloom receded.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>The marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed, as though debating whether to brave the sunlight.</s>
<s snum=27>His fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=28>``Come out, come out in the meadow'', Matsuo said under his breath.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=29>The man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face.</s>
<s snum=30>A signal?</s>
<s snum=31>Matsuo lifted his rifle, easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=32>Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills.</s>
<s snum=33>They had fought from caves, and the marines resorted to burning them out.</s>
<s snum=34>Even now, like a ringing in his ears, he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows.</s>
<s snum=35>A wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached Nagamo, his friend, and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance, then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet, his uniform blazing.</s>
<s snum=36>The marines let him advance.</s>
<s snum=37>When he sank on his knees, they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=38>Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses, both the burned and the unburned, the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun.</s>
<s snum=39>The callous marines had laughed at each other's retching, while stacking bodies.</s>
<s snum=40>Matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea.</s>
<s snum=41>At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle, reeking of death.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=42>Apprehensively he peered to the left, to the right into the leafy, vine-crisscrossed maze.</s>
<s snum=43>He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow, with the one left to distract him.</s>
<s snum=44>He strained his hearing.</s>
<s snum=45>Cautious feet stepping on leafmold; faint creaking of belts and slings; whispers: he heard none of these.</s>
<s snum=46>Only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird.</s>
<s snum=47>Because he couldn't hear them, he was more convinced they were there.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=48>A spectacle occurred across the meadow: the lone marine took a seat on the ground; leaning sidewise on a tree trunk, he embraced it.</s>
<s snum=49>Humiliation made Matsuo tremble.</s>
<s snum=50>While his comrades cocked the trap, that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver.</s>
<s snum=51>Taking aim at the man's face, Matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge, and then he changed his mind.</s>
<s snum=52>He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear, and so he aimed above the head.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound.</s>
<s snum=54>Hush followed.</s>
<s snum=55>Like a mischievous boy expecting punishment, Matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle.</s>
<s snum=56>How stupid to give his position away.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=57>The jungle did not retort.</s>
<s snum=58>The sitter remained seated hugging the tree.</s>
<s snum=59>Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy, and insects hummed and birds occasionally called.</s>
<s snum=60>Matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness, concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=61>Five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight, immediately throwing his hands over his eyes.</s>
<s snum=62>He went into a whirling dance, a sort of blind chasing of the tail.</s>
<s snum=63>It ended when he tumbled; but jumping right up, he staggered in no particular direction.</s>
<s snum=64>He wore no head cover of any kind and, more odd, had no visible weapon.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=65>With a sudden decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo's direction, crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop.</s>
<s snum=66>When he got closer to the tree, Matsuo noted the wild look on his face.</s>
<s snum=67>The pockets of his jacket bulged.</s>
<s snum=68>Hand grenades.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=69>the bobbing head was a poor target, so Matsuo shot him in the upper trunk.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=70>The marine spun, clapping a hand high on his chest, and dived forward.</s>
<s snum=71>In the hush that followed the echoes, Matsuo was tense.</s>
<s snum=72>They could come on him now without difficulty.</s>
<s snum=73>Gradually he reached a conclusion.</s>
<s snum=74>The marine was alone, for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage.</s>
<s snum=76>The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away, one arm extended.</s>
<s snum=77>Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out.</s>
<s snum=78>Reflex?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=79>Rifle leveled on the man, he made a rush.</s>
<s snum=80>Heat, in the sunlight, pressed in like an invisible crowd.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=81>He squatted by the head, gently placing the rifle on the ground.</s>
<s snum=82>With a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair, and, twisting, pulled the marine over on his back.</s>
<s snum=83>He was bearded.</s>
<s snum=84>The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone; around the hole, blood glistened in a little patch.</s>
<s snum=85>Maintaining his clutch on the hair, Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets.</s>
<s snum=86>In one: a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter, both sticky from the man's bleeding.</s>
<s snum=87>In the other: a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief.</s>
<s snum=88>One by one he tossed the objects aside.</s>
<s snum=89>He didn't smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter; he had no use any longer for exact time, even had the watch been running.</s>
<s snum=90>Then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=91>Too bad the marine had no water.</s>
<s snum=92>From its holder he took his own canteen.</s>
<s snum=93>The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure.</s>
<s snum=94>The marine's eyes opened, squeezed shut, then opened squinted in the glare.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=95>So, alive.</s>
<s snum=96>Matsuo put the bottle to his own lips.</s>
<s snum=97>The marine reached up a hand.</s>
<s snum=98>Matsuo shook his head.</s>
<s snum=99>``None for you''.</s>
<s snum=100>The marine blinked, soon dropping his hand.</s>
<s snum=101>Not only had he no canteen, but he lacked even the belt to hang one on.</s>
<s snum=102>``You came well equipped to die''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=103>Some odor made him lean over the man.</s>
<s snum=104>He sniffed and recognized it.</s>
<s snum=105>Sake.</s>
<s snum=106>So that had been his difficulty.</s>
<s snum=107>Drunk on sake, he must have wandered off from his bivouac.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=108>The marine tried to roll on his right side, and moaned.</s>
<s snum=109>When he rolled on the left side, propping on his left elbow, Matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over.</s>
<s snum=110>``Be a good turtle''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=111>Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle.</s>
<s snum=112>The smell of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his thoughts.</s>
<s snum=113>In the caves, with other supplies, they had kept cases of sake.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=114>The marine shut his eyes.</s>
<s snum=115>``Are you a thrower of flame, marine''?</s>
<s snum=116>Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground, out of the marine's reach and away from their shadows.</s>
<s snum=117>He waited in his squat, gripping the hair.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=118>Every so often he turned the knife.</s>
<s snum=119>Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight.</s>
<s snum=120>The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was dripping.</s>
<s snum=121>Wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an oily film.</s>
<s snum=122>The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes.</s>
<s snum=123>Now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle.</s>
<s snum=124>He must have saturated himself in the drink, for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze.</s>
<s snum=125>Matsuo shook his head.</s>
<s snum=126>Strange.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=127>At last he reached for the knife.</s>
<s snum=128>Even the bone handle scorched, and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief to wrap it.</s>
<s snum=129>First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes.</s>
<s snum=130>The marine yelled and flung the hand away.</s>
<s snum=131>With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek.</s>
<s snum=132>A shrill yelp, kicked legs, and groping hands that circled Matsuo's wrist.</s>
<s snum=133>Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat; burned the other cheek; burned each hand when they came groping again.</s>
<s snum=134>The marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=135>Matsuo stood up.</s>
<s snum=136>``A small measure of payment, marine''.</s>
<s snum=137>He dropped the knife in its scabbard, hung the rifle behind a shoulder.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=138>The marine, hands on cheeks, rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach.</s>
<s snum=139>He ceased weeping.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=140>Matsuo walked toward his tree, once glancing back.</s>
<s snum=141>The marine was still.</s>
<s snum=142>He would soon die.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=143>As Matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk, a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow.</s>
<s snum=144>What now?</s>
<s snum=145>In the jungle, birds were mute, while insects preserved only the monotony of living.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=146>Someone called.</s>
<s snum=147>It was the marine: head lifted, he strained and called.</s>
<s snum=148>Then he astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat.</s>
<s snum=149>He cupped his mouth and yelled.</s>
<s snum=150>Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder.</s>
<s snum=151>Once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die.</s>
<s snum=152>He aimed, but listened.</s>
<s snum=153>It sounded as if the man were calling him: ``Hey, Japanese &&& hey there, Japanese''.</s>
<s snum=154>The man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container.</s>
<s snum=155>He performed the act twice more, and the begging in his tone grew more distinct.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=156>``Sake''?</s>
<s snum=157>Matsuo called.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=158>The marine nodded vigorously.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=159>Matsuo laughed, slung the rifle.</s>
<s snum=160>The marine was a winehead.</s>
<s snum=161>His superiors had said that all marines were depraved.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=162>The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol.</s>
<s snum=163>Remembering his own thirst, Matsuo took out his water bottle.</s>
<s snum=164>One swallow was all he would have; he was very thirsty, but he must observe water discipline.</s>
<s snum=165>His years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=166>He began to uncap the bottle, the rusty cap squealing on its threads.</s>
<s snum=167>Popping upright, the marine waved both hands and shouted.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=168>Of course it was water he really craved; down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out.</s>
<s snum=169>The marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack.</s>
<s snum=170>Matsuo shook his head.</s>
<s snum=171>He had no water for an enemy.</s>
<s snum=172>And when this was gone, he hadn't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=173>He capped the bottle and replaced it.</s>
<s snum=174>After all, he had less reason to desire it than the marine.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=175>Before much longer the marine quieted down.</s>
<s snum=176>His head slumped.</s>
<s snum=177>The upper part of his packet had stained dark.</s>
<s snum=178>``Marine.</s>
<s snum=179>There is nothing for you'', Matsuo said.</s>
<s snum=180>``Your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion, besides the dishonor of it.</s>
<s snum=181>I've nothing for you''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=182>From the convulsive quivers of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping.</s>
<s snum=183>He reminded Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China.</s>
<s snum=184>In China it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform, smudged, blood-specked, with the village burning about him and shells exploding.</s>
