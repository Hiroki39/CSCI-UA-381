</p>
<hl>THE AMERICAN REGISTRY OF PATHOLOGY</hl>
<p>
<s snum=30>This consists of 25 individual registries, two of which were added during fiscal years 1959-1960 (the Registry of Forensic Pathology and the Testicular Tumor Registry).</s>
<s snum=31>These registries are sponsored by 18 national medical, dental, and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural history of various diseases of military-medical importance.</s>
<s snum=32>The American Registry of Pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in medical research and education between the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the civilian medical profession on a national and international basis, under such conditions as may be agreed upon between the National Research Council and The Surgeons General of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.</s>
<s snum=33>The staff utilized the collected material in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international meetings, exhibits, and published studies.</s>
<s snum=34>During the period of this report, 37,470 new cases were entered into the various registries.</s>

<s snum=40>During this period, 7,827 teaching sets were distributed on loan.</s>
<s snum=41>The Clinico-pathologic Conferences have been acknowledged as of great value and in consequent great demand by the small isolated military hospitals.</s>
<s snum=42>The demand for teaching sets continues unabated since they provide the means for the military physicians to review the pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems for review of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior with structural changes.</s>
</p>
<hl>THE MEDICAL MUSEUM</hl>
<p>
<s snum=43>In fiscal year 1959, the Medical Museum was moved to Chase Hall, a temporary building on Independence Avenue at Ninth Street, Southwest, and continued to display to the public the achievements of the Armed Forces Medical Services.</s>

<hl>ARMED FORCES MEDICAL PUBLICATION AGENCY</hl>
<p>
<s snum=58>The Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency, established in 1949, has published, since January 1950, the United States Armed Forces Medical Journal as a triservice publication to furnish material of professional interest to Medical Department officers of the three military services.</s>
<s snum=59>Its supplement, the Medical Technicians Bulletin, supplied similar material to enlisted medical personnel.</s>
<s snum=60>These publications replaced the U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin, published continuously from 1907 through 1959, as well as the Navy's Hospital Corps Quarterly and the Bulletin of the U. S. Army Medical Department, published from 1922 to 1949.</s>
<s snum=61>In addition, their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated Air Force medical bulletin.</s>
<s snum=62>Estimated annual savings resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin on a triservice basis, as compared with the cost of producing separate periodicals for each service, were between $65,000 and $70,000.</s>
<s snum=63>Additionally, on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations, the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of subscribing to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized, in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>From 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1960, 24 numbers of the Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published.</s>

<s snum=66>The Council on National Defense of the American Medical Association contributed a brief article to each issue entitled, ``This is Your A.M.A.''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=67>Beginning with the October 1959 issue of the Journal, the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was changed from varityping to hot typesetting.</s>
<s snum=68>This resulted in an improved appearance, but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds.</s>
<s snum=69>The use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the May 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly $4,000 in unexpended funds.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=70>Two special issues were published, one for November 1959 on Space Medicine, the other the Tenth Anniversary issue for January 1960.</s>
<s snum=71>The February 1960 issue marked the reinstitution of the section entitled, ``The Medical Officer Writes''.</s>
<s snum=72>Replacing the discontinued Medical Technicians Bulletin, publication of which was suspended with the November-December 1959 issue, a section called ``Technical Notes'' was inaugurated on a bimonthly basis beginning with the April 1960 issue.</s>
<s snum=73>Occasional features were published on historical medicine, special reports, bibliography, and ``Collector's Items''.</s>
<s snum=74>In May 1960, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology began a series of articles on the ``Medical Museum'', and in June, the Institute started contributing a regular monthly ``Case for Diagnosis''.</s>
<s snum=75>The Institute also planned to furnish a regular series of articles, beginning in the fall of 1960, on its more significant Scientific Exhibits.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>The Armed Forces Epidemiological Board agreed to submit each month a report for one of its 12 commissions, so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the Armed Forces.</s>
<s snum=77>The first report in this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue of the Journal.</s>
