<s snum=1>How, he wondered, does one enjoy one's spare time?</s>
<s snum=2>He considered some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk.</s>
<s snum=3>Then there was exercise, boating and hiking, which was not only good for you but also made you more virile: the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted.</s>
<s snum=4>Perhaps golf, with a fashionable companion- but he'd lost his clubs, hadn't played in years.</s>
<s snum=5>There was swimming over at the Riverside Hotel, but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a frog.</s>
<s snum=6>Perhaps a packing trip into the Sierras, let his beard grow- but that was too stark.</s>
<s snum=7>I could, he thought, take a long walk- but where?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=8>The telephone rang.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=9>``You missed it'', Buzz's voice said, ``You should have gone over to the Pagan Room with us.</s>
<s snum=10>Wow.</s>
<s snum=11>Strippers, but scrumptious, and Toodle Williams and her all-lesbian band''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>``Hi, Buzz'', Owen said.</s>
<s snum=13>``I went over to the Willows and dropped two notes''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=14>``Tough'', Buzz said, ``Listen, we're having a stag dinner over at the Pagan Room on Friday.</s>
<s snum=15>Imagine a stag dinner with Toodle Williams''.</s>
<s snum=16>He laughed and laughed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=17>Owen wanted to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next to his, but he hadn't come to Reno for stag dinners.</s>
<s snum=18>``Thanks'', Owen said, ``but Friday is a long way off and anything can happen''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>Buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest.</s>
<s snum=20>When Owen was finally rid of him, there was a timid rap at the door.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=21>``Yes'', Owen called out.</s>
<s snum=22>``Yes''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=23>``I'm Mrs. Gertrude Parker'', a soft voice explained, ``And I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes, please''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=24>Ahah, he thought, a lush divorcee at last.</s>
<s snum=25>Probably saw me in the lobby.</s>
<s snum=26>He was disappointed to find a nervous, scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door.</s>
<s snum=27>She frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow moons.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=28>``How do you do''? she said, semi-professionally.</s>
<s snum=29>``Our church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in Alaska.</s>
<s snum=30>We call them lay-sisters and they go among the Eskimos making friends and bringing the light.</s>
<s snum=31>They're up there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=32>``Oh''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=33>``You see'', she said, looking past him into the room, where the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light, ``you and I can't understand the many hardships they have to undergo''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=34>``Why is that''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>She apparently wasn't satisfied with his reaction.</s>
<s snum=36>Smug, Owen thought, smug and sappy.</s>
<s snum=37>There was a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye.</s>
<s snum=38>It gave her a lewd, winking effect.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=39>``Have you ever tried to reason with an Eskimo''?</s>
<s snum=40>she asked, winking wildly.</s>
<s snum=41>``They are a very difficult group of people''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=42>``I don't know much about them'', Owen admitted, ``but I suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=43>She smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion.</s>
<s snum=44>``You know, that's very interesting.</s>
<s snum=45>People don't know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that.</s>
<s snum=46>The more canvassing I do, the more I note how far most people are from their personal God''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=47>Forebearing, Owen kept his peace.</s>
<s snum=48>What would happen next?</s>
<s snum=49>That she was out for a touch was certain, but when did she get to the pitch?</s>
<s snum=50>Several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated, trying to close the door a little, and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=51>``How did you get by the desk''? he asked curiously.</s>
<s snum=52>``I'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're wandering around the corridors, knocking on strangers' doors and talking down Eskimos''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>``Oh, I just come once a week.</s>
<s snum=54>Every day I visit a different hotel.</s>
<s snum=55>I feel it's my duty.</s>
<s snum=56>I do this work all on my own, because I understand the difficulties and I want to help these lay-sisters.</s>
<s snum=57>Do you know these women go all through Alaska, and they don't have the proper facilities?</s>
<s snum=58>They travel in pairs as much as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=59>``Do you have any idea how far I travel every day?</s>
<s snum=60>I have the whole Pacific Northwest''.</s>
<s snum=61>Owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he couldn't help himself.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=62>Mrs. gertrude Parker drew back.</s>
<s snum=63>``That's hardly a Christian approach'', she remonstrated.</s>
<s snum=64>``You're in the secular world''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=65>``I didn't say it was Christian.</s>
<s snum=66>I don't think you'll find many active Christian salesmen.</s>
<s snum=67>Not that religion isn't big business; those bibles and prayer books make a lot of money for publishing houses, but they don't get top personnel.</s>
<s snum=68>Our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=69>``God, I take it, plays no part in this'', she said waspishly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=70>``God doesn't have any appliance or cosmetics'', he said heatedly before he caught himself.</s>
<s snum=71>It sounded silly; why go on?</s>
<s snum=72>More people were passing; he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=73>``And whiskey'', she said, smiling and blinking at the highball glasses.</s>
<s snum=74>``Don't forget whiskey; it's such a big seller''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>``You know'', he said, getting a grip on himself, ``I think you're going to have to excuse me.</s>
<s snum=76>I have an appointment''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=77>``I can imagine'', she said.</s>
<s snum=78>``Probably down at the bar.</s>
<s snum=79>But what do you want to do about the lay-sisters?</s>
<s snum=80>They must be freezing up there now.</s>
<s snum=81>Can't you help them''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>``Leave a card or something.</s>
<s snum=83>I'll think it over''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>``I have no card'', she said bitterly.</s>
<s snum=85>``You haven't been listening to what I've been telling you.</s>
<s snum=86>I only hope my talking to you has helped you a little, anyway, because you need spiritual bucking-up''.</s>
<s snum=87>She looked crestfallen, as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race.</s>
<s snum=88>She stood indecisively for a moment, then walked down the hall; he heard her knocking on another door.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=89>It took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself; then he realized he was hungry.</s>
<s snum=90>He showered, shaved, dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast.</s>
<s snum=91>On the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail.</s>
<s snum=92>There was a check from his company, and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new lines they always issued.</s>
<s snum=93>His lawyer had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony, and there was a letter from the Collector of Internal Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's exemptions.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=94>He ate breakfast in a sullen mood, but afterwards, when he walked out onto Virginia Street, he felt braced.</s>
<s snum=95>He looked off to the crest of the Sierras, still white-topped; the glisten of the Truckee River made a wide spangle.</s>
<s snum=96>He felt suddenly elated, adventurous.</s>
<s snum=97>With any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=98>Although it was only three o'clock, he stopped in at the Golden Calf.</s>
<s snum=99>The tables were all spinning, the dice rattling, the bar crowded.</s>
<s snum=100>Just to test himself, he played roulette for quarters on his old combination, five and seventeen, and within an hour, he had won, surprisingly, twenty dollars.</s>
<s snum=101>The way was opening up; when the management brought around champagne, the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=102>The Golden Calf was dimly lit with shaded neon.</s>
<s snum=103>There were more women than men in the place, but he couldn't find a flowerpot.</s>
<s snum=104>They all had the hard look of gamblers who had stopped dreaming, who automatically turned the cards, hardly caring what showed up.</s>
<s snum=105>The mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons, who appeared much more animated than the gamblers.</s>
<s snum=106>The women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance, while the men were stern but hopeful.</s>
<s snum=107>All, of course, except the Donner party who were bent on starving to death.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=108>``I wonder if they did eat each other at the end'', Owen mused.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=109>He sat down next to a heavily-upholstered blonde, but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes.</s>
<s snum=110>She sighed a dirty word and left.</s>
<s snum=111>Owen was surprised to see Mrs.Gertrude Parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged by the entrance.</s>
<s snum=112>She sat down and played two slots at once, looking grim, as if bested by mechanical devices, and Owen felt sorry for the lay-sisters depending on her support.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=113>A dried-up cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde's place.</s>
<s snum=114>He was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables.</s>
<s snum=115>``What you need is a steady martingale'', the cowboy announced after watching Owen play.</s>
<s snum=116>``You can't build on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>``What are you playing''?</s>
<s snum=118>Owen asked.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=119>``I'm just logging'', the cowboy explained.</s>
<s snum=120>``I keep all these plays in this little black book, and I watch over a twelve-hour period to find out what numbers are repeating.</s>
<s snum=121>But roulette's not my game.</s>
<s snum=122>I'm always trying to find a breaking table in blackjack.</s>
<s snum=123>Incidentally, I'm pretty famous in these parts: I'm called The Wrangler''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=124>``Nice to know you.</s>
<s snum=125>Don't you have to spend any time on your ranch''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=126>``Well, of course I do.</s>
<s snum=127>I'm with the Bar-~H, pushing a horse called Sparky.</s>
<s snum=128>He's my own horse, and what I collect from him I use on blackjack.</s>
<s snum=129>This Sparky can rack and single-foot and he's the fastest thing in Washoe County.</s>
<s snum=130>I figure if I can get any kind of publicity campaign going, I'll land him on ~TV- you know, one of those favorite horses for some Western hero.</s>
<s snum=131>I once trained a horse for Hoot Gibson, but nothing like Sparky.</s>
<s snum=132>He's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=133>Five came up while Owen was listening to The Wrangler and he neglected to play, a loss of ten dollars.</s>
<s snum=134>This proved conclusively that The Wrangler was a jinx, so he walked on down to Hurrays, an even more glorified gambling den than the Golden Calf.</s>
<s snum=135>When he looked in the back, Mrs. Gertrude Parker was marking keno cards.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=136>His adventurous spirit had waned; he studied the pistol exhibition that Hurrays featured as an added attraction.</s>
<s snum=137>He ogled a long redhead with green eyes, but she was a shill with her money in front of her.</s>
<s snum=138>He had no great prejudice against shills; it just seemed such a dry run.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=139>There was no cash around; everyone was flipping silver dollars.</s>
<s snum=140>The management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers chips or checks or premium points.</s>
<s snum=141>He read a special announcement whereby Hurrays would feature a special floorshow at three a.m. starring Adele (The Body) Brenner and fourteen glamorous schoolgirls.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=142>He wondered if he might bag a tourist, but they looked frightened of him.</s>
<s snum=143>He passed two brides, both wearing orchids, and they made him feel a little sad.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=144>Owen found Buzz watching chuck-a-luck.</s>
<s snum=145>Buzz had on a Hawaiian shirt and was carrying some sun-tan oil and dark glasses.</s>
<s snum=146>He was shorter and fatter than Owen, who felt good standing next to him.</s>
<s snum=147>``We're all going over to Lake Tahoe and try our luck at Cal-Neva'', Buzz explained, still instigating.</s>
<s snum=148>``We ran into a guy at the Pagan Room who guarantees we can beat the wheel.</s>
<s snum=149>He started out as a stickman, then became a pit boss until the Club found him crossroading.</s>
<s snum=150>He was knocking down checks at faro''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=151>``I'm allergic to Tahoe'', Owen explained.</s>
<s snum=152>``Something about the pollen''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=153>``Well, okay'', Buzz said.</s>
<s snum=154>``We'll see you around later''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=155>Owen went over to the crap table and the dice were hot, but he couldn't pyramid with any consecutive success.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=156>``How's your luck, honey''?</s>
<s snum=157>A short platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit addressed him.</s>
<s snum=158>She looked well-fed and prosperous, but he didn't get the impression he was being propositioned the way he'd been hoping.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=159>``I haven't had any luck since I was a baby''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=160>``Stake me'', she said, ``and let me at those dice.</s>
<s snum=161>I'll make them dance the tango.</s>
<s snum=162>We'll get it in a hurry and get it out''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=163>``Let's have a drink and discuss a merger''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=164>``If you go broke'', she said, smiling up at him, ``I'll leave you''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=165>``Sounds like real love'', Owen said.</s>
<s snum=166>``It sort of brings a lump to my throat''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=167>``My name's Gisele'', the blonde said after she ordered a Scotch.</s>
<s snum=168>``Named after the ballet.</s>
<s snum=169>My mother wanted to call me Sylphide, but it sounded too affected''.</s>
