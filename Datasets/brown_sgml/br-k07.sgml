<s snum=1>If the crummy bastard could write!</s>
<s snum=2>That's how it should be.</s>
<s snum=3>It's those two fucken niggers!</s>
<s snum=4>Krist, I wish they could write!</s>
<s snum=5>Nigger pussy.</s>
<s snum=6>He thought of sweet wet nigger pussy.</s>
<s snum=7>Oh, sweet land of heaven, haint there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy!</s>
<s snum=8>He thought of her, the first one.</s>
<s snum=9>He had caught her coming out of the shack.</s>
<s snum=10>She was a juicy one.</s>
<s snum=11>Oh how they bounced!</s>
<s snum=12>Fresh, warm, sweet and juicy, sweet lovin sixteen, she was.</s>
<s snum=13>Man how I love nigger pussy!</s>
<s snum=14>The snow came a little faster now, he noted.</s>
<s snum=15>He thought of Joe Harris, the nigger who had gone after his sister.</s>
<s snum=16>He chuckled, the memory vivid.</s>
<s snum=17>Jee- sus, We Fixed him!</s>
<s snum=18>Yooee, we fixed him!</s>
<s snum=19>The snow again.</s>
<s snum=20>If only the fucken weather wasn't so lousy!</s>
<s snum=21>Goddamn niggers, Lord.</s>
<s snum=22>What I have to put up with!</s>
<s snum=23>Sonuvabitch, I can't figure out what in hell for they went and put niggers in my squad for.</s>
<s snum=24>Only one worth a shit, and that's Brandon.</s>
<s snum=25>He ain't so bad.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>His thoughts turned to other things.</s>
<s snum=27>The big shock everybody had when they found ol Slater and those others done for.</s>
<s snum=28>Kaboom for.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=29>He had been pretty scared himself, wondering what the hell was coming off.</s>
<s snum=30>But he soon saw which way the ball was bouncing.</s>
<s snum=31>Soon came back to his senses.</s>
<s snum=32>``I soon came back to my senses'', he said, aloud, to the young blizzard, proudly, drawing himself up, as if making a report to some important superior.</s>
<s snum=33>I was the first to get my squad on the ball, and anybody thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb.</s>
<s snum=34>Look at thum.</s>
<s snum=35>That goddamn redheader was the worst.</s>
<s snum=36>He kept sayin, not me, not me, I don't wanta wind up like em.</s>
<s snum=37>But I told him, goddammit.</s>
<s snum=38>``I told him'', he said aloud.</s>
<s snum=39>``They'll get the guys that done it.</s>
<s snum=40>That'll put the place back to normal.</s>
<s snum=41>Normal, by God.</s>
<s snum=42>Maybe it's a good thing it happened.</s>
<s snum=43>Maybe they'll stop it now, once for all.</s>
<s snum=44>Clean the place up.</s>
<s snum=45>They're doin it now.</s>
<s snum=46>I hear the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow.</s>
<s snum=47>They'll get the guys that done it''.</s>
<s snum=48>There was something troubling him though: as yet they hadn't.</s>
<s snum=49>Five days.</s>
<s snum=50>Keerist.</s>
<s snum=51>Prickly twinges of annoyance ran through him.</s>
<s snum=52>His eyes blinked hard, snapping on and squashing some bad things that were trying to push their way into him.</s>
<s snum=53>A tune began to whirl inside his head.</s>
<s snum=54>One of his favorites: ``Guitar Boogie''.</s>
<s snum=55>It always came on, faithfully, just like a radio or juke box, whenever he started to worry too much about something, when the bad things tried to push their way into him.</s>
<s snum=56>The music drove them off, or away, and he was free to walk on air in a very few moments, humming and jiving within, beating the rhythm within.</s>
<s snum=57>He glowed with anticipation about what would happen to the culprits when they caught them.</s>
<s snum=58>Turn the bastards over to me- to me and my boys- no nigger ever got what would be comin to them- reactionary bastards.</s>
<s snum=59>He had never heard the word reactionary before his life as a ~POW began.</s>
<s snum=60>It was a word he was proud of, a word that meant much to him, and he used it with great pleasure, almost as if it were an exclusive possession, and more: he sensed himself to be very highly educated, four cuts above any of the folks back home.</s>
<s snum=61>``Four cuts at least'', he chuckled to himself, ``and I owe it all to them''.</s>
<s snum=62>The word also made him feel hate, sincere hate, for those so labeled.</s>
<s snum=63>He used it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball.</s>
<s snum=64>It came up again and again in the discussion sessions.</s>
<s snum=65>Lousy Reactionary bastards been tryin to fuck up the Program for months.</s>
<s snum=66>Months.</s>
<s snum=67>Hired, hard lackeys of the Warmongering Capitalists.</s>
<s snum=68>Not captured, sent here.</s>
<s snum=69>To fuck up the Program.</s>
<s snum=70>You guys remember that.</s>
<s snum=71>Remember that.</s>
<s snum=72>He heard himself haranguing them.</s>
<s snum=73>He saw himself before them delivering the speech.</s>
<s snum=74>He laughed, suddenly, feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them, seeing himself before them, receiving utmost respect and attention.</s>
<s snum=75>One day, Ching had told him (smiling, patting him on the back) as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders, ``Keep it up, your squad is good, one of the best, keep it up, keep up the good work''.</s>
<s snum=76>He would!</s>
<s snum=77>That was really something, coming from Ching.</s>
<s snum=78>``Really something'', he said, aloud.</s>
<s snum=79>Dirty Reactionary bastards comin down here in the night and bumpin off ol Slater and those other poor bastards.</s>
<s snum=80>``They'll get them by God and let them bring them down here to me, just let them, God I'll slice their balls right off''.</s>
<s snum=81>His arm moved swiftly, violently, once, twice.</s>
<s snum=82>He felt intense satisfaction.</s>
<s snum=83>He was tingling within.</s>
<s snum=84>Before him, mutilated, bleeding to death, they lay.</s>
<s snum=85>It was as if it had been done.</s>
<s snum=86>``Bastards'', he said aloud, spitting on them.</s>
<s snum=87>He halted, and looked around.</s>
<s snum=88>Rivers of cold sweat were suddenly unleashed within him.</s>
<s snum=89>The thought came back, the one nagging at him these past four days.</s>
<s snum=90>He tried to stifle it.</s>
<s snum=91>But the words were forming.</s>
<s snum=92>He knew he couldn't.</s>
<s snum=93>He braced himself.</s>
<s snum=94>Somebody'll hafta start thinkin.</s>
<s snum=95>He fought it, seeking to kill the last few words, but on they came ``bout takin- his''.</s>
<s snum=96>He was trembling, a strange feeling upon him, fully expecting some catastrophe to strike him dead on the spot.</s>
<s snum=97>But it didn't.</s>
<s snum=98>And he took heart; the final word came forth ``place''.</s>
<s snum=99>Now he heard it, fully: ``bout takin his place''.</s>
<s snum=100>He listened, waited, nothing happened.</s>
<s snum=101>He felt good.</s>
<s snum=102>His old self.</s>
<s snum=103>The music arrived, taking him, its rhythm stroked him, snaked all through him, the lyrics lifted him, took him from one magic isle to another, stopping briefly at each.</s>
<s snum=104>Brandon.</s>
<s snum=105>He is good.</s>
<s snum=106>Damn good.</s>
<s snum=107>But a nigger.</s>
<s snum=108>Johnson.</s>
<s snum=109>Jesus, the guy says he is trying.</s>
<s snum=110>But he isn't with it, not at all with it.</s>
<s snum=111>When I talked to Ching about it, he said, Everyone can learn, if he is not a Reactionary or lazy.</s>
<s snum=112>No one is stupid.</s>
<s snum=113>That's what he said.</s>
<s snum=114>He oughta know.</s>
<s snum=115>It is plain as hell Johnson is no Reactionary.</s>
<s snum=116>So you're not tryin, Johnson, you bastard you.</s>
<s snum=117>He looked over at him, lying there, asleep, and he felt a wave of revulsion.</s>
<s snum=118>How he loathed him.</s>
<s snum=119>Sleepy-eyed, soft-spoken Johnson.</s>
<s snum=120>Biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad.</s>
<s snum=121>He was the guy what always goofed at Question Time.</s>
<s snum=122>Why couldn't they have dumped him off on someone else?</s>
<s snum=123>Why me?</s>
<s snum=124>Why didn't the damn Reactionaries bump him off?</s>
<s snum=125>Why Slater?</s>
<s snum=126>Like a particle drawn to a magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard in his mind.</s>
<s snum=127>The music surged up, but it failed to check it.</s>
<s snum=128>Who is the man to take His place?</s>
<s snum=129>The guy with most on the Ball.</s>
<s snum=130>Most on the Ball.</s>
<s snum=131>Handle men.</s>
<s snum=132>Thoroughly Wised Up.</s>
<s snum=133>Knows the score.</s>
<s snum=134>With a supreme effort, he broke it off.</s>
<s snum=135>He turned to the window again.</s>
<s snum=136>A gnawing and gnashing within him.</s>
<s snum=137>The snow was tumbling down furiously now.</s>
<s snum=138>Huge glob-flakes hitting the ground, piling higher and higher.</s>
<s snum=139>He stared at it, amazed, alarmed.</s>
<s snum=140>The whole fucken sky's cavin in!</s>
<s snum=141>Keeeerist!</s>
<s snum=142>Lookit it!</s>
<s snum=143>Cover the whole building, bury us all, by nightfall.</s>
<s snum=144>Jesus!</s>
<s snum=145>Somebody, got to be somebody.</s>
<s snum=146>If I don't put my two cents in soon, somebody else will.</s>
<s snum=147>I know they're waitin only for one thing:</s>
<s snum=148>for the bastards what done it to be nailed.</s>
<s snum=149>Maybe they already got them.</s>
<s snum=150>He was again tingling with pleasure, seeing himself clearly in Slater's shoes.</s>
<s snum=151>Top dog, sleeping and eating right there with the Staff.</s>
<s snum=152>Ching, Tien, all of them.</s>
<s snum=153>Top dog.</s>
<s snum=154>Poor ol Slater.</s>
<s snum=155>Jesus, imagine, the crummy bastards, they'll get em, they'll get what's comin to em **h He whirled about suddenly.</s>
<s snum=156>It was nothing, though his heart was thumping wildly.</s>
<s snum=157>Somebody was up.</s>
<s snum=158>That was all.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=159>``Boy, you're stirrin early'', a sleepy voice said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=160>``Yehhh'', said Coughlin, testily, eyeing him up and down.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=161>``Lookit that come down, willya'', said the man, scratching himself, yawning.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=162>``Yehhh'', said Coughlin, practically spitting on him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=163>The man moved away.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=164>That's the way.</s>
<s snum=165>They'll toe the line.</s>
<s snum=166>Goddamn it.</s>
<s snum=167>Keep the chatter to a minimum, short answers, one word, if possible.</s>
<s snum=168>Less bull the more you can do with um.</s>
<s snum=169>That's Brown's trouble.</s>
<s snum=170>All he does is to bullshit with his squad, and they are the stupidest bastards around.</s>
<s snum=171>Just about to get their asses kicked into hut Seven.</s>
<s snum=172>Plenty of room there now.</s>
<s snum=173>All those dumb 8-Balls croaked.</s>
<s snum=174>You can do anything with these dumb fucks if you know how.</s>
<s snum=175>Anything.</s>
<s snum=176>They'd cut their mothers' belly open.</s>
<s snum=177>Give um the works.</s>
<s snum=178>See, he's already snapping it up, the dumb jerk **h Coughlin grinned, feeling supremely on top of things **h He watched the snow once again.</s>
<s snum=179>It infuriated him.</s>
<s snum=180>It made no sense to him **h He whirled around, suddenly hot all over, finding the man who had been standing before him a few moments back, nailing him to the spot on which he now stood, open-mouthed- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=181>``You- Listen!</s>
<s snum=182>- name William Foster's Four Internal Contradictions in Capitalism.</s>
<s snum=183>Quick- Quick- Now''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=184>The man shrank before the hot fury, searching frantically for the answer **h </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=185>Finnegan woke up.</s>
<s snum=186>There was a hell of a noise this time of morning.</s>
<s snum=187>He stared out the window.</s>
<s snum=188>For Christ's sake!</s>
<s snum=189>The whole fucken sky's caved in!</s>
<s snum=190>He looked for the source of the noise that had awakened him **h It was that prick Coughlin.</s>
<s snum=191>What the hell was he up to now?</s>
<s snum=192>Why didn't he drop dead?</s>
<s snum=193>How did they miss him when they got Slater?</s>
<s snum=194>How?</s>
<s snum=195>**h Then he was asking himself the usual early morning questions: What the Hell am I doin here?</s>
<s snum=196>Is this a nut-house?</s>
<s snum=197>Am I nuts?</s>
<s snum=198>Is this for real?</s>
<s snum=199>Am I dreamin?</s>
<s snum=200>**h </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=201>From somewhere in the hut came Coughlin's voice.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=202>``How long did you study?</s>
<s snum=203>How long, buddy''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=204>``For Christ's sake''! a voice pleaded.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=205>``Don't Christsake me, buddy!</s>
<s snum=206>Just answer.</s>
<s snum=207>C'mon- c'mon!'' </s>
<s snum=208>**h I'm no hero.</s>
<s snum=209>Did I start the damn war?</s>
<s snum=210>**h Automatically, Finnegan started going over today's lesson **h Capitalism rots from the core.</s>
<s snum=211>Did I start the damn war?</s>
<s snum=212>Who did?</s>
<s snum=213>That's a good one.</s>
<s snum=214>I thought I knew.</s>
<s snum=215>Why don't Uncle Sam mind his own fucken business?</s>
<s snum=216>I'll bet both together did.</s>
<s snum=217>I bet.</s>
<s snum=218>So fuck them both.</s>
<s snum=219>Goddamn.</s>
<s snum=220>Goddammit.</s>
<s snum=221>Just let me go home to Jersey, back to the shore, oh, Jesus, the shore.</s>
<s snum=222>The waves breakin in on you and your girl at night there on the warm beach in the moonlight even Jesus sweet Mary.</s>
<s snum=223>If I hafta do this to stay alive by God I'll do it.</s>
<s snum=224>I hated the goddamn army from the first day I got in anyhow.</s>
<s snum=225>All pricks like Coughlin run it anyway, one way or another.</s>
<s snum=226>Fuck them **h He rolled over and tried to shut out the noise, now much louder.</s>
<s snum=227>He snuggled into the blanket **h </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=228>Brandon dreamed.</s>
<s snum=229>He was sitting on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water.</s>
<s snum=230>A river, wide as the Missouri, where it ran by his place.</s>
<s snum=231>The log was spinning.</s>
<s snum=232>But he was not.</s>
<s snum=233>So what?</s>
<s snum=234>Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning?</s>
<s snum=235>(he asked this out loud, but no one heard it over the other noise in the hut).</s>
<s snum=236>Over on the bank, the west bank, a man stood, calling to him.</s>
<s snum=237>He couldn't make out what he was saying.</s>
<s snum=238>No doubt it had to do with the log.</s>
<s snum=239>Why should he be concerned?</s>
