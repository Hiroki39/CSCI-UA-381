<s snum=1>Temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85-90`F. (29-32`C.).</s>
<s snum=2>The top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs..</s>
<s snum=3>Sixty lbs. loading is possible but 40 lbs.is adequate.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=4>The suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe (thus returning suds to soap box) and the machine is started.</s>
<s snum=5>The 160-ml.bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen.</s>
<s snum=6>Washing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls.</s>
<s snum=7>At the conclusion of the washing, 8 liters of water at 90`F. (32`C.) are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs, 4 liters to each tub.</s>
<s snum=8>This operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes.</s>
<s snum=9>During the rinsing operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow from the main drain begins.</s>
<s snum=10>At this point the drains are readjusted so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the 2-1/2 mark on the drain gauge.</s>
<s snum=11>When all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs.</s>
<s snum=12>The run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=13>By this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages, first by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water, since soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the nip passes directly to waste from the suds box drains.</s>
<s snum=14>This method of rinsing appears to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition.</s>
</p>
<hl>SUGGESTED EVALUATION AND CLASSIFICATION</hl>
<p>
<s snum=15>Evaluation may be made on either a soil-removal or a grease-removal basis as desired.</s>
<s snum=16>A reflectance-measuring instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning, whereas Soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal.</s>
</p>
<hl>PURPOSE AND SCOPE</hl>
<p>
<s snum=17>This test method is intended for determining the dimensional changes of woven or knitted fabrics, made of fibers other than wool, to be expected when the cloth is subjected to laundering procedures commonly used in the commercial laundry and the home.</s>
<s snum=18>Four washing test procedures are established, varying in severity from very severe to very mild, and are intended to cover the range of practical washing from commercial procedure to hand washing.</s>
<s snum=19>Five drying test procedures are established to cover the range of drying techniques used in the home and commercial laundry.</s>
<s snum=20>Three methods for determining the dimensional restorability characteristics are established for those textiles which require restoration by ironing or wearing after laundering.</s>
<s snum=21>These tests are not accelerated and must be repeated to evaluate dimensional changes after repeated launderings.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=22>Table /1, summarizes all of the various washing, drying, and restoration procedures available.</s>
<s snum=23>The person using these tests must determine which combination of procedures is practical for any specific item in order to evaluate the dimensional changes of textile fabrics or garments after laundering procedures commonly used in the home or commercial laundry.</s>
<s snum=24>It is possible to identify the test procedure completely with a code consisting of a Roman Numeral, a letter, and an Arabic number.</s>
<s snum=25>For example Test /3, ~E 1 refers to a specimen which has been washed by procedure ``/3,'' (at 160`F.for a total of 60 minutes in the machine, has been dried in a tumble dryer by procedure ``~E'' and has been subjected to restorative forces on the Tension Presser by procedure ``1''.</s>
</p>
<hl>PRINCIPLE</hl>
<p>
<s snum=26>A specimen or garment is washed in a cylindrical reversing wash wheel, dried and subjected to restorative forces where necessary.</s>
<s snum=27>Temperature and time of agitation in the wash wheel are varied to obtain different degrees of severity.</s>
<s snum=28>Drying procedures and application of restorative force procedures are varied to conform with end-use handling during home or commercial laundering.</s>
<s snum=29>Distances marked on the specimen in warp and filling directions (or wales and courses for knitted fabrics) are measured before and after laundering.</s>

</p>
<hl>TEST SPECIMENS</hl>
<p>
<s snum=53>The preparation of test specimens will vary depending upon the type of dimensional restorability procedure (if any) to be used.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=54>Three specimens for each sample to be tested are required in order to arrive at a satisfactory average of performance.</s>
<s snum=55>This is especially true for knitted fabrics.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=56>Specimens are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium with a standard atmosphere of **f and **f and then laid out without tension on a flat, polished surface, care being taken that the fabric is free from wrinkles or creases.</s>
<s snum=57>Fabrics that are badly distorted in their unlaundered state due to faulty finishing may give deceptive dimensional change results when laundered by any procedure.</s>
<s snum=58>This also holds true if restorative forces are applied.</s>
<s snum=59>Therefore, it is recommended that in such cases the sample be replaced, or if used, the results of dimensional change or dimensional restorability tests be considered as indicative only.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=60>Generally, it is necessary to mark distances on a specimen (or garment) in both lengthwise and widthwise directions and to measure before and after laundering.</s>
<s snum=61>The distances may be marked with indelible ink and a fine-point pen, by sewing fine threads into the fabric, or by a specially designed stamping machine.</s>
<s snum=62>The marked distances are parallel to the respective yarns.</s>
<s snum=63>Usually, the greater the original distances marked, the greater will be the accuracy of the test.</s>
