<s snum=1>The sentry was not dead.</s>
<s snum=2>He was, in fact, showing signs of reviving.</s>
<s snum=3>He had been carrying an Enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol.</s>
<s snum=4>A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard.</s>
<s snum=5>He was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat.</s>
<s snum=6>Mike stripped these from him and donned them.</s>
<s snum=7>He and Dean tied and gagged the man, using his belt and shirt for the purpose.</s>
<s snum=8>They dragged him inside the building.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=9>Fiske joined them, unsteady on his feet.</s>
<s snum=10>Julia, seeing the bandage, rushed to him.</s>
<s snum=11>``You are hurt''!</s>
<s snum=12>she breathed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=13>``I never felt better in my life'', Fiske blustered.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=14>He turned to Susan and kissed her on the cheek.</s>
<s snum=15>``Thank you, My dear'', he said.</s>
<s snum=16>``You are very brave''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=17>Mike silenced them.</s>
<s snum=18>``We'll talk later.</s>
<s snum=19>First, we've got to get out of here''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=20>``We'll grab horses'', Dean said.</s>
<s snum=21>``The main bunch is outside, but there are some over there inside the wall''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=22>Mike debated it, trying to decide whether Fiske was strong enough to ride.</s>
<s snum=23>But it at least offered him a chance for living.</s>
<s snum=24>He had none here.</s>
<s snum=25>And, for the sake of Julia and Susan, it had to be tried.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>The guerrilla bivouac remained silent.</s>
<s snum=27>Light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground.</s>
<s snum=28>Someone evidently was on duty there.</s>
<s snum=29>No doubt there would be men guarding the horses.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>About a dozen animals were held inside the stockade, as best Mike could make out in the moonlight.</s>
<s snum=31>Evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=32>He handed the guard's rifle to Fiske.</s>
<s snum=33>``Dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride'', he said.</s>
<s snum=34>``We'll stampede the rest.</s>
<s snum=35>You stay with the ladies.</s>
<s snum=36>All of you be ready to ride hell for leather''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=37>He added, ``If this doesn't work out, the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms with them''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=38>He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol.</s>
<s snum=39>Susan halted Dean and kissed him.</s>
<s snum=40>She clung to him, talking to him, and dabbing at her eyes.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=41>Mike turned away.</s>
<s snum=42>He was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant what he had believed it had.</s>
<s snum=43>He felt unutterably weary.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=44>Dean turned from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms.</s>
<s snum=45>He kissed her also, and with deep tenderness.</s>
<s snum=46>She too began to weep.</s>
<s snum=47>He released her and joined Mike.</s>
<s snum=48>``All right'', he said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>Mike only said, ``Later''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=50>``Be careful, McLish''!</s>
<s snum=51>Susan said fiercely.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>``The way you were careful''? he snorted.</s>
<s snum=53>``Running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=54>He kept going.</s>
<s snum=55>He wanted no more sentimental scenes with her.</s>
<s snum=56>He might say or do something foolish.</s>
<s snum=57>Something all of them would regret.</s>
<s snum=58>He might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself, pretending to be blind to the way Julia Fortune had taken Dean's affections from her.</s>
<s snum=59>And using him, Mike McLish, as a sop to her pride.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=60>He handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol.</s>
<s snum=61>``Stay well back of me'', he said.</s>
<s snum=62>``I'm going to walk up to the horses, bold as brass, pretending I'm one of the guerrillas.</s>
<s snum=63>There's bound to be someone on guard, but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>Holding the pistol concealed, he walked to the rear wall of the stockade.</s>
<s snum=65>It was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings.</s>
<s snum=66>One wing stood open.</s>
<s snum=67>Mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses.</s>
<s snum=68>They were tethered, army style, on stable lines.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=69>A voice spoke near-at-hand.</s>
<s snum=70>``Who's thet''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>Just me``, Mike said.</s>
<s snum=72>''Is that you, Bill``?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=73>He located his man.</s>
<s snum=74>The guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight.</s>
<s snum=75>Mike kept walking and got within arm's reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>Mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol.</s>
<s snum=77>But the luck that had been running their way left him.</s>
<s snum=78>The guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle.</s>
<s snum=79>He tried to veer the rifle around to fire into Mike's body.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=80>Mike, off balance, managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded.</s>
<s snum=81>The bullet went wide.</s>
<s snum=82>Mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash.</s>
<s snum=83>This time it connected solidly on the man's temple, felling him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>The explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills.</s>
<s snum=85>The startled horses began rearing on their tethers.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=86>Dean came rushing up.</s>
<s snum=87>``Are you hit''? he demanded.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=88>``No, but the fat's in the fire''!</s>
<s snum=89>Mike said.</s>
<s snum=90>``There's no chance now of all of us getting away.</s>
<s snum=91>You'll have to try it alone''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=92>The sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby, having been kept handy in case of need.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=93>Mike took the bayonet from Dean's hand and slashed the picket line.</s>
<s snum=94>``Up you go''! he said.</s>
<s snum=95>``Ride''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=96>Dean resisted Mike's attempt to push him toward the horse.</s>
<s snum=97>``Why not you''? he protested.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=98>``Dammit''!</s>
<s snum=99>Mike said frantically.</s>
<s snum=100>``You're lighter than me.</s>
<s snum=101>It's our only chance now.</s>
<s snum=102>Try to find these Feds.</s>
<s snum=103>The rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back.</s>
<s snum=104>You're the one that's taking the big chance''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=105>Dean still hesitated, but Mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=106>``No telling how good this horse is'', Mike panted.</s>
<s snum=107>``Favor him and save something in case you hit trouble.</s>
<s snum=108>Watch out for Apaches when it comes daylight.</s>
<s snum=109>Take the pistol.</s>
<s snum=110>You might need it.</s>
<s snum=111>We'll still have the rifle, and I might be able to round up some more.</s>
<s snum=112>I'll stampede the rest of these horses so they can't chase you''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=113>Dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back.</s>
<s snum=114>``McLish'', he said as he kicked the horse into motion, ``I'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=115>Then he was on his way at a gallop.</s>
<s snum=116>Mike ran down the line, slashing picket ropes with the bayonet.</s>
<s snum=117>He lifted a screeching war whoop.</s>
<s snum=118>That touched off a total stampede.</s>
<s snum=119>He darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there.</s>
<s snum=120>These poured through the gate and joined the flight.</s>
<s snum=121>The animals thundered away into the moonlight, heading for the ridges.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=122>The guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=123>``'Paches''!</s>
<s snum=124>Mike yelled.</s>
<s snum=125>``They're stealin' the stock''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=126>He scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings.</s>
<s snum=127>He crouched there.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=128>His shout had been taken up and repeated.</s>
<s snum=129>The guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses.</s>
<s snum=130>All were carrying guns they had seized up, but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=131>Durkin and Calhoun came running from the post.</s>
<s snum=132>They had pistols in their hands.</s>
<s snum=133>They bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar.</s>
<s snum=134>They followed the others toward the east gate.</s>
<s snum=135>Beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were Apaches.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=136>Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings.</s>
<s snum=137>He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner.</s>
<s snum=138>The area was deserted.</s>
<s snum=139>A man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left, but he, too, suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=140>Mike crawled to the door and peered in.</s>
<s snum=141>The orderly room seemed to be deserted.</s>
<s snum=142>A lantern hung from a peg, giving light.</s>
<s snum=143>Ducking inside, he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner.</s>
<s snum=144>A brace of pistols, holstered on belts, hung from a peg, along with ammunition pouches.</s>
<s snum=145>An ammunition case stood open, containing canisters which contained powder cartridges.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=146>Mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner, spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=147>Shouldering the load he peered from the door.</s>
<s snum=148>His looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=149>He looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons, struck by a new inspiration.</s>
<s snum=150>He set his bundle down.</s>
<s snum=151>Snatching the lantern from its peg, he shattered its globe with a blow against a post.</s>
<s snum=152>He picked up the powder canister and ran out.</s>
<s snum=153>Bursting paper cartridges, he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=154>He shouldered the blanket again, backed off, and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon.</s>
<s snum=155>He turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=156>Powder flame gushed beneath the wagon.</s>
<s snum=157>The stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him.</s>
<s snum=158>They realized the truth.</s>
<s snum=159>Bullets began to snap past him.</s>
<s snum=160>One struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack.</s>
<s snum=161>Its force spun him around, but he recovered and got into stride again.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=162>A bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety.</s>
<s snum=163>Another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=164>Guerrillas were racing toward him.</s>
<s snum=165>Susan and Julia came from the door and dragged him with them.</s>
<s snum=166>The three of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=167>Susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door.</s>
<s snum=168>She crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal, chewing into the planks.</s>
<s snum=169>Some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak.</s>
<s snum=170>The iron hinges held, but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=171>mike rolled to Susan, grasped her around the knees, dragging her off her feet.</s>
<s snum=172>He hovered over her to shield her, for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=173>He peered from a loophole.</s>
<s snum=174>Guerrillas were only a dozen yards away, charging the house.</s>
<s snum=175>Mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired.</s>
<s snum=176>He dropped a man with the first bullet.</s>
<s snum=177>At the same moment Wheeler Fiske fired the rifle Mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit.</s>
<s snum=178>That halted the rush.</s>
<s snum=179>The guerrillas scattered for cover.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=180>The wagons were burning fiercely.</s>
<s snum=181>The mudwagon had caught fire also.</s>
<s snum=182>The blaze was spreading to the frame buildings.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=183>The guerrillas realized they faced a new problem.</s>
<s snum=184>``Gawdamighty''! one screeched.</s>
<s snum=185>``There goes our grub an' ammunition''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=186>``Get a bucket line going''!</s>
<s snum=187>Calhoun shouted.</s>
<s snum=188>``Hurry!</s>
<s snum=189>Hurry''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=190>The guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring.</s>
<s snum=191>But what few containers they found were inadequate.</s>
<s snum=192>Many of them, in increasing panic, came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort.</s>
<s snum=193>Both buildings were in flames.</s>
<s snum=194>The heat drove the guerrillas back.</s>
<s snum=195>The roof of the command post began to buckle.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=196>``Drag the wagons to the spring''!</s>
<s snum=197>Lew Durkin yelled.</s>
<s snum=198>``Run 'em right into the spring!</s>
<s snum=199>Hustle''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=200>One of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame.</s>
<s snum=201>A sizable supply of powder had been touched off.</s>
<s snum=202>The wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=203>The glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows, giving light enough to examine Mike's wound.</s>
<s snum=204>The bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee, inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor.</s>
<s snum=205>But it had missed the bone and had passed on through.</s>
<s snum=206>Susan and Julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=207>Mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it.</s>
