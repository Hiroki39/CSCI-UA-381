<s snum=1>There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot.</s>
<s snum=2>The new Riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop.</s>
<s snum=3>For a few innings the Anniston team couldn't figure him out.</s>
<s snum=4>Then, in the fifth, Anniston's kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center field.</s>
<s snum=5>@ Eddie Lee, Riverside's redheaded playing manager, ran after the ball but it rolled past him.</s>
<s snum=6>Phil Rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the relay.</s>
<s snum=7>Eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil.</s>
<s snum=8>@ ``Third!</s>
<s snum=9>Third base''!</s>
<s snum=10>Eddie shouted.</s>
<s snum=11>@ Phil spun around and made an accurate throw into Mike Deegan's hands on third base.</s>
<s snum=12>Mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag.</s>
<s snum=13>But the Anniston boy had begun his slide too late.</s>
<s snum=14>He came into the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in his face.</s>
<s snum=15>@ ``You bastard''! the Anniston catcher screamed.</s>
<s snum=16>He jumped to his feet and started to throw punches.</s>
<s snum=17>Mike Deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher.</s>
<s snum=18>This brought in everybody from both sides, while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar.</s>
<s snum=19>@ The fighters were separated in a few minutes.</s>
<s snum=20>The game was resumed.</s>
<s snum=21>But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now.</s>
<s snum=22>When the inning was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all the way into the dugout.</s>
<s snum=23>@ Phil Rossoff, coming in from left field, stopped at the water fountain for a drink.</s>
<s snum=24>Mike Deegan was standing beside it, facing the field.</s>
<s snum=25>He was eyeing the Anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began.</s>
<s snum=26>@ ``Keep your eyes open, sonny''!</s>
<s snum=27>Mike yelled to the catcher.</s>
<s snum=28>``You're in for trouble''.</s>
<s snum=29>@ The Anniston catcher did not reply with words.</s>
<s snum=30>He simply turned to Mike and smiled.</s>
<s snum=31>This so infuriated Deegan that he spun around and said: ``I'll get that little bastard.</s>
<s snum=32>So help me God, I'll get him''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=33>Phil Rossoff said: ``Why don't you leave him alone''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=34>``Mind your own goddamn business'', Mike Deegan said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>Phil shrugged.</s>
<s snum=36>He stepped into the dugout, wondering why Deegan was always looking for trouble.</s>
<s snum=37>Maybe the answer was in his eyes.</s>
<s snum=38>When Deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=39>In the last of the sixth inning Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielder's head.</s>
<s snum=40>By the time the fielder got his hands on the ball Deegan was rounding third base and heading for home.</s>
<s snum=41>The left fielder threw and it was a good one.</s>
<s snum=42>But Mike had no chance of being tagged.</s>
<s snum=43>The Anniston catcher was straddling home plate.</s>
<s snum=44>All Deegan had to do was slide, fall away, but instead, he rammed into the catcher.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=45>Both fell heavily to the ground.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=46>Only Mike got to his feet.</s>
<s snum=47>He went back to touch home plate, turned and walked to the dugout without looking back.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=48>The Anniston players and their manager ran out on the field.</s>
<s snum=49>They poured water over their catcher's face.</s>
<s snum=50>He did not move.</s>
<s snum=51>Then the manager called for a doctor.</s>
<s snum=52>The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer.</s>
<s snum=53>Then, quickly, and a little nervously, the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=54>Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench, watching.</s>
<s snum=55>When the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said: ``That ought to teach the sonofabitch''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=56>Phil Rossoff, seated next to Deegan, got up and moved to the other end of the bench.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=57>The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout.</s>
<s snum=58>He was followed by four of his men.</s>
<s snum=59>It began to look as if something was going to happen.</s>
<s snum=60>Mike sat quitely watching the manager come nearer.</s>
<s snum=61>Eddie Lee moved over to Mike Deegan's side.</s>
<s snum=62>No one said a word.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=63>The Anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of Mike.</s>
<s snum=64>His face was flushed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=65>``Deegan'', the manager said, his voice pitched low, quivering.</s>
<s snum=66>``That was a rotten thing to do''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=67>``For God's sake'', Mike said, waving the manager away.</s>
<s snum=68>``Stop it, will you?</s>
<s snum=69>Tell your guys not to block the plate''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=70>``You didn't have to ram him''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>``That's what you say''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=72>The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee.</s>
<s snum=73>It was a cold and calculated look.</s>
<s snum=74>He turned and went back across the field to his dugout.</s>
<s snum=75>He called in the pitcher who had been pitching, and a big, heavy, powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike Deegan came up to bat.</s>
<s snum=77>Everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>The first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for Mike's head.</s>
<s snum=79>Deegan fell into the dirt, the ball going over him.</s>
<s snum=80>He arose slowly and brushed himself off.</s>
<s snum=81>He got back into the batter's box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>``Hit the bum''! somebody yelled from the Anniston bench.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=83>In the Riverside dugout Frankie Ricco, shortstop, whispered into Phil's ear: ``There's gonna be a fight''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>``Look at those bastards''!</s>
<s snum=85>Charlie Haydon, a pitcher, said.</s>
<s snum=86>``They're looking for trouble''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=87>Mike was slow getting into the box this time.</s>
<s snum=88>When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=89>``Listen''! he shouted to the pitcher.</s>
<s snum=90>``One more and I'm coming out there''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=91>``I'll be waiting''! the pitcher yelled back.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=92>Mike Deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat.</s>
<s snum=93>He stood flat-footed in the box, but not very close to the plate now.</s>
<s snum=94>The pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for Mike's head.</s>
<s snum=95>Deegan dropped, got up, turned and, holding the bat with both hands up against his chest, began to walk slowly out to the mound.</s>
<s snum=96>The pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards Mike Deegan.</s>
<s snum=97>They were both walking towards each other, unhurried.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=98>Riverside and Anniston players rushed out on the field.</s>
<s snum=99>In the next moment, it seemed, the infield was crowded with spectators, ballplayers, cops, kids and a dog.</s>
<s snum=100>There was much shouting and screaming.</s>
<s snum=101>Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched.</s>
<s snum=102>Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=103>Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=104>After the game, Phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=105>``It's a helluva thing'', Mike said, looking at Phil, ``when a guy's own team-mate won't come out and help him in a fight''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=106>Phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head.</s>
<s snum=107>Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near Phil.</s>
<s snum=108>The other players were undressing quietly.</s>
<s snum=109>Eddie Lee had not come in yet.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=110>Mike went over to Phil and stood over him.</s>
<s snum=111>``Why the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=112>``I didn't think it was necessary''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=113>``Well!</s>
<s snum=114>Now that's just fine!</s>
<s snum=115>You didn't think it was necessary''.</s>
<s snum=116>Mike placed both his hands on his hips.</s>
<s snum=117>He pushed his jaw forward.</s>
<s snum=118>``Listen, wise guy, if you think I'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you're crazy''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=119>Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=120>``I didn't ask you to fight for the ball club'', Phil said slowly.</s>
<s snum=121>``Nobody else did, either''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=122>``You trying to say I started the fight''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=123>``I'm not trying to say anything''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=124>Phil turned away and opened his locker, and then he heard Mike Deegan say: ``You're yellow, Rossoff''!</s>
<s snum=125>and Phil banged his locker door shut and spun around.</s>
<s snum=126>But before anything could happen Frankie Ricco was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=127>``Phil, come into my office'', Eddie said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=128>Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door.</s>
<s snum=129>He sat down before Eddie's desk.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=130>``I'm doing you a favor'', Eddie said quickly.</s>
<s snum=131>``You get your unconditional release as of today''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=132>Phil's eyes widened just a trifle.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=133>``The best thing for you to do'', Eddie said, ``is go home.</s>
<s snum=134>You don't belong in professional baseball''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=135>Phil had to clear his throat.</s>
<s snum=136>``Is this because of what happened out there''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=137>``No'', Eddie said.</s>
<s snum=138>``But it does confirm what I've suspected all along''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=139>Phil stood up.</s>
<s snum=140>``Listen!</s>
<s snum=141>This is the second time''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=142>``Sit down, sit down'', Eddie said.</s>
<s snum=143>``I'm not saying you're yellow.</s>
<s snum=144>I am saying you're not a professional ballplayer''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=145>Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk.</s>
<s snum=146>``Now listen to me, Phil.</s>
<s snum=147>I'm not steering you wrong.</s>
<s snum=148>You haven't got the heart for baseball''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=149>Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned.</s>
<s snum=150>Suddenly his voice grew hard.</s>
<s snum=151>``What the hell do you think baseball is?</s>
<s snum=152>You're not in the big leagues, but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=153>Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short.</s>
<s snum=154>``Now don't tell me what a good ball player you are.</s>
<s snum=155>I know you've got talent.</s>
<s snum=156>But what you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with.</s>
<s snum=157>The heart, Phil.</s>
<s snum=158>You just haven't got the heart for pro-ball, and that's it''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=159>Dazed, Phil said: ``I don't get it.</s>
<s snum=160>My batting average &&&''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=161>Eddie stood up abruptly, then sat down just as abruptly.</s>
<s snum=162>``What difference does your batting average make?</s>
<s snum=163>Or your fielding average.</s>
<s snum=164>Or even the way you run bases.</s>
<s snum=165>I tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win- you won't do it.</s>
<s snum=166>That's what I mean by no heart for the game.</s>
<s snum=167>Baseball's no cinch.</s>
<s snum=168>Deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there.</s>
<s snum=169>He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on.</s>
<s snum=170>What the hell do you think baseball is?</s>
<s snum=171>A sport?</s>
<s snum=172>It's a way of life, goddamit!</s>
<s snum=173>And you've got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who want to take your way of life away from you''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=174>He's wrong!</s>
<s snum=175>Phil thought.</s>
<s snum=176>It's only his opinion.</s>
<s snum=177>There were other clubs in this league.</s>
<s snum=178>He stood up slowly.</s>
<s snum=179>He was a little pale and shaky.</s>
<s snum=180>His lips felt glued together.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=181>``I think you're wrong, Eddie'', he said finally.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=182>Eddie nodded.</s>
<s snum=183>``Okay.</s>
<s snum=184>You'll get your pay in the morning''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=185>Phil turned and left the room, hearing Eddie say:</s>
<s snum=186>``Someday you'll see I was right''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=187>Phil shut the door behind him.</s>
<s snum=188>Outside in the dressing room, Frankie Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=189>``What happened''?</s>
<s snum=190>Frankie asked.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=191>Phil said: ``I got my release''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=192>``You crazy''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=193>Phil shrugged.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=194>``What for''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=195>Phil sighed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=196>Frankie shook his head.</s>
<s snum=197>``I don't get it''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=198>``I don't know'', Phil said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=199>They were silent for a few moments.</s>
<s snum=200>Then Frankie said: ``What are you gonna do''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=201>Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again.</s>
<s snum=202>Phil took off one shoe and stared at it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=203>``Don't take it like this'', Frankie said.</s>
<s snum=204>``Hell, plenty of guys get let out and come back later.</s>
<s snum=205>The leagues are full of guys like that''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=206>Phil was very quiet.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=207>``What are you gonna do, Phil''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=208>Phil did not answer.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=209>``Why not try another club''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=210>Phil looked up.</s>
<s snum=211>What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=212>``Springfield's in tomorrow'', Frankie said.</s>
<s snum=213>``Talk to Whitey Jackson''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=214>He just didn't know what he was talking about, saying a thing like that.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=215>``Will you do it, Phil''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=216>``Do what''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=217>``Ask Whitey for a job''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=218>Phil nodded.</s>
<s snum=219>``Sure'', he said.</s>
<s snum=220>``Springfield come in tomorrow''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=221>Frankie nodded.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=222>``I'll speak to Whitey''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=223>``Atta boy''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=224>``I'll talk to him, all right''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=225>``Don't worry'', Frankie said.</s>
<s snum=226>``You'll get a job there.</s>
<s snum=227>He needs outfielders bad''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=228>``I'm not worried about it'', Phil said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=229>``That's the way to talk.</s>
<s snum=230>What else did Eddie have to say''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=231>``Nothing'', Phil said.</s>
