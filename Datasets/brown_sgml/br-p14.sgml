<p>
<s snum=1>She was moving through a screen of hemlocks, in among the white birch and maples.</s>
<s snum=2>The sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her ears.</s>
<s snum=3>She stood, once more listening.</s>
<s snum=4>She had never been here at this hour.</s>
<s snum=5>She felt as if some dark, totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm; but she found the path she always used, the stubs of branches she had broken, those she had pushed aside; and she walked easily now, and more slowly, until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=6>If I ever committed suicide, she thought, I would dive straight down from here- and no one would find me for days.</s>
<s snum=7>She smiled, and expertly let herself downward, holding this known root or that, her sneakers sliding in the leaves.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=8>She jumped out onto the flat expanse of rock and, seating herself, shook her short-cut brown hair and tilted her chin far upward.</s>
<s snum=9>The reedy music of the frogs had faded, but presently it began again, growing in volume until it was vibrant.</s>
<s snum=10>Julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped her hands tightly around the bent knees.</s>
<s snum=11>She had accomplished a miracle.</s>
<s snum=12>This was her place.</s>
<s snum=13>The hour couldn't change it.</s>
<s snum=14>Only- only- her thoughts were a little strange.</s>
<s snum=15>They were becoming confused.</s>
<s snum=16>Perhaps it was because it was so late, and because she had no business to be here now.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=17>She was thinking of Paul a few weeks ago, in the Easter holidays, with her at one of those awful Friday Evening Dancing Class parties her mother had made her attend.</s>
<s snum=18>``Hello, Julie, how are you''?</s>
<s snum=19>And then off he went so casually, to someone else with breasts better developed, more obvious in a lower-cut dress, someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him.</s>
<s snum=20>I wish he was with me now, she thought, and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only pretense and acute embarrassment.</s>
<s snum=21>Oh God!</s>
<s snum=22>I wish I were older or younger, Julia Bentley thought.</s>
<s snum=23>I wish so much someone loved me.</s>
</p>
<hl>CHAPTER 7</hl>
<p>
<s snum=24>George Rawlings remembered seeing the door open sometime during the night- Millie, in a white robe, standing like a ghost at the threshold.</s>
<s snum=25>She had vanished; he must have slept again.</s>
<s snum=26>He was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him.</s>
<s snum=27>It seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch; but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this Monday morning.</s>
<s snum=28>This room was like a prison.</s>
<s snum=29>He would not be indebted to Sam!</s>
<s snum=30>Below him, as if at the end of some remote tunnel, he heard the humming of a vacuum cleaner.</s>
<s snum=31>His fingers fumbled across the bandages.</s>
<s snum=32>They had left both of his eyes uncovered.</s>
<s snum=33>Well, he told himself, let's put the show on the road.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=34>He was walking across to the bathroom.</s>
<s snum=35>He drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands.</s>
<s snum=36>A fearful pain had come from his head, as if the water were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding them.</s>
<s snum=37>He recognized his jacket and trousers.</s>
<s snum=38>The fabric was dark; the stains weren't too apparent; and there were his shoes, thank God, but his shirt was one terrible mess.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=39>He shivered, and then tore away the blood-soaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf.</s>
<s snum=40>Sam would be amazed to find him gone.</s>
<s snum=41>Millie would have to understand.</s>
<s snum=42>She must have put his clothes in the closet.</s>
<s snum=43>He found a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness.</s>
<s snum=44>He was on the verge of tears.</s>
<s snum=45>Alex Poldowski- in a fashion he owed a debt to that effete gentleman.</s>
<s snum=46>At least Alex had told him he wasn't dying.</s>
<s snum=47>Perhaps George Rawlings would be better off dead.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=48>What time was it?</s>
<s snum=49>He peered at his wristwatch.</s>
<s snum=50>Strange, it was still running.</s>
<s snum=51>A quarter to seven.</s>
<s snum=52>Too early for a vacuum cleaner, but probably Sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs.</s>
<s snum=53>He was kneeling to tie his shoelaces.</s>
<s snum=54>His fingers felt absurdly thick and clumsy.</s>
<s snum=55>He rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door.</s>
<s snum=56>He barely knew himself.</s>
<s snum=57>This was some freak, two strands of adhesive tape across his nose, like ugly roots from the mass of gauze, suddenly moist over his cheekbones.</s>
<s snum=58>The surface, however, was perfectly white.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=59>He was drinking another glass of water.</s>
<s snum=60>It was after seven o'clock.</s>
<s snum=61>He was supposed to be in court this afternoon, at City Hall.</s>
<s snum=62>Who would take over?</s>
<s snum=63>He'd have to think, but the main thing, the imperative necessity, was to leave before Sam Bentley was up and about, and before Millie detained him with sympathy.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>He entered the hallway.</s>
<s snum=65>He was actually walking down the stairs.</s>
<s snum=66>A plane up in the sky, above the clouds, and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying to get away.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=67>``Father, is that you''?</s>
<s snum=68>The voice issued from the cavern of the hall below.</s>
<s snum=69>George did not reply.</s>
<s snum=70>``Is that you, Father?</s>
<s snum=71>Who's there''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=72>For a moment he felt like a thief discovered.</s>
<s snum=73>Then Julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining room.</s>
<s snum=74>She stood gazing at him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>``Uncle George''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>He was trying to smile at her.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=77>``Gosh!</s>
<s snum=78>You shouldn't be up, should you''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=79>``I- I was just leaving here, Julie.</s>
<s snum=80>I'm all set.</s>
<s snum=81>Just about to call a taxi''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>She was wearing some sort of gray blazer.</s>
<s snum=83>She seemed overly tall, her brow knitted in concern.</s>
<s snum=84>``Well, at least you won't have to do that'', she was saying.</s>
<s snum=85>``I'm about to leave myself.</s>
<s snum=86>I'll drop you off''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=87>``You're leaving''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=88>``I'm going back to school'', she answered.</s>
<s snum=89>``Pietro's driving me.</s>
<s snum=90>I'm just finishing breakfast.</s>
<s snum=91>But have you told Mother you were going''? she asked him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=92>``No.</s>
<s snum=93>I just don't want anyone disturbed, Julie.</s>
<s snum=94>That's my wish.</s>
<s snum=95>It's quite a big one'', he added.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=96>Her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight.</s>
<s snum=97>``Well, won't you come in then, have a cup of coffee- or something?</s>
<s snum=98>Or maybe a drink''?</s>
<s snum=99>she asked, in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated, considerate, and yet perhaps partly scornful.</s>
<s snum=100>He tried to see her face more clearly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=101>``No- nothing at all'', he said after a moment's hesitation.</s>
<s snum=102>``I'll just wait for you here''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=103>He leaned his head against the wood paneling behind him, but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids.</s>
<s snum=104>He raised them.</s>
<s snum=105>Julia moved past.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=106>``I have to say good-by upstairs.</s>
<s snum=107>I won't be long''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=108>``As a great favor, Julie'', he said, ``please don't mention you've seen me''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=109>``Not to anyone''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=110>``No- please.</s>
<s snum=111>''I'll call your mother as soon as I get home.</s>
<s snum=112>It'll be so much easier``.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=113>``All right'' She was staring at him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=114>``I'm fine, Julie.</s>
<s snum=115>Please, you just go ahead''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=116>She had disappeared.</s>
<s snum=117>He could feel a pulse pounding against the bandages.</s>
<s snum=118>He imagined Sam's voice: ``George, what the hell goes on''?</s>
<s snum=119>I wouldn't have the strength to answer, he thought.</s>
<s snum=120>Maybe I couldn't have called a taxi.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=121>He could hear the footsteps overhead.</s>
<s snum=122>He saw the suitcase, which Julia was holding.</s>
<s snum=123>He stood up.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=124>``I'll take that, Julie- for you''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=125>``Oh no'', she said.</s>
<s snum=126>``I can manage''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=127>She went ahead of him.</s>
<s snum=128>Outside the Lincoln was parked.</s>
<s snum=129>He could hardly believe he was getting in.</s>
<s snum=130>Pietro was gazing at him in an insolent, disdainful fashion; but that didn't matter.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=131>We'll drop Mr. Rawlings off in Ardmore``, Julia said, and for the merest second George was reminded of her father's tone with servants.</s>
<s snum=132>To the manner born- odd to have such a thought at a time like this; yet her inflection seemed forced or rehearsed.</s>
<s snum=133>He could not stop to analyze.</s>
<s snum=134>He had never felt particularly close to her.</s>
<s snum=135>Carrie seemed more affectionate, but obviously Julia had respected his request.</s>
<s snum=136>He took her hand.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=137>``I wish I didn't have to go back to school'', she said, and then, ``I wish you lived in New York.</s>
<s snum=138>That's in the opposite direction''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=139>``I wish I did'', he responded.</s>
<s snum=140>``I wish I wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume, and that we could go to a theater together, or a nice restaurant, forget we knew''.</s>
<s snum=141>He stopped speaking.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=142>``Forget we ever knew what''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=143>``Oh, just sort of everything in general''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=144>She said nothing until Pietro had slackened their pace.</s>
<s snum=145>``I know you feel badly, but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=146>``Does it''? he asked.</s>
<s snum=147>``Yes, perhaps.</s>
<s snum=148>I'm supposed to joke about things, aren't I?</s>
<s snum=149>But sometimes life can be rather a disappointing business''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=150>His voice seemed thick and purposeless.</s>
<s snum=151>He relinquished her hand.</s>
<s snum=152>He could see the stone building where he lived.</s>
<s snum=153>Just a few more steps.</s>
<s snum=154>Abruptly he reached into his pocket.</s>
<s snum=155>Yes, there was the key.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=156>``Are you positive you'll be all right by yourself''?</s>
<s snum=157>she asked him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=158>For a moment he smiled.</s>
<s snum=159>``Yes, Julie dear.</s>
<s snum=160>You've done me the greatest possible service.</s>
<s snum=161>By myself I'll be fine''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=162>``Take care of yourself then''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=163>``I will.</s>
<s snum=164>You, also.</s>
<s snum=165>Don't work too hard''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=166>It was an automatic phrase; as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it.</s>
<s snum=167>He should have discovered a more tender farewell.</s>
<s snum=168>Someone shouted at him, ``Well!</s>
<s snum=169>Will you look at George Rawlings!</s>
<s snum=170>What happened to you''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=171>``I bumped into a door handle'', George said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=172>Someone laughed.</s>
<s snum=173>George walked steadily ahead into his entry.</s>
<s snum=174>His bandages seemed on fire.</s>
<s snum=175>He had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it.</s>
<s snum=176>In the kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp.</s>
<s snum=177>Just one or two swallows, he told himself, enough to lessen some of the pain.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=178>He was telephoning.</s>
<s snum=179>``No, Millie, I'm home.</s>
<s snum=180>No, really, right as rain.</s>
<s snum=181>Tell Sam not to worry about the car.</s>
<s snum=182>I'll get it hauled away.</s>
<s snum=183>No, please- no visit today- I'll be aslee.</s>
<s snum=184>For God's sake, don't worry.</s>
<s snum=185>That upsets me more than anything.</s>
<s snum=186>Yes, sure, I'll see the doctor- this evening, if you insist''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=187>There was one more call to make.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=188>``Joan, did I wake you''? he asked.</s>
<s snum=189>``Yes, I thought you'd probably be up.</s>
<s snum=190>Look, sweetheart, some fool was &&& happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated last night.</s>
<s snum=191>Unfortunately it turned out to be me, but I wouldn't quite put it that way to the boss.</s>
<s snum=192>Oh hell no, I'm not in a hospital.</s>
<s snum=193>I won't be in town for a couple of days, though, and there's that case I was supposed to handle this afternoon.</s>
<s snum=194>Too bad a jury isn't involved.</s>
<s snum=195>I might struggle in for a jury.</s>
<s snum=196>I'd win hands down.</s>
<s snum=197>But I thought maybe Tony Elliott could pinch-hit for me.</s>
<s snum=198>He'll understand- you might give him sort of a tactful nudge.</s>
<s snum=199>He's got all the facts.</s>
<s snum=200>I wouldn't want to ask for a postponement- it's really just a routine thing.</s>
<s snum=201>What?</s>
<s snum=202>No, darling I'd rather you didn't come out''.</s>
<s snum=203>A smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape.</s>
<s snum=204>``Don't even send flowers.</s>
<s snum=205>I'll see you Wednesday.</s>
<s snum=206>I'll bribe you with a nice-''.</s>
<s snum=207>He was about to say ``double martini'' but thought better of it.</s>
<s snum=208>``I'll take you out to dinner.</s>
<s snum=209>Okay''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=210>He had put down the receiver.</s>
<s snum=211>A strange relationship between Joan Fulbright and himself.</s>
<s snum=212>Who knew about it?</s>
<s snum=213>She lived alone in the older part of the city, in one of those renovated houses whose brick facade some early settler had constructed.</s>
<s snum=214>She had two tiny rooms on the second floor.</s>
<s snum=215>She was a clever girl, a most efficient secretary.</s>
<s snum=216>She let him come and go as he pleased, or as it pleased her.</s>
<s snum=217>In the office you might have thought them only casual friends; yet if he said: Make an excuse yourself, come out here today, she would have been on the next train- and, similarly, if she had been in need, he would have gone to her.</s>
