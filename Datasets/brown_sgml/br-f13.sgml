<s snum=1>Farming is confining.</s>
<s snum=2>The farmer's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=3>Livestock must be tended every day, routinely.</s>
<s snum=4>A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=5>Even if there are no livestock, the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods, particularly during the growing season.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=6>The worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily.</s>
<s snum=7>He cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice; such a move may mean a loss of capital.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=8>Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of farm life.</s>
<s snum=9>The farmer must get up early, and, at times, work late at night.</s>
<s snum=10>Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain.</s>
<s snum=11>No matter how well work is planned, bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=13>Production may fall far below expectations.</s>
<s snum=14>Drought, hail, disease, and insects take their toll of crops.</s>
<s snum=15>Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner's earnings, even into his capital.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=16>Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=17>The high cost of land, supplies, and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis.</s>
<s snum=18>Land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price, higher if it has subdivision possibilities.</s>
<s snum=19>Part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities.</s>
<s snum=20>If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high, farm labor costs will also be high.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=21>A part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen, per cow, or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer.</s>
<s snum=22>It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment.</s>
<s snum=23>He may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations, such as spraying or threshing, and for these, he may have to wait his turn.</s>
<s snum=24>There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=25>The farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost.</s>
<s snum=26>This may be true whether the farm is owned or rented.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=27>If the farm is rented, the rent must be paid.</s>
<s snum=28>If it is owned, taxes must be paid, and if the place is not free of mortgage, there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of.</s>
</p>
<hl>ADVANTAGES</hl>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=29>A farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children.</s>
<s snum=30>It gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air.</s>
<s snum=31>The children can do chores adapted to their age and ability.</s>
<s snum=32>Caring for a calf, a pig, or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=33>Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost, provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=34>For some retired persons, part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income.</s>
<s snum=35>It is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=36>Generally, the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city.</s>
<s snum=37>The savings are not as great, however, as is sometime supposed.</s>
<s snum=38>Usually, the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more.</s>
<s snum=39>Where schools, fire and police protection, and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country, real estate taxes are usually about the same.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=40>A part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=41>Some persons consider the work on a farm recreational.</s>
<s snum=42>For some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job, and a physical conditioner.</s>
</p>
<hl>LAND, LABOR, AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED</hl>
<p>
<s snum=43>Part-time farming can take comparatively little land, labor, and equipment- or a great deal.</s>
<s snum=44>It depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=45>General requirements for land, labor, and equipment are discussed below.</s>
<s snum=46>Specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14.</s>
</p>
<hl>LAND</hl>
<p>
<s snum=47>Three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use, and for a small flock of chickens, a cow, and two pigs.</s>
<s snum=48>You could not, of course, raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>If you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale, you'll need more land.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=50>In deciding how much land you want, take into account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect.</s>
<s snum=51>But consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work.</s>
<s snum=52>The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision.</s>
<s snum=53>Some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development.</s>
<s snum=54>This is a highly speculative venture.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=55>Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract.</s>
<s snum=56>When surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up, it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm.</s>
</p>
<hl>LABOR</hl>
<p>
<s snum=57>If you have a year-round, full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your family uses- unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help.</s>
<s snum=58>As a rule, part-time farmers hire little help.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=59>In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor, compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=60>List the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month.</s>
<s snum=61>You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one.</s>
<s snum=62>Do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare time- only what you are willing to use for farm work.</s>
</p>
<hl>EQUIPMENT</hl>
<p>
<s snum=63>If you are going to produce for home use only, you will need only hand tools.</s>
<s snum=64>You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing, however.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=65>For larger plantings, you'll need some kind of power for plowing, harrowing, disking, and cultivating.</s>
<s snum=66>If you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor (available for $300to $500 with attachments, 1960 prices).</s>
<s snum=67>These tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing, particularly on heavier soils, so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer.</s>
<s snum=69>If you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=70>You can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery, by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor, and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs.</s>
<s snum=71>If an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed- such as a spray rig, a combine, or a binder- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work.</s>
</p>
<hl>SELECTING A FARM</hl>
<p>
<s snum=72>Before you look for a farm you'll need to know (1)the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake; and (2) whether you want to buy or rent.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=73>Information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=74>If you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate, or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming, usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>Discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm.</s>
</p>
<hl>LOCATION</hl>
<hl>NEARNESS TO WORK.-</hl>
<p>
<s snum=76>Choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities.</s>
<s snum=77>Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell the farm.</s>
<s snum=78>The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=79>Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road.</s>
</p>
<hl>NEARNESS TO MARKETS.-</hl>
<p>
<s snum=80>If you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby.</s>
<s snum=81>If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk, for example, you should be close to a town or city.</s>
</p>
<hl>KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD.-</hl>
<p>
<s snum=82>Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes.</s>
<s snum=83>There are slums in the country as well as in the city.</s>
<s snum=84>Few rural areas are protected by zoning.</s>
<s snum=85>A tavern, filling station, junk yard, rendering plant, or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value.</s>
</p>
<hl>FACILITIES IN THE AREA.-</hl>
<p>
<s snum=86>Check on the schools in the area, the quality of teaching, and the provision for transportation to and from them.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=87>Find out whether fire protection, sewage system, gas, water mains, and electrical lines are available in the locality.</s>
<s snum=88>If these facilities are not at the door, getting them may cost more than you expect.</s>
<s snum=89>You may have to provide them yourself or get along without them.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=90>You cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water.</s>
<s snum=91>If you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well, find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled.</s>
<s snum=92>A pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden.</s>
<s snum=93>Pond water can be filtered for human use, but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble.</s>
<s snum=94>The following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses.</s>
</p>
<hl>TOPOGRAPHY AND SOIL</hl>
<p>
<s snum=95>Is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise?</s>
<s snum=96>If you can't tell, get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist.</s>
<s snum=97>Soil type, drainage, or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones.</s>
<s snum=98>Small areas that aren't right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop.</s>
</p>
<hl>THE HOUSE</hl>
<p>
<s snum=99>Will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence?</s>
<s snum=100>How much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating?</s>
<s snum=101>If the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating system must be installed, check into the cost of making these improvements.</s>
</p>
<hl>BUYING A FARM</hl>
<hl>The value of the farm to you will depend on- @</hl>
<p>
<s snum=102>Its worth as a place to live.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=103>The value of the products you can raise on it.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=104>The possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=105>Decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town.</s>
<s snum=106>Take into account the difference in city and county taxes, insurance rates, utility rates, and the cost of travel to work.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=107>Next, estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm.</s>
<s snum=108>To do this, set up a plan on paper for operating the farm.</s>
<s snum=109>List the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year.</s>
<s snum=110>Estimate the value of the produce at normal prices.</s>
<s snum=111>The total is the probable gross income from farming.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=112>To find estimated net farm income, subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming.</s>
<s snum=113>Include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment.</s>
<s snum=114>Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family.</s>
<s snum=115>It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth, but charge something for it.</s>
<s snum=116>Otherwise, you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>To figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income, divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way.</s>
