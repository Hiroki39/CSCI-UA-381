<s snum=1>Harbor Point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck of a steamer clam.</s>
<s snum=2>It's a rich village but not much for action- too many solid residents, not enough tourists or working stiffs.</s>
<s snum=3>It's at the far end of the county and the last time I came here was for a hit and run manslaughter- about seven months ago.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=4>Chief Bob Moore looked his same hick-self; a man mountain running to lard in his middle-age.</s>
<s snum=5>Seeing me he said with real surprise, ``Well, well, ain't we honored!</s>
<s snum=6>Hardly expected the head of County Homicide up for this murder.</s>
<s snum=7>You sure climbed fast, Jed.</s>
<s snum=8>Rookie investigator last summer and now it's Inspector Jed.</s>
<s snum=9>Took me 19 years to become Chief of our three man police force.</s>
<s snum=10>Proves a college education pays off''.</s>
<s snum=11>His sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>``I guess it helps'', I said, paying no attention to his ribbing.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=13>``Never could figure out why you ever wanted to be a cop, Jed.</s>
<s snum=14>You're not only young but, well, you don't even look like a police officer.</s>
<s snum=15>A runt with narrow shoulders and that brush haircut, hell, you'd pass for a juvenile delinquent of the hotrod set.</s>
<s snum=16>In my day the first requirement for a cop was to look like the law, big and tough.</s>
<s snum=17>Man, when my 275 pounds and six-four comes along, why it's the same as another badge.</s>
<s snum=18>When I say move, a guy moves''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>``Don't worry about my being tough, Moore.</s>
<s snum=20>Also, it's far too early in the day for corny lines like the bigger they come.</s>
<s snum=21>You've had your gassy lecture, let's get to work.</s>
<s snum=22>Who was the murdered woman, Mrs.Buck''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=23>``Widow, nice sort of woman.</s>
<s snum=24>Comfortably fixed.</s>
<s snum=25>Ran a fair-sized farm.</s>
<s snum=26>Came to the Harbor as a bride and &&&.</s>
<s snum=27>Don't worry Jed, this one is in the bag.</s>
<s snum=28>I know the killer, have the only road off the peninsula covered''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=29>``Yeah, passed your road block as I drove in'', I said, sitting on his polished desk.</s>
<s snum=30>Although Bob dressed like a slob, he kept a neat office.</s>
<s snum=31>``Okay, what happened''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=32>``About nine this morning Mrs. Buck phones me she's having trouble with one of her farm hands- money trouble.</s>
<s snum=33>Colored fellow named Tim Williams- only hand she has working for her now.</s>
<s snum=34>Tim come with the migratory workers that follow the crops up from the South last year, but Tim and his wife settled here.</s>
<s snum=35>Never had no trouble with him before, thought he was a hard worker, hustling around to get a full week's work.</s>
<s snum=36>Anyway, Julia asks me to''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=37>``Julia''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=38>``Come on, Inspector, look alive.</s>
<s snum=39>Julia Buck, the deceased'', Moore said, slipping me his smug, idiot-grin again.</s>
<s snum=40>``Julia asks me to come out at once.</s>
<s snum=41>But she didn't sound real alarmed, you know, like there was any immediate danger.</s>
<s snum=42>I got there at 9:47 A.M., found her strangled.</s>
<s snum=43>I would have come sooner if I'd known.</s>
<s snum=44>No doubt about Tim being the killer- I have a witness.</s>
<s snum=45>Don't know why the County had to send anybody up here.</s>
<s snum=46>Told them I can handle this''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=47>``Yeah, seems you have a nice package, with all the strings tied.</s>
<s snum=48>Who's &&& ''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>``I'll collar Tim before night''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=50>``Who's your witness''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=51>``Julia had- has- an old Indian woman cooking for her- Nellie Harris.</s>
<s snum=52>Probably the last of the original Island Indians.</s>
<s snum=53>Nellie was in the kitchen, had just come to work, when she heard Tim arguing with Julia in the living room.</s>
<s snum=54>Swears she recognized his voice, that Tim yelled, 'It's my money and I want it'!</s>
<s snum=55>and then rushed out of the house.</s>
<s snum=56>Then she heard Julia phone me.</s>
<s snum=57>Nellie went on with her house work- until I found Julia dead.</s>
<s snum=58>And before you say it, Nellie ain't near strong enough to have strangled Julia.</s>
<s snum=59>There's no doubt this Tim sneaked back and killed Mrs. Buck.</s>
<s snum=60>Another fact: Tim's disappeared- on the run.</s>
<s snum=61>But there's no way off the Point except through my road block.</s>
<s snum=62>Guess you want to see the body- have her up the street in Doc Abel's office''.</s>
<s snum=63>``Let's see it''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>We walked up Main Street to this big white house, then around to the back.</s>
<s snum=65>Being the Harbors sole doctor, Abel was also its Medical Examiner.</s>
<s snum=66>The corpse was on a table, covered by a sheet.</s>
<s snum=67>Doc Abel was busy up front with some of his live patients.</s>
<s snum=68>Pulling back the sheet, I examined the bruises around Julia Buck's once slender throat.</s>
<s snum=69>Powerful hands had killed her.</s>
<s snum=70>``Find any prints''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>Chief Moore shook his big head, seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body.</s>
<s snum=72>Then he said, ``Never noticed it before.</s>
<s snum=73>I mean, when she was dressed &&& but for a woman her age, Julia had a real fine figure''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=74>I dropped the sheet, glanced at my watch.</s>
<s snum=75>It was almost one and I hadn't had lunch.</s>
<s snum=76>Still, I wanted to get this over with, had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office.</s>
<s snum=77>I told him, ``I want to go see the Buck house''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>``Sure''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=79>Walking back down Main Street, I said, ``I saw the Harbor's one squad car at the road block, we'll ride out in my car''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=80>``Naw, we'll use mine'', Moore said, opening the door of a sleek white Jaguar roadster.</s>
<s snum=81>As I slid in beside him he said, ``Some heap, hey?</s>
<s snum=82>Got a heck of a buy on this, dirt cheap''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=83>``Yeah, it's a real load'', I told him, looking up the street at my battered Ford.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>Five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical two-story house, and when the Jaguar stopped I managed to swallow.</s>
<s snum=85>There was a garage and a modern barn in the rear, all of it standing between two large flat fields planted in early potatoes.</s>
<s snum=86>Everything shouted gentleman farming, the kind of grandfather-father-to son folding money the Point is known for.</s>
<s snum=87>The fins of a Caddy were sticking out of the garage, while the inside of the house was a comfortable mixture of old and expensive contemporary furniture.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=88>Nellie Harris wasn't old, she was ancient- a tiny shriveled woman with a face like a tan prune.</s>
<s snum=89>She was also stone deaf in her right ear.</s>
<s snum=90>She calmly repeated what Moore had told me.</s>
<s snum=91>When I asked, ``Why didn't you go into the living room to see how Mrs. Buck was''?</s>
<s snum=92>the old gal stared at me with her hard eyes, said, ``She didn't call.</s>
<s snum=93>I do the living room last.</s>
<s snum=94>I went up stairs and did the bath and her bedroom- way I always do in the morning''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=95>``Have you any idea what this Tim and Mrs. Buck were arguing about''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=96>``Probably wages.</s>
<s snum=97>Miss Julia was a hard woman with a dollar.</s>
<s snum=98>Years ago when I asked her to put me in Social Security, so's I wouldn't have to be working now, Miss Julia threatened to fire me- all because it would mean a few more dollars a year to her''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=99>``Did you hear Tim return''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=100>``No sir.</s>
<s snum=101>Nobody came until Chief Moore''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=102>I drummed on the kitchen table with my pencil.</s>
<s snum=103>``Mrs.Buck have any men friends''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=104>``Her''?</s>
<s snum=105>The wrinkled mouth laughed, revealing astonishingly strong, white, teeth.</s>
<s snum=106>``I never see none.</s>
<s snum=107>But then I wasn't her social secretary''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=108>``Was she on friendly terms with other members of her family''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=109>``Didn't have no family- around here.</s>
<s snum=110>They had a son- killed in the war''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=111>I walked into the living room.</s>
<s snum=112>There didn't seem to be any signs of a struggle.</s>
<s snum=113>I told Moore, ``Where does Tim's wife live''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=114>``I'll take you there.</s>
<s snum=115>Look Jed, this is an open and shut case and I have to relieve my men at the road block soon.</s>
<s snum=116>Okay, come on''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>We did 80 miles an hour across a hard dirt road to a cluster of shacks.</s>
<s snum=118>In late summer migratory workers lived five and six to a room in these.</s>
<s snum=119>Now they were empty, except for a cottage across the road.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=120>Mrs. Tim Williams was about 21, with skin the color of bitter chocolate, and if you discounted the plain dress and worn slippers, she was startlingly pretty.</s>
<s snum=121>The inside of their place was full of new furniture, five bucks down and a buck a week stuff, but all of it clean and full of the warmth of a home.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=122>Mrs. Williams was both sullen and frightened.</s>
<s snum=123>She said she didn't know a thing- Tim had left the house at six in the morning, as usual.</s>
<s snum=124>She hadn't seen him since.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=125>``Did Mrs. Buck owe him any wages''?</s>
<s snum=126>I asked.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=127>``Well, for this week, but they wasn't due 'till Saturday.</s>
<s snum=128>Listen, Mr. Inspector, no matter what anybody say, my Tim didn't kill that woman!</s>
<s snum=129>Tim is a good man, hard working.</s>
<s snum=130>He strong as a bull but gentle as a baby.</s>
<s snum=131>Even if he angry, Tim wouldn't hurt a woman.</s>
<s snum=132>He never in his life took a hand to a woman or &&&''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=133>``We'll get him soon, see what he says'', Chief Moore cut in.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=134>``Does your husband have a car''?</s>
<s snum=135>I asked.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=136>``Got us an old station wagon.</s>
<s snum=137>Need it for the job''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=138>I asked a silly question: ``You've no idea where your husband could be, now''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=139>She shook her head.</s>
<s snum=140>I knew she was lying.</s>
<s snum=141>I stood there, staring at her for a moment- thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=142>Moore said, ``Come on, Jed, I have to get to my men''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=143>On my way out I told her, ``If you should, eh, just happen to see your husband, get him to give himself up.</s>
<s snum=144>He'll get a fair trial.</s>
<s snum=145>Hiding out like this won't get him anything, except more trouble, or a bullet''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=146>``Yes.</s>
<s snum=147>I'll tell him- if I see him''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=148>We made it back to the Harbor in less than four minutes.</s>
<s snum=149>I tried not to act scared.</s>
<s snum=150>That Jaguar could really barrel along.</s>
<s snum=151>I told Moore I was going to eat, get some forms filled out by Doc Abel.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=152>Chief Moore said, ``If I don't see you when I return, see you for certain at my road block, Inspector''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=153>I had a bowl of decent chowder, phoned the Doc and he said he'd leave the death statements with his girl- in a half hour.</s>
<s snum=154>Lighting my pipe, I took a walk.</s>
<s snum=155>The Harbor is a big yachting basin in the summer.</s>
<s snum=156>Even now, there were several slick cruisers tied to the dock, an ocean-going yawl anchored inside the breakwater.</s>
<s snum=157>There was a 34 foot Wheeler with CHIEF BOB'S in big gold letters on its stern also tied up at the dock.</s>
<s snum=158>It wasn't a new boat, about five years old, but fitted with fishing outriggers and chairs.</s>
<s snum=159>I asked an old guy running a fishing station if the boat was Moore's.</s>
<s snum=160>He said, ``You bet.</s>
<s snum=161>Bob Moore is plumb crazy about blue fishing''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=162>I dropped into the doctor's office, picked up my forms.</s>
<s snum=163>As I was walking back to the Police Station, which was in the same building with the City Hall and Post Office, I saw Mrs. Tim Williams sneaking into the back of my car.</s>
<s snum=164>If she moved gracefully, she was clumsy at it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=165>I got into the front seat.</s>
<s snum=166>She was 'hiding' on the floor of the back seat, the soft curves of her back and hips- rousing lines.</s>
<s snum=167>I drove out of the Harbor, turned off into a dirt road among the scrub pine trees and stopped.</s>
<s snum=168>I waited a few minutes and she sat up.</s>
<s snum=169>For another moment we didn't talk, then she began to weep.</s>
<s snum=170>She mumbled, ``I just know that Chief Moore is out to kill my Tim''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=171>``Maybe.</s>
<s snum=172>I never saw him so anxious before'', I said, lighting my pipe and offering her a cigarette.</s>
<s snum=173>``Of course, it could be because this is his first murder case.</s>
<s snum=174>You know where Tim is, don't you, Mrs. Williams''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=175>She puffed on the cigarette slowly, sitting slumped against the back seat; didn't answer.</s>
