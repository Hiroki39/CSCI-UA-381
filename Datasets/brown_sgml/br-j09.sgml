<s snum=1>A variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation and study of blood group antibodies.</s>
<s snum=2>These include low-temperature ethanol (Cohn) fractionation, electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses.</s>
<s snum=3>Modifications of the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators.</s>
<s snum=4>Abelson and Rawson, using a stepwise elution scheme, fractionated whole sera containing ~ABO and ~Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl ~DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose.</s>
<s snum=5>Speer and coworkers, in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera, used a series of gradients for elution from ~DEAE-cellulose.</s>
<s snum=6>Fahey and Morrison used a single, continuous gradient at constant ~pH for the fractionation of anti-~A and anti-~B agglutinins from preisolated ~|g-globulin samples.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>In the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on ~DEAE-cellulose using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson, and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ~ABO and ~Rh systems have been described.</s>
</p>
<hl>MATERIALS AND METHODS</hl>
<hl>SAMPLES.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=8>Serum samples were obtained from normal group ~A, group ~B and group ~O donors.</s>
<s snum=9>Three of the anti-~Rh sera used were taken from recently sensitized individuals.</s>
<s snum=10>One contained complete antibody and had a titer of 1:512 in saline.</s>
<s snum=11>The second contained incomplete antibody and showed titers of 1:256 in albumin and 1:2048 by the indirect Coombs test.</s>
<s snum=12>The third, containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies, had titers of 1:256 in saline, 1:512 in albumin and 1:1024by the indirect Coombs test.</s>
<s snum=13>In addition one serum was obtained from a donor (R. E.) who had been sensitized 6 years previously.</s>
<s snum=14>This serum exhibited titers of 1:16 in albumin and 1:256 by the indirect Coombs test.</s>
<s snum=15>These antibody titers were determined by reaction with homozygous **f red cells.</s>
</p>
<hl>SEROLOGICAL TECHNIQUE.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=16>Anti-~A and anti-~B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group ~A, group ~B or group ~O donors by the following tube agglutination methods.</s>
<s snum=17>One drop of each sample was added to one drop of a 2% suspension of group **f or group ~B red cells in a small **f test tube.</s>
<s snum=18>In several instances group ~O cells were also used as controls.</s>
<s snum=19>The red cells were used within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline before use.</s>
<s snum=20>The mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 ~hr.</s>
<s snum=21>the tubes were then centrifuged at 1000 ~rpm for 1 ~min and examined macroscopically for agglutination.</s>
<s snum=22>For the albumin method, equal volumes of 30% bovine albumin, sample and 2% cells suspended in saline were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 ~hr and then were centrifuged at 1000 ~rpm for 1 ~min.</s>
<s snum=23>All samples were tested by both the saline and albumin methods.</s>
<s snum=24>The activities of fractions of sera containing ~Rh antibodies were tested by the saline, albumin and indirect Coombs techniques.</s>
<s snum=25>Homozygous and heterozygous **f cells, **f and homozygous and heterozygous **f cells were used to test each sample; however, in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with homozygous **f and homozygous **f cells will be presented here.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>The saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the ~ABO samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 ~hr at 37`~C before centrifugation.</s>
<s snum=27>The saline tubes were saved and used for the indirect Coombs test in the following manner.</s>
<s snum=28>The cells were washed three times with saline, anti-human serum was added, the cells were resuspended, and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 ~rpm for 1 ~min and examined for agglutination.</s>
<s snum=29>The anti-human sera used were prepared by injecting whole human serum into rabbits.</s>
<s snum=30>Those antisera shown by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the ``broad spectrum'' type were selected for used in the present study.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=31>The red cells for the ~Rh antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the **f cells, which had been glycerolized and stored at -20`~C for approximately 1 year.</s>
<s snum=32>These cells were thawed at 37`~C for 30 ~min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions (20, 18, 10, 8, 4 and 2%).</s>
<s snum=33>The cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended to 2% in saline.</s>
</p>
<hl>CHROMATOGRAPHY.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=34>Blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 ~hr, centrifuged and the serum was removed.</s>
<s snum=35>The serum was measured volumetrically and subsequently dialyzed in the cold for at least 24 ~hr against three to four changes, approximately 750 ~ml each, of ``starting buffer''.</s>
<s snum=36>This buffer, ~pH 8.6, was 0.005 ~M in **f and 0.039 ~M in tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane (Tris).</s>
<s snum=37>After dialysis the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant placed on a **f ~cm column of ~EEAE-cellulose equilibrated with starting buffer.</s>
<s snum=38>The ~DEAE-cellulose, containing 0.78 ~mEq of ~N/g, was prepared in our laboratory by the method of Peterson and Sober (7) from powdered cellulose, 100-230 mesh.</s>
<s snum=39>The small amount of insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ~ml of starting buffer, centrifuged, resuspended in 2.5 ~ml of isotonic saline and tested for antibody activity.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=40>The chromatography was done at 6`~C using gradient elution, essentially according to Sober and Peterson.</s>
<s snum=41>The deep concave gradient employed (fig. 2) was obtained with a nine-chambered gradient elution device (``Varigrad'', reference (8)) and has been described elsewhere.</s>
<s snum=42>the other, a shallow concave gradient (Fig. 1), was produced with a so-called ``cone-sphere'' apparatus, the ``cone'' being a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask and the ``sphere,'' a 2-liter round-bottom flask.</s>
<s snum=43>Each initially contained 1700 ~ml of buffer; in the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer, 0.50 ~M in both **f and Tris, ~pH 4.1.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=44>A flow rate of 72 **f was used and 12 ~ml fractions were collected.</s>
<s snum=45>Approximately 165 fractions were obtained from each column.</s>
<s snum=46>These were read at 280 ~m|m in a Beckman model ~DU spectrophotometer and tested for antibody activity as described above.</s>
</p>
<hl>PAPER ELECTROPHORESIS.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=47>For protein identification, fractions from the column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5`~C or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline.</s>
<s snum=48>During the latter procedure the temperature was maintained at 2`~C by surrounding the apparatus with ice.</s>
<s snum=49>Because negative pressure dialysis gave better recovery of proteins, permitted detection of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler procedure, it was used in all but the earliest experiments.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=50>Paper electrophoresis was carried out on the concentrated samples in a Spinco model ~R cell using barbital buffer, ~pH 8.6, ionic strength 0.075, at room temperature on Whatman ~3MM filter paper.</s>
<s snum=51>Five milliamperes/cell were applied for 18 ~hr, after which the strips were stained with bromphenol blue and densitometry was carried out using a Spinco Analytrol.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>When paper electrophoresis was to be used for preparation, eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run/chamber under the conditions described above.</s>
<s snum=53>At the end of the run, the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried, stained for 1 ~hr, washed and dried, while the other strips were maintained in a horizontal position at 1`~C.</s>
<s snum=54>The unstained strips were then marked, using the stained ones as a guide, and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein bands.</s>
<s snum=55>The strip sections containing a given protein were pooled, eluted with 0.5 ~ml of isotonic saline, and the eluates were tested for antibody activity.</s>
</p>
<hl>ULTRACENTRIFUGATION.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=56>Fractions from the column which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 ~hr in the cold against at least 500 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, ~pH 7.2, ionic strength 0.154.</s>
<s snum=57>They were then centrifuged at 59,780 ~rpm for 35 to 80 ~min at 20`~C in a Spinco model ~E ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 1.00 to 1.25%.</s>
<s snum=58>Sedimentation coefficients were computed as **f values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated from the Schlieren patterns.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=59>For preparative ultracentrifugation, fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ~ml or less, transferred to cellulose tubes and diluted to 12 ~ml with isotonic saline.</s>
<s snum=60>Ultracentrifugation was then carried out in a Spinco model ~L ultracentrifuge at 40,000 ~rpm for 125 to 150 ~min, refrigeration being used throughout the run.</s>
<s snum=61>Successive 1-~ml fractions were then drawn off with a hypodermic syringe, starting at the top of the tube, and tested for agglutinin activity.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=62>Other methods will be described below.</s>
</p>
<hl>EXPERIMENTAL AND RESULTS</hl>
<p>
<s snum=63>The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity, regardless of the blood group of the donor.</s>
<s snum=64>With either of the gradients described, chromatography on ~DEAE-cellulose separated agglutinins of the ~ABO series into at least three regions (Figs. 1 and 2):</s>
<s snum=65>one of extremely low anionic binding capacity, one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding capacity.</s>
<s snum=66>These have been labeled Regions 1, 2, and 4, respectively, in Fig. 1.</s>
<s snum=67>When the early part of the gradient was flattened, either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the ``cone-sphere'' gradient to become established more slowly, Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas (donors P. J. and R. S., Fig. 1 and E. M., Fig. 2).</s>
<s snum=68>The latter procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak (Region 1a) between Regions 1 and 2.</s>
<s snum=69>In 2 of 15experiments on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected (Region 3, Fig. 1).</s>
<s snum=70>Moreover, after concentration using negative pressure dialysis, agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected in the region designated 2a (donors P. J., D. A., and J. F., Fig. 1).</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>Not all these regions exhibited equal agglutinating activity, as evidenced by titer and the extent of the active areas.</s>
<s snum=72>In all cases, most of the activity lay in the region of high anionic binding capacity.</s>
<s snum=73>This was particularly noticeable in group ~A and group ~B sera, in which cases activity in Regions 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at all.</s>
<s snum=74>There appeared to be no difference in the distribution of anti-~A and anti-~B activity in group ~O serum, though in two group ~O donors (J. F. and E. M.) only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic binding capacity (Figs. 1 and 2).</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>Several samples of citrated plasma were fractionated in our laboratory by Method 6 of Cohn et al..</s>
<s snum=76>These fractions were tested for ~ABO agglutinin activity, using fractions from group ~AB plasma as a control.</s>
<s snum=77>As expected, most of the activity was found in Fraction **f, with slight activity seen in Fraction /4,-1.</s>
<s snum=78>A sample of Fraction **f from group ~O plasma was dissolved in starting buffer, dialyzed against this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown in Fig. 2.</s>
<s snum=79>Once again, both anti-~A and anti-~B activities were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis.</s>
<s snum=80>Similarly, both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the chromatographic eluate, having extremely low, low, and high anionic binding capacity, respectively (Fig. 3).</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=81>Chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of ~Rh antibody activity were generally continuous and wide.</s>
<s snum=82>The incomplete antibody activity appeared in the early part of the chromatogram; the complete, in the latter part.</s>
<s snum=83>The serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete antibodies showed activity in both regions (Fig. 1).</s>
<s snum=84>In all cases the activity against **f cells was spread over a wider area than that with **f cells, regardless of the type of test (saline, albumin, indirect Coombs) used for comparison.</s>
<s snum=85>The insoluble material resulting from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity.</s>
<s snum=86>In fact agglutination of **f cells in saline could be produced by the insoluble material from sera containing ``only'' incomplete antibody activity.</s>
<s snum=87>This was later known to be the result of concentrating the minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera; when the insoluble fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample, no complete antibody activity could be detected.</s>
