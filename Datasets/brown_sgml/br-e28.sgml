<p>
<s snum=1>Marketing in the new decade will be no picnic- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yr..</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=2>Why?</s>
<s snum=3>Companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies- in modern equipment and new processes, enlarged ~R+D facilities, faster new product development.</s>
<s snum=4>Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling, distribution, and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=5>Given this kind of business climate, what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yr.?</s>
<s snum=6>Based on our experience with clients, we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups- the market place itself, marketing methods, and marketing management.</s>
</p>
<hl>1.PROBLEMS IN THE MARKET</hl>
<hl>@ GREATER PRICE-CONSCIOUSNESS.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=7>There has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years; there is every indication it will continue.</s>
<s snum=8>Frequently, wittingly or unwittingly, price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers, distributors, and dealers.</s>
<s snum=9>Despite generally good levels of income, we see greater price pressures than ever before- traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=10>Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target:</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=11>Has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning?</s>
<s snum=12>Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse?</s>
<s snum=13>Have you actually checked out (not just mentally tested)different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem?</s>
</p>
<hl>@ INCREASED CUSTOMER SOPHISTICATION.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=14>Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims, partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions.</s>
<s snum=15>This problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses.</s>
<s snum=16>Have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company?</s>
</p>
<hl>@ GREATER DEMAND FOR SERVICES.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=17>Need for service is here to stay- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties.</s>
<s snum=18>There are two reasons for this.</s>
<s snum=19>First, most products tend to become more complex.</s>
<s snum=20>Second, in a competitive market, the customer feels his weight and throws it around.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=21>Providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product.</s>
<s snum=22>Too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=23>Good service starts with product design and planning:</s>
<s snum=24>Many products seem to be designed for a production economy, not for a service one.</s>
<s snum=25>Proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization, and your distributor organizations, not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>Have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention?</s>
</p>
<hl>@ WIDER DISCRETIONARY CHOICES FOR CUSTOMERS.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=27>In spending his money today, the consumer is pulled in many directions.</s>
<s snum=28>To the manufacturer of the more convenient-type product- the purchase of which can be switched, delayed, or put off entirely- the implications are important.</s>
<s snum=29>Your competition is now proportionately greater- you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products.</s>
<s snum=31>Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole ``discretionary buying'' area?</s>
</p>
<hl>@ GEOGRAPHIC SHIFT OF CUSTOMERS.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=32>The trends have been in evidence for many years- population shifts to the Southwest and Far West, and from city to suburbs.</s>
<s snum=33>These shifts will continue in the next 10 yr..</s>
<s snum=34>Have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation, strength of distributor organizations, and even plant location?</s>
</p>
<hl>@ MARKET CONCENTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION IN FEWER ACCOUNTS.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=35>We have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry- at both the manufacturing and retail ends.</s>
<s snum=36>Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts, there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=37>The change may require different products, pricing, packaging, warehousing, salesmanship, advertising and executive attention- practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted.</s>
<s snum=38>Have you examined these trends, forecast the effects, and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances?</s>
</p>
<hl>2.PROBLEMS IN MARKETING METHODS</hl>
<hl>@ MORE PRIVATE LABEL COMPETITION.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=39>In the area of private label competition, it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade.</s>
<s snum=40>As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size, there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the distributor's profits- which is, in effect, what the sale of private brands tends to do.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=41>Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business, delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded.</s>
<s snum=42>Moreover, the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality- and the customer seems to have caught on.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=43>If you are up against private brand competition, have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position?</s>
<s snum=44>If private brand competition hasn't been felt in your product field as yet, have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear?</s>
</p>
<hl>@ LESS PERSONAL SALESMANSHIP.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=45>Display merchandising, backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion, will continue to make strides in the sixties.</s>
<s snum=46>It has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=47>How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important?</s>
<s snum=48>If you have a higher-quality product, how can you make it stand out- justify its premium price- without the spoken word?</s>
<s snum=49>Salesmanship is still necessary, but it's a different brand of salesmanship.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=50>Have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products?</s>
<s snum=51>Have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing?</s>
<s snum=52>Are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers?</s>
</p>
<hl>@ HIGHER COSTS OF DISTRIBUTION GENERALLY.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=53>Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure, some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes.</s>
<s snum=54>No manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=55>The use of bulk handling is continuously growing.</s>
<s snum=56>Computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels.</s>
<s snum=57>``Selective selling''- concentrating sales on the larger accounts- has been used effectively by some manufacturers.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=58>There may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain.</s>
<s snum=59>Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully- and with some imagination?</s>
<s snum=60>In your sales force, will a smaller number of higher-priced, high-quality salesmen serve you best, or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=61>Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share?</s>
<s snum=62>In one company covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men, the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos..</s>
<s snum=63>As a result, distribution costs were cut, customer relations improved.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job.</s>
</p>
<hl>@ HIGHER COSTS OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=65>From the manufacturer's point of view, the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties.</s>
<s snum=66>It is accentuated by the need for pre-selling goods, and private label competition.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=67>How much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program?</s>
<s snum=68>Are you following competition willy-nilly- trying to match dollar for dollar- or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers?</s>
<s snum=69>Have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program- from the standpoint of effort, money, and effectiveness?</s>
</p>
<hl>@ INCREASING TEMPO OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=70>Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon.</s>
<s snum=71>Will you be out in the market place with some of these sales-building new products?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=72>If competition beats you to it, this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store.</s>
<s snum=73>On the other hand, the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive.</s>
<s snum=74>As markets become larger and marketing more complex, the costs of an error become progressively larger.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>Is your ~R+D or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market?</s>
<s snum=76>Are there regular communications from the field, or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with ~R+D people?</s>
<s snum=77>Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing, but it's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization; who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume, production, and distribution costs; and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance?</s>
<s snum=79>We have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans- and management couldn't make up its mind.</s>
</p>
<hl>3.PROBLEMS IN MARKETING MANAGEMENT</hl>
<hl>@ SHORTAGE OF SKILLED SALESMEN.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=80>There is a shortage of salesmen today.</s>
<s snum=81>In the future, quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy, and the qualitative need will be greater still.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>While many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel, much of it has been product rather than sales training.</s>
<s snum=83>Nor has the training been enough in relation to the need.</s>
<s snum=84>Most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=85>Have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future (both quantitatively and qualitatively)?</s>
<s snum=86>Has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yr.?</s>
</p>
<hl>@ SHORTAGE OF SALES MANAGEMENT TALENT.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=87>With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition, sales management, whether at the district, region or headquarters level, is a tough job today- and it will be tougher in the future.</s>
<s snum=88>Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work.</s>
<s snum=89>The growth of business has outdistanced the available supply, and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=90>Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term?</s>
<s snum=91>Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people?</s>
</p>
<hl>@ COMPLEXITY OF COMPLETE MARKETING PLANNING.</hl>
<p>
<s snum=92>Every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning.</s>
<s snum=93>``Hip-pocket'' tactics are going to be harder to apply.</s>
<s snum=94>Many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis.</s>
<s snum=95>They have to be.</s>
<s snum=96>With greater investments in plant facilities, with automation growing, you can't switch around, either in volume or in product design, as much as was formerly possible- or at least not as economically.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=97>Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company?</s>
<s snum=98>We find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=99>Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team?</s>
<s snum=100>Do you have a long-term (5- or 10-yr.) marketing program?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=101>The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining your company's marketing problems realistically.</s>
<s snum=102>Solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems, whether they be in the market, in marketing methods or in marketing management.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=103>If companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke, then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade.</s>
