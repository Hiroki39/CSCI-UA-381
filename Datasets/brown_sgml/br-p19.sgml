<s snum=1>I don't really believe in intuition.</s>
<s snum=2>But I swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes, I knew it was going to be a bad day.</s>
<s snum=3>Part of it was the weather, so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital.</s>
<s snum=4>Part of it was being so tired- I'd not only had my usual full day yesterday, but a dinner meeting as well, that kept me up late.</s>
<s snum=5>But the rest of it, the main part, wasn't based on logic at all.</s>
<s snum=6>It was just going to be one of those days.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>For the thousandth time, I wished I'd chosen some nice, nine-to-five, five-days-a-week profession.</s>
<s snum=8>And for the thousandth time, I answered myself.</s>
<s snum=9>I hadn't chosen medicine- it had chosen me.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=10>Actually, I shouldn't complain, I told myself in the shaving mirror.</s>
<s snum=11>I had a lot to be thankful for.</s>
<s snum=12>A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at.</s>
<s snum=13>Maybe I didn't see as much of Gladdy as I'd like, but how much worse it would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice went- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home.</s>
<s snum=14>At least, we were together and we had Mrs. Hodges, bless her, to look after us- no mother could be fonder of Gladdy than Mrs. Hodges was.</s>
<s snum=15>I was lucky in lots of ways, no doubt about it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=16>Especially in the way Gladdy had turned out.</s>
<s snum=17>Growing up without a mother from the time she was three- it wasn't a good thing for a child, even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been.</s>
<s snum=18>But I mustn't start on Alice.</s>
<s snum=19>She is a closed book, a picture I keep on my bureau, but never look at.</s>
<s snum=20>If she'd kept on as she'd been going, the story I'd told Gladdy would probably have been true by now, anyhow.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=21>As usual, Gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table.</s>
<s snum=22>Her first class wasn't until ten, but she always got up to have breakfast with me.</s>
<s snum=23>It made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided, all on her own, to go to college right here in town made me feel good, too.</s>
<s snum=24>Oh, I knew that I couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision.</s>
<s snum=25>I had a feeling that young Pete Michelson, the most promising intern at Fairview, had something to do with it, too.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>She'd been out with Pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little.</s>
<s snum=27>But once I was alone again, driving to the hospital, the heaviness returned.</s>
<s snum=28>If she and Pete were really getting serious, I'd have to do some hard thinking.</s>
<s snum=29>Should I tell him the truth about Alice?</s>
<s snum=30>Did he have a right to know the secret I'd kept from Gladdy all these years?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=31>The boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to Fairview.</s>
<s snum=32>Two interns and Dick Ishii, the other resident.</s>
<s snum=33>I'm Chief of Medicine here and this morning would start like all others, with me taking the boys on the rounds.</s>
<s snum=34>Pete was down on Seven, Dick told me, and he'd meet us there.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>There wasn't anything of special interest that morning, no one sicker than they should have been.</s>
<s snum=36>Pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on Seven- he'd had a case of post-operative shock, but it was all taken care of now.</s>
<s snum=37>Seven is a women's floor and, as it happened, not very busy right then.</s>
<s snum=38>When we'd finished our regular rounds, Pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=39>``Got a new one in last night'', he said.</s>
<s snum=40>``I haven't seen her yet, but I hear she's a lulu''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=41>I wasn't surprised.</s>
<s snum=42>The ward was a small one, four beds, kept reserved for female alcoholics.</s>
<s snum=43>We didn't get many at Fairview and they were never pretty sights.</s>
<s snum=44>It was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=45>The moment I walked in, the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed.</s>
<s snum=46>They'd cleaned her up some, of course, and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk.</s>
<s snum=47>But there was something about her- and I felt my lips forming a name.</s>
<s snum=48>Alice.</s>
<s snum=49>But this woman's name was Rose Bancroft!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=50>I looked at the chart for reassurance.</s>
<s snum=51>Yes, Rose Bancroft, diagnosis: acute alcoholism.</s>
<s snum=52>She looked about sixty, though I recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four.</s>
<s snum=53>An ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face, already marred by the tell-tale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry.</s>
<s snum=54>Her coarse hair was two-colored- bleached blonde and its real, dirty gray.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=55>Oh, could it be?</s>
<s snum=56>No, no, it was an unfortunate resemblance, that was all it was, and I turned to Dick, forcing myself to put my disquiet out of my mind.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=57>In a low voice, Dick filled us in.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=58>She'd been picked up downtown, passed out in the doorway.</s>
<s snum=59>Although quiet when they brought her in, she'd suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out.</s>
<s snum=60>It was the old story.</s>
<s snum=61>We'd keep her a day or two, and the ~AA people would talk to her.</s>
<s snum=62>But if she wasn't interested, she'd just go back to the same life she'd left.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=63>Turning toward the patient again, I- I can't describe what happened to me then, except to say that I felt sick.</s>
<s snum=64>I tell you, it took every ounce of control I had to be able to speak.</s>
<s snum=65>``Now, Miss- or is it Mrs.Bancroft''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=66>I never liked going straight into an examination with patients- it relaxes them, I've always thought, to chat first.</s>
<s snum=67>This was one time I'd have gladly broken my own rule, but habit was too strong.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>``Hey''!</s>
<s snum=69>Her voice was flat and dull.</s>
<s snum=70>But those penetrating eyes- I had to turn my head away.</s>
<s snum=71>It was then that I saw what the drawn-back covers revealed.</s>
<s snum=72>There were bloodspots on the sheet.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=73>``What's this''?</s>
<s snum=74>I asked.</s>
<s snum=75>``Your period''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>She shook her head.</s>
<s snum=77>``I been spotting a little now and then'', she said quietly, no emotion in her voice.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>``Have you spoken to a doctor about it''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=79>Once again, there was a negative shake.</s>
<s snum=80>I told Miss Groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table.</s>
<s snum=81>``Better do a Papanicolaou'', I told Pete.</s>
<s snum=82>It was only a few moments before Miss Groggins had her in the proper position for a vaginal, but I couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination.</s>
<s snum=83>Pete stood by with a slide and took the smear, sent it down to the lab with a request for the test.</s>
<s snum=84>That done, I told Miss Groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=85>I was busy the rest of the day.</s>
<s snum=86>Late in the afternoon, I was up on Seven again.</s>
<s snum=87>One of my private patients was being admitted and I went in to see her settled.</s>
<s snum=88>On my way to the elevator, I ran into Pete.</s>
<s snum=89>``I've got the results on the Bancroft smear test'', he said.</s>
<s snum=90>``There's something there, all right.</s>
<s snum=91>Class Three, they said.</s>
<s snum=92>Do you want to talk to her, doctor''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=93>``Well''- I didn't- I didn't ever want to see that woman again.</s>
<s snum=94>But that was ridiculous, of course.</s>
<s snum=95>``All right.</s>
<s snum=96>We'll do a D. and C. and get her permission for a hysterectomy.</s>
<s snum=97>Maybe it's nothing, maybe it's intraepithelial or in situ- can't take any chances''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=98>``If you can keep her here that long'', Pete said wryly.</s>
<s snum=99>``Groggins tells me she's started badgering already, wants to get out.</s>
<s snum=100>Wants to get to her booze, I guess''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=101>I grimaced in distaste.</s>
<s snum=102>``Well, better see what I can do''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=103>We'd been standing right outside Miss Bancroft's door and as I went to turn the knob to enter, I was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar.</s>
<s snum=104>But she seemed to be dozing and in any case, we'd been talking in low tones.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=105>Her eyes opened as soon as she heard me, though, and once again, I felt an inward shiver.</s>
<s snum=106>``I sure can't complain about the service in this place'', she said.</s>
<s snum=107>``I just got through seeing one of you guys.</s>
<s snum=108>What do you want''?</s>
<s snum=109>There was something almost insulting in her tone, but I disregarded it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=110>``I've just been talking to Dr. Michelson'', I said.</s>
<s snum=111>``We'd like you to have a dilatation and curettage.</s>
<s snum=112>That's quite minor, nothing to worry about.</s>
<s snum=113>But we would like your permission to do- that is, to go further if it proves necessary''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=114>``No''.</s>
<s snum=115>It was flat, definite.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=116>``Suppose you let me explain.</s>
<s snum=117>Actually, I rather doubt that we'll have to do this.</s>
<s snum=118>Even if we do, you'll be out of here in a week, probably''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=119>I was sure that was the difficulty- she just didn't want to stay here, where she couldn't get to the liquor.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=120>``No''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=121>I looked at her in amazement.</s>
<s snum=122>I'd had patients who'd refused surgery before, of course, but never one who didn't show, in one way or another, the reason why.</s>
<s snum=123>Mostly, it was fear, but this woman's voice didn't tremble and her hands were still on the coverlet.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=124>``Will you tell me why''?</s>
<s snum=125>I asked.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=126>She smiled, a smile without humor.</s>
<s snum=127>``You shouldn't tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door'', she said.</s>
<s snum=128>``I've got cancer, haven't I''?</s>
<s snum=129>She went on, disregarding my protests.</s>
<s snum=130>``I'm not going to be one of your guinea pigs.</s>
<s snum=131>Let your pupils learn on someone else, doctor.</s>
<s snum=132>Just let me die in peace''.</s>
</p>
<hl>@</hl>
<p>
<s snum=133>I stared at her, almost speechless.</s>
<s snum=134>Her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person I thought she was.</s>
<s snum=135>Even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone.</s>
<s snum=136>This was someone who'd come down in the world, I thought.</s>
<s snum=137>A long, long way down.</s>
<s snum=138>Again there was something familiar about her, something.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=139>``You haven't got cancer'', I said as strongly as I could.</s>
<s snum=140>``I don't know what you heard that would make you think so, but I assure you I don't even know myself, so how can you be so sure?</s>
<s snum=141>And even if-''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=142>``Don't give me a lot of talk, Joe''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=143>I gaped at her.</s>
<s snum=144>She could have found out my first name, of course- that wouldn't be difficult.</s>
<s snum=145>But there was that something, some echo in the way she spoke.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=146>She was watching me intently, a funny little half-smile on her lips.</s>
<s snum=147>``Surprised, baby?</s>
<s snum=148>Guess I've changed, haven't I?</s>
<s snum=149>But you haven't changed much, Joe''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=150>I knew then, knew with a heart-stopping shock.</s>
<s snum=151>``Alice''- I stammered through dry lips.</s>
<s snum=152>``Alice, for goodness sake-''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=153>``Alice'', she echoed mockingly.</s>
<s snum=154>``What's the matter, Joe, you scared of me?</s>
<s snum=155>Think I'm going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife?</s>
<s snum=156>Well, don't worry.</s>
<s snum=157>Just let me outta here-''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=158>``But why did you come back''?</s>
<s snum=159>I'd found my voice.</s>
<s snum=160>``Where have you been all these years''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=161>She shrugged.</s>
<s snum=162>``Here and there.</s>
<s snum=163>As for coming back here- well, I'll tell you the truth, I didn't even know where I was when I came to.</s>
<s snum=164>The last thing I remember is a bar in San Diego-''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=165>The way she spoke, her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout, made me shudder.</s>
<s snum=166>And this was Gladdy's mother!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=167>``I never asked you for any favors, Joe'', she went on, ``but I'm asking one now.</s>
<s snum=168>Let me outta here!</s>
<s snum=169>You doctors are all alike- all you want is to cut up people and what's the good?</s>
<s snum=170>No, I want out, Joe''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=171>I looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me.</s>
<s snum=172>Let her out, let her out- that would be the solution, wouldn't it?</s>
<s snum=173>What she'd said was true- in all these years, she'd never asked for anything from me.</s>
<s snum=174>If I let her go, she'd disappear once more.</s>
<s snum=175>And Gladdy would be safe!</s>
