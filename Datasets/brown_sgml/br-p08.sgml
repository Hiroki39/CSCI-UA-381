<s snum=1>Rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the Torah.</s>
<s snum=2>Bits of trash lay in the roadway.</s>
<s snum=3>The air smelled warmish and foul.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=4>A young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides.</s>
<s snum=5>He wore a long double-breasted coat of a heavy material, dark trousers, and black boots with buckles.</s>
<s snum=6>His black hat with its wide brim, high crown, and fur trim rode high.</s>
<s snum=7>With his head erect, he approached, not glancing at us, and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead.</s>
<s snum=8>He had a pinkish-white complexion, a small straight nose, a short black beard, and tightly curled paot.</s>
<s snum=9>I was suddenly conscious of my bare arms.</s>
<s snum=10>The girls in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings.</s>
<s snum=11>I turned and watched him stride down the center of the road.</s>
<s snum=12>His hands were swinging at his sides, and he passed through the dingy market place with his back straight and, pivoting on his heel, he entered an old stone building.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=13>Rachel had seen me watching the young man.</s>
<s snum=14>She smiled.</s>
<s snum=15>``When your mother was here he must have been a young boy.</s>
<s snum=16>Like the ones you will see now''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=17>I swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside Rachel.</s>
<s snum=18>She led me into a twisting side alley.</s>
<s snum=19>The dirty, discolored buildings looked boarded up, and their few windows stood high above our heads.</s>
<s snum=20>Rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most of the buildings.</s>
<s snum=21>We entered one where the front door stood ajar and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor.</s>
<s snum=22>An old man with a white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat, baggy trousers, and a black skullcap greeted us.</s>
<s snum=23>Rachel talked to him.</s>
<s snum=24>He nodded, clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch, and flicked glances at me.</s>
<s snum=25>I thought he would ask us to leave because Rachel and I were bare-armed, but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor.</s>
<s snum=26>His toes pointed out toward the walls.</s>
<s snum=27>He stopped in front of a door, placed a finger on his lips, and, still peering down into his beard, pushed open the door to a classroom.</s>
<s snum=28>We stepped inside.</s>
<s snum=29>He left us.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>Little boys crowded together on long wooden benches, and in the center of the room sat the teacher.</s>
<s snum=31>His black beard dripped down over the front of his coat.</s>
<s snum=32>One white hand poised a stick above his desk.</s>
<s snum=33>He turned his surly, half-closed eyes toward us, stared for a second, then shouted in Yiddish, ``One, two, three''!</s>
<s snum=34>rapping the stick against the desk.</s>
<s snum=35>The little boys shrilled out a Yiddish translation or interpretation of the Five Books of Moses, which they had previously chanted in Hebrew.</s>
<s snum=36>They chanted a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick.</s>
<s snum=37>Each boy opened his small mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and great-grandfather had studied and prayed in the ghettos of Europe.</s>
<s snum=38>The boys were tiny.</s>
<s snum=39>They had large bright eyes, the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere, and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing their little white faces.</s>
<s snum=40>They bent over yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher.</s>
<s snum=41>Since they did not glance curiously at us once, I guessed that there was a penalty for distraction.</s>
<s snum=42>The guttural language from the ghetto stopped.</s>
<s snum=43>The teacher plunged the children into a new portion, this time in Hebrew, rapping the stick incessantly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=44>One boy who rocked back and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and freckles.</s>
<s snum=45>His tightly curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders.</s>
<s snum=46>In the center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap.</s>
<s snum=47>His head barely rose above the table.</s>
<s snum=48>I stared at him for a long time.</s>
<s snum=49>He did not return my interest.</s>
<s snum=50>My eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys.</s>
<s snum=51>Some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the words long ago.</s>
<s snum=52>They singsonged the portion at the teacher, who accompanied them in an off-key baritone and spurred them on with the stick.</s>
<s snum=53>The tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake.</s>
<s snum=54>I could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair.</s>
<s snum=55>His body pitched back and forth on the bench.</s>
<s snum=56>His front teeth were missing.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=57>I shuddered and backed out of the room.</s>
<s snum=58>Rachel followed, looked at me, and clucked with her tongue.</s>
<s snum=59>We walked down the cool hall silently.</s>
<s snum=60>From behind us came the rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and prayer.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=61>I said, ``How long do they keep that up''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=62>``All day'', she said.</s>
<s snum=63>``Except for Shabbat, when they are praying all day''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>I rubbed my hands together.</s>
<s snum=65>They had turned numb and prickly in the classroom.</s>
<s snum=66>The old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps.</s>
<s snum=67>He glanced down into his beard and muttered something in Yiddish.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>Rachel said, ``He asks for money''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=69>She passed by him.</s>
<s snum=70>I reached into the pocket of my skirt, fingered ten pruta, and dropped the coin.</s>
<s snum=71>Then I picked it up again and handed it to the old man.</s>
<s snum=72>He thanked me.</s>
<s snum=73>I didn't look at him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=74>I grinned at Rachel.</s>
<s snum=75>``Does this bother you''?</s>
<s snum=76>I said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=77>She smiled to herself.</s>
<s snum=78>``Most of our Sabras think it's horrible.</s>
<s snum=79>When we were fighting, a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass.</s>
<s snum=80>They said that we must not fight but wait for the Messiah''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=81>I was amazed.</s>
<s snum=82>You had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home.</s>
<s snum=83>You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal.</s>
<s snum=84>And I wasn't.</s>
<s snum=85>I was American.</s>
<s snum=86>You had to know, also, that you were going to fail.</s>
<s snum=87>All of it might have been heroic, but they had done it in the wrong place.</s>
<s snum=88>I resented them.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=89>Rachel faced me.</s>
<s snum=90>Her bright eyes were twinkling.</s>
<s snum=91>She said, ``Sometimes I think they are keeping religion for us while we play around.</s>
<s snum=92>Your mother hated this way of life.</s>
<s snum=93>She wished to change much for the children here''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=94>I said quietly, respectfully, ``What did she do here?</s>
<s snum=95>In this section''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=96>Rachel clicked her tongue behind her teeth.</s>
<s snum=97>``Here, nothing.</s>
<s snum=98>But when she saw the children you have just visited, she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country, in the kibbutzim.</s>
<s snum=99>She loved the children.</s>
<s snum=100>She was a strange woman, your mother.</s>
<s snum=101>When she loved, it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved.</s>
<s snum=102>Nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted.</s>
<s snum=103>She stayed here to work for Aliah.</s>
<s snum=104>For many immigrants, for many children, the first thing they knew of Israel and freedom was your mother.</s>
<s snum=105>Sometimes it was dangerous for her''.</s>
<s snum=106>Rachel grinned slyly.</s>
<s snum=107>``But she loved danger.</s>
<s snum=108>She took it with her wherever she went; she chose it.</s>
<s snum=109>And I think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people.</s>
<s snum=110>She was most strange woman.</s>
<s snum=111>Ready to follow her impulse.</s>
<s snum=112>It was an impulse when she was here in Me'a She'arim- I was with her- that led her to stay in Israel.</s>
<s snum=113>Your mother wanted to bring children to Israel so that they could leave their ghettos.</s>
<s snum=114>Here they did not need to be in ghettos.</s>
<s snum=115>If she could not take the children out of this section, at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms.</s>
<s snum=116>She set out to make sure that no Jewish child anyplace in the world had to live in a place such as this''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>I said quietly, gaining nerve, ready to ask any question at all, no matter how intimate, ready to be rebuffed, ``Then why did she leave Israel?</s>
<s snum=118>I'd like to know that very much''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=119>Rachel clasped her hands together and slowed her pace.</s>
<s snum=120>The soles of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones.</s>
<s snum=121>She pursed her lips, then clamped them together so tightly that I thought she was angry with me.</s>
<s snum=122>But she sighed and her face relaxed.</s>
<s snum=123>``Trouble came into her life.</s>
<s snum=124>She had good friends here, people who liked her.</s>
<s snum=125>Who loved her.</s>
<s snum=126>But she had to go out and hurt herself.</s>
<s snum=127>There was a man here in town.</s>
<s snum=128>He helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted.</s>
<s snum=129>She worked very hard.</s>
<s snum=130>There was a refugee who was able to come here because of her.</s>
<s snum=131>He came with his son.</s>
<s snum=132>At first I thought they were relatives of your mother, but it was not so.</s>
<s snum=133>This refugee was a middle-aged man, a big, handsome man with a strut to his walk as I have never before seen.</s>
<s snum=134>He had the black numerals on his arm, so he had been branded in a concentration camp.</s>
<s snum=135>Yet he walked like a young man.</s>
<s snum=136>Often he was terribly despondent and talked to no one.</s>
<s snum=137>Then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of Europe.</s>
<s snum=138>All his family was dead, except for his son.</s>
<s snum=139>Your mother would always retrieve him when he wandered off, and she would send him home to his son.</s>
<s snum=140>He loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him.</s>
<s snum=141>Then his son did something''- Rachel threw up her hands- ``I don't know what, but something, to an official here- it was during the Mandate- and the son was imprisoned.</s>
<s snum=142>A few hours after the son was arrested, your mother was informed.</s>
<s snum=143>She ran from a little group of us.</s>
<s snum=144>We were sitting together, talking.</s>
<s snum=145>She went to the father and found he had hanged himself''.</s>
<s snum=146>Rachel paused.</s>
<s snum=147>It was silent in the stone alley.</s>
<s snum=148>Then she continued with energy, ``I myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father.</s>
<s snum=149>No one saw her except the man Reuveni''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=150>``Yes'', I said.</s>
<s snum=151>``I know him''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=152>Rachel gave me a direct, bright-eyed look.</s>
<s snum=153>She said, ``Reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this refugee.</s>
<s snum=154>He said she would only hurt herself.</s>
<s snum=155>He complained to me once that I must talk to her.</s>
<s snum=156>When I did, she shrugged her shoulders and said that Reuveni wanted her to marry him.</s>
<s snum=157>I asked her if she would, and she said she would not.</s>
<s snum=158>He had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him.</s>
<s snum=159>Anyway, I did not see her until two weeks after the refugee hanged himself.</s>
<s snum=160>She came to me one day.</s>
<s snum=161>She was pale and skinny; she was terribly alone.</s>
<s snum=162>And she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to Reuveni and accepted his proposal.</s>
<s snum=163>He shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn't understand why she had upset herself.</s>
<s snum=164>But now he was happy she would let him straighten out her life and take care of her.</s>
<s snum=165>He would never let her harm herself again.</s>
<s snum=166>For one whole week he never let her stay alone.</s>
<s snum=167>She let him lead her around.</s>
<s snum=168>He took her to a doctor, for she was run down, nervous, did not care where she was.</s>
<s snum=169>Reuveni took her with him wherever he went.</s>
<s snum=170>He did not let her talk to people; he did not let her choose her own food.</s>
<s snum=171>She was limp and beaten from her loss; she did not care.</s>
