<s snum=1>Andy did not see the newspapers the next day.</s>
<s snum=2>Someone on his staff- he suspected it was Ed Thornburg- intercepted them and for this Andy was grateful.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=3>He finally fell asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping capsule, a crutch he rarely used, and didn't awaken until early afternoon.</s>
<s snum=4>Memory flooded him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=5>Outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day.</s>
<s snum=6>Presumably the same sun was shining upon little Drew also, and those who had kidnapped him.</s>
<s snum=7>But where?</s>
<s snum=8>It was still a very big world, despite all the modern cant to the contrary.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=9>Hub was sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door.</s>
<s snum=10>He was dozing, perhaps the only sleep he'd gotten.</s>
<s snum=11>He snapped to alertness at Andy's entrance.</s>
<s snum=12>``Sorry, Mr. Paxton.</s>
<s snum=13>Nothing new.</s>
<s snum=14>Lot of people waiting to see you, though''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=15>``Reporters''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=16>``Our own people.</s>
<s snum=17>Questions about the show tonight''.</s>
<s snum=18>Hub picked up the telephone.</s>
<s snum=19>``Shall I let them know you're awake''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=20>``I suppose.</s>
<s snum=21>How's Lissa, do you know''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=22>Hub considered.</s>
<s snum=23>``Some better.</s>
<s snum=24>She's got plenty of guts, Mr. Paxton.</s>
<s snum=25>You want me to call her''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>``She expecting me to''?</s>
<s snum=27>Hub shook his head so Andy told him not to bother.</s>
<s snum=28>The only reason for contacting Lissa was to comfort or to be comforted.</s>
<s snum=29>He could not manage the former or expect the latter; they had nothing to give to each other.</s>
<s snum=30>The omission might look peculiar to outsiders, but Andy could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake of appearances.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=31>He had little time to himself, anyway.</s>
<s snum=32>As the afternoon sped toward evening, the suite saw a steady procession of Paxton aides pass in and out, each with his own special problem.</s>
<s snum=33>Thornburg arrived with the writers.</s>
<s snum=34>They had spent the morning revising the act, eliminating all the gay songs, patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations.</s>
<s snum=35>What remained lacked the original verve but it was at least dignified, as befitting the tragic circumstances.</s>
<s snum=36>Raymond Fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed ``Cradle Song'' in case it was needed.</s>
<s snum=37>Charlie Marble was back and forth on several occasions, first to confer with Andy on the advisability of cancelling the Las Vegas engagement- they decided it was wise- and later to announce that a prominent comedian, also an agency client, had agreed to fill the casino's open date.</s>
<s snum=38>And once Bake slipped in, pale and drawn, last night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it.</s>
<s snum=39>He asked if there was anything he could do.</s>
<s snum=40>Andy invented a job to keep him busy, sending him ahead to El Dorado to supervise last minute arrangements.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=41>But from Rocco Vecchio, they heard nothing.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=42>At last it was time to depart.</s>
<s snum=43>Hub, nosing about, spotted reporters in the lobby, so Andy was hustled away quietly through the hotel's service entrance in a strange car which Hub had procured somewhere.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=44>They succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel, but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub.</s>
<s snum=45>El Dorado was surrounded by a mob.</s>
<s snum=46>They overflowed the parking lot, making progress by automobile difficult.</s>
<s snum=47>Long before he reached the protection of the stage door, Andy was recognized.</s>
<s snum=48>Word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brushfire.</s>
<s snum=49>They surged around him, fingers pointing, eyes prying.</s>
<s snum=50>It was not a hostile gathering but Andy sensed the difference from last night's hero-worshippers.</s>
<s snum=51>They had come not to admire but to observe.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>``It's worse inside'', Thornburg informed Andy.</s>
<s snum=53>``Skolman's jammed in every table he could find.</s>
<s snum=54>Under the heading of it's an ill wind, et cetera''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=55>Backstage was tomblike by contrast.</s>
<s snum=56>Andy's co-workers kept their distance, awed by the tragedy.</s>
<s snum=57>But in his dressing room was a large bouquet and a card that read, ``We're with you all the way''.</s>
<s snum=58>It was signed by everyone in the troupe.</s>
<s snum=59>Andy couldn't help but be touched.</s>
<s snum=60>He instructed Shirl Winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call board.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=61>Bake was waiting to report that Lou DuVol had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently.</s>
<s snum=62>Andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment.</s>
<s snum=63>Bake himself looked better; any kind of job was better than brooding.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>Andy told him, ``Bake, I wish you'd talk to Skolman, see if some kind of p. a. system can be rigged up outside.</s>
<s snum=65>It's just barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper wasn't able to get a table.</s>
<s snum=66>I wouldn't want him to miss the message''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=67>``I'll try.</s>
<s snum=68>Skolman isn't going to like it much, though, giving away what he should be selling''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=69>Skolman wasn't the only one who didn't care for Andy's scheme.</s>
<s snum=70>A short time later, Lieutenant Bonner stomped into the dressing room.</s>
<s snum=71>``I got a bone to pick with you, Mr. Paxton.</s>
<s snum=72>It's those damn loudspeakers''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=73>Andy rolled up the revised script he had been studying.</s>
<s snum=74>``What about them''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>``They're going to louse me up good.</s>
<s snum=76>My men have been here all afternoon, setting up for this thing''.</s>
<s snum=77>Bonner explained that, with the nightclub's cooperation, the police had occupied El Dorado like a battlefield.</s>
<s snum=78>Motion picture cameras had been installed to film the audience, the reservation list was being checked out name by name, and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead.</s>
<s snum=79>However, it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside, even if Bonner had manpower available for the purpose.</s>
<s snum=80>``I want you to have the speakers taken out''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=81>Andy sighed.</s>
<s snum=82>``Seems like we're never going to see eye to eye, Lieutenant.</s>
<s snum=83>Didn't they tell you what I wanted the p. a. system for''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>``Sure, I know.</s>
<s snum=85>But it's such a long shot''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=86>``No longer than yours.</s>
<s snum=87>What do you expect to get tonight, anyway?</s>
<s snum=88>You think somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces?</s>
<s snum=89>Or have a sign on his car that says, 'Here Comes the Paxton Kidnapper'''?</s>
<s snum=90>Andy crumbled the script in his fist.</s>
<s snum=91>``I can't stop you from doing what you think is right.</s>
<s snum=92>But don't try to stop me, either''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=93>``Someday'', Bonner said, ``you're going to ask us for help.</s>
<s snum=94>I can hardly wait''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=95>``What you don't understand is that I'm asking for it now''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=96>But Bonner departed, still full of ill will.</s>
<s snum=97>He had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination; he had to cling to routine, tested procedures.</s>
<s snum=98>To act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness.</s>
<s snum=99>But, admit or not, Bonner was helpless.</s>
<s snum=100>The crime showed too much planning, the kidnappers appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=101>Andy's performance was scheduled for eleven o'clock.</s>
<s snum=102>He stalled for a half-hour longer, hoping to hear something from Vecchio about the ransom money.</s>
<s snum=103>Bake and Shirl Winter, on separate telephones, could not reach him at any conceivable location in Los Angeles, nor could they secure any clear-cut information regarding his efforts.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=104>Bake cursed.</s>
<s snum=105>``The sweaty bastard's probably halfway to Peru with our money by now''.</s>
<s snum=106>When no one smiled, he felt constrained to add, ``Just kidding, natch''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=107>Thornburg popped in to advise, ``Andy, Skolman's sending up smoke signals.</s>
<s snum=108>You about ready''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=109>``What's he complaining about''?</s>
<s snum=110>Bake asked.</s>
<s snum=111>``They're drinking, aren't they''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=112>``No.</s>
<s snum=113>We got a bunch of sippers out there tonight.</s>
<s snum=114>I guess nobody wants to pass out and miss anything''.</s>
<s snum=115>Thornburg added in a lower voice but Andy overheard, ``They act more like a jury than an audience''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=116>Andy said, ``Well, I guess we can't wait any longer.</s>
<s snum=117>Hub, you stick by the stage door.</s>
<s snum=118>If Rock shows up during the number- or you hear anything- give me the signal''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=119>Shirl Winter said, ``I'll stay on the phone, Mr.Paxton.</s>
<s snum=120>There's a couple of call-backs I can work on''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=121>``You're a sweetheart- but leave one line open.</s>
<s snum=122>He may try to phone us''.</s>
<s snum=123>Andy passed into the corridor, their ``good lucks''! following him.</s>
<s snum=124>It was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded different, as if he really needed it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=125>They were right.</s>
<s snum=126>The act, cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon, had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone.</s>
<s snum=127>The result had nothing of the polish, pace or cohesion of the previous night.</s>
<s snum=128>Here's where luck would normally step in.</s>
<s snum=129>But this was no ordinary show and Andy knew it.</s>
<s snum=130>Whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it.</s>
<s snum=131>The audience had come not to be entertained but to judge.</s>
<s snum=132>Twenty-four hours had changed him from a performer to a freak.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=133>Within this framework, what followed was strained, even macabre.</s>
<s snum=134>Eliminating the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal melancholy.</s>
<s snum=135>The effect was as depressing as a gravestone, the applause irresolute and short-lived.</s>
<s snum=136>Yet Andy plowed ahead, mouthing the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning, and gradually his listeners warmed to him.</s>
<s snum=137>Their clapping grew more fervent; the evening was still not beyond salvaging, not as a show but for him as a person.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=138>The worst was yet to come.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=139>As Andy reached the finale of his act, a subdued commotion backstage drew his attention to the wings.</s>
<s snum=140>Rocco Vecchio- a perspiring, haggard Vecchio- was standing there, flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored transport guards.</s>
<s snum=141>Vecchio was nodding and pointing at the large suitcase he held.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=142>Andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief.</s>
<s snum=143>He waved at Fox to cut off the finale introduction.</s>
<s snum=144>The music died away discordantly.</s>
<s snum=145>He drew a deep breath.</s>
<s snum=146>``Ladies and gentlemen, in place of my regular closing number tonight, I'd like to sing something of a different nature for you.</s>
<s snum=147>Ray, if you please- the 'Cradle Song'''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=148>He sensed rather than heard the gasp that swept across the audience.</s>
<s snum=149>Nor could he blame them.</s>
<s snum=150>This particular song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste, callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency.</s>
<s snum=151>Having no choice, he plunged into it, anyway, holding onto the microphone for support.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=152>``Lullaby and goodnight''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=153>Hisvoice shook.</s>
<s snum=154>For the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway through and had to cover up by humming the rest.</s>
<s snum=155>He wondered if the audience would let him finish.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=156>They did; though contemptuous, they were still polite.</s>
<s snum=157>But when he was finally through, their scorn was made apparent.</s>
<s snum=158>Someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped.</s>
<s snum=159>Otherwise, the silence was complete.</s>
<s snum=160>As the lights came up, Andy could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward the exit.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=161>He stumbled off-stage.</s>
<s snum=162>``My God'', he muttered.</s>
<s snum=163>``My God''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=164>Hub was there to support him.</s>
<s snum=165>``It's okay, Mr. Paxton.</s>
<s snum=166>The money's here, all of it''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=167>At this moment, all he could think of was what he'd been forced to undergo.</s>
<s snum=168>``Did you hear them?</s>
<s snum=169>Do you know what they think of me''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=170>``Bunch of damn jerks'', Hub growled.</s>
<s snum=171>``Who needs them''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=172>Thornburg patted his arm.</s>
<s snum=173>``Sure, Andy, it'll be all right.</s>
<s snum=174>Nothing broken that can't be mended''.</s>
<s snum=175>The words were hollow.</s>
<s snum=176>Thornburg knew, better than any of them, that a public image was as fragile as Humpty Dumpty.</s>
<s snum=177>All the king's horses and all the king's men.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=178>Vecchio shouldered in.</s>
<s snum=179>``I got it, Andy.</s>
<s snum=180>God knows how, but I got it.</s>
<s snum=181>You'll never believe the places I've been today.</s>
<s snum=182>I practically had to sign your life away, you'll probably fire me for some of the deals I had to go for, but''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=183>Andy nodded dully.</s>
<s snum=184>``It doesn't matter, Rock.</s>
<s snum=185>We've done our part''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=186>He clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room.</s>
<s snum=187>The usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent; the place had the air of a morgue.</s>
<s snum=188>Andy had no desire to linger himself but Hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to disperse them.</s>
