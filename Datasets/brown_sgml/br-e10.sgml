<s snum=1>The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun (we ran a survey to find out) but he's always on the lookout for new and better arms.</s>
<s snum=2>He's more than a reader of outdoor articles; he's a real hunter and shooter, eager to improve his sport.</s>
<s snum=3>Well, if you're that kind of sportsman we're here to help you.</s>
<s snum=4>You've probably given a lot of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack, but it's not easy to decide on a new one.</s>
<s snum=5>You still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most; the time to decide on them is now.</s>
<s snum=6>As a Christmas service, I've taken a close look at this year's crop of new models.</s>
<s snum=7>Here they are, with my comments and judgments.</s>
<s snum=8>Read on, take your pick- and start dropping those hints.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=9>First on my own list would be two arms- a rifle and a handgun- that qualify as new in the strictest sense.</s>
<s snum=10>For me, a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute a truly new design.</s>
<s snum=11>Such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change arms-making concepts.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker (under $110)is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans; it's a short, light, quick-handling, fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game- whitetail.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=13>Ruger reports that on his recent African safari the little .44 Magnum cartridge was a real work horse.</s>
<s snum=14>Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot, and the .44 Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck, kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency; these are fairly large, tough animals.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=15>The deadliness of the .44 Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me.</s>
<s snum=16>At least five years ago, Tom Robinson of Marlin made up an over/under double rifle for me in this caliber, using the now defunct Model 90 action in 20-gauge size.</s>
<s snum=17>After figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact, we fired this little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in Marlin's underground test gallery.</s>
<s snum=18>We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill Ruger in his first experiments: Three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then, unaccountably, one could stray far out of the group.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>Ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet.</s>
<s snum=20>The new, jacketed slug in .44 Magnum corrected this.</s>
<s snum=21>But even without jacketed bullets, I had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year.</s>
<s snum=22>Within half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket, and I caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards.</s>
<s snum=23>He moved only about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him- and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=24>Three more deer have fallen to this same gun, and all were one-shot kills.</s>
<s snum=25>My double was made with standard-weight revolver barrels (before cutting to revolver length), and although it compares well in other respects, it's considerably heavier than the Deerstalker, which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>If ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter, this is it.</s>
<s snum=27>The Deerstalker points with the ease, speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun, and its trigger pull is light and sharp.</s>
<s snum=28>The 240-grain bullet leaves the muzzle at 1,850 ~fps, which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges.</s>
<s snum=29>With five shots at the immediate command of the hunter's trigger finger, the gun and load are a deadly combination.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>The second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load- the .22 Remington Jet Magnum Center Fire.</s>
<s snum=31>At present it's available in one model, the fine and familiar Smith + Wesson Magnum revolver (about $110), long a top-quality handgun among target arms.</s>
<s snum=32>The velocity of this .22-caliber, 40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2,460 ~fps, and it's the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge, with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range.</s>
<s snum=33>This is a varmint load, pure and simple; it's much too explosive for small edible game.</s>
<s snum=34>It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>The most intriguing aspect of the ~S+W Magnum chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard .22rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers.</s>
<s snum=36>You may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm, although the difference in the point of impact (Jet vs. rim-fire) can be somewhat disconcerting.</s>
<s snum=37>The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine; I tested it in my scoped ~S+W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun steadily.</s>
</p>
<hl>HUNTING RIFLES, '61</hl>
<p>
<s snum=38>The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models, actions and calibers.</s>
<s snum=39>Aside from the Ruger carbine, a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time.</s>
<s snum=40>Here are the brands (in alphabetical order) and the new models.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=41>Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning group of bolt-action, high-power rifles.</s>
<s snum=42>They have fine ~FN actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood.</s>
<s snum=43>Barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available, and these include the standard bores (about $165) plus the Magnums (around $170); the latter include the .264, .300 ~H+H, .338, .375 and .458.</s>
<s snum=44>Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the Magnums except the .264.</s>
<s snum=45>Stock designs are excellent for use with scopes.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=46>Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with Sako actions, regardless of caliber.</s>
<s snum=47>The .222's have the short action; the .243 and .308, the medium action, and the .270, **f and the Magnums, the long action (about $135 for the Standard Coltsman and $200 for the Custom version).</s>
<s snum=48>Previously, ~FN actions were used for the larger cartridges.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>High standard has introduced a .22 auto, the Sport-King, in two grades- field and special (less than $45 and just over $45, respectively).</s>
<s snum=50>It's a streamlined rifle, fast and well-made.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=51>Among .22 Magnum Rim-Fire rifles, 1961's lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader (around $60).</s>
<s snum=52>Previously known as Jefferson Arms, Kodiak has given this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design, and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle .22 Magnum rim-fires.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>Marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings.</s>
<s snum=54>The Model 99 (under $45) is a light-weight, streamlined .22 rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles.</s>
<s snum=55>It's extremely accurate for an auto, and the test rifle I tried was completely trouble-free in functioning.</s>
<s snum=56>The 989 (about $40) is an even newer .22 auto, this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=57>Once again the Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared, but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination.</s>
<s snum=58>The bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which, surprisingly, gives pretty fair accuracy even though it's only 3-1/2 inches long.</s>
<s snum=59>You can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with .22 shotshells- to break the little Targo clay targets.</s>
<s snum=60>A trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets.</s>
<s snum=61>A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available.</s>
<s snum=62>You can have your choice of a seven-shot repeater, the ~340TR (about $40) or a single-shot, the ~320TR ($10 less).</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=63>The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice, but it's tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds.</s>
<s snum=64>They'll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35-foot mark.</s>
<s snum=65>The combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds, right now!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=66>Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line for 1961, with the addition of the .375 and .458 to the list of Model 725's.</s>
<s snum=67>These are made on special order only, in Kodiak grade (about $310), with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads; they weigh around nine pounds.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>A shortened version of the highly regarded Remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961.</s>
<s snum=69>This carbine (under $140, about $15 more for a deluxe grade) has an 18-1/2-inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's Model 760 pump with a short-barrel.</s>
<s snum=70>This design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard.</s>
<s snum=71>Presently, the ~742C is available in **f.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=72>The latest versions of the famous Savage Model 99are the 99 Featherweight (about $125) and the 99 Deluxe (under $135), which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design.</s>
<s snum=73>The replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate.</s>
</p>
<hl>BEGINNERS' GUNS, '61</hl>
<p>
<s snum=74>A fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961, and they're good bets for your Christmas gift list if you're wondering what to get for a youngster.</s>
<s snum=75>The most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 (about $20, $5for a saddle scabbard)- a lever-action single-shot patterned after the famous Winchester lever-action and featuring the Western look.</s>
<s snum=76>Because of its traditional lines, it probably has more kid appeal than any other model.</s>
<s snum=77>The action is a drop-block, handling all the standard .22 rim-fires.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>Marlin's latest is also designed for the beginning shooter, although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock.</s>
<s snum=79>This is the Model 122 (about $20); it's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety- i.e., the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot.</s>
<s snum=80>Stock design is excellent, and this model is a good first gun.</s>
<s snum=81>Another boy's model is the .22single-shot Remington ~514C (around $20), which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a short- 12-1/2-inch- stock; it's just right for a boy of 12-1/2.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>A beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year.</s>
<s snum=83>The single-barrel Stevens ~940Y (under $35) is made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun- and the side lever does indeed open very easily.</s>
<s snum=84>This gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is available in either 20 or .410 gauge.</s>
<s snum=85>There's another addition to the Stevens line, the pump-action Model 77 in .410 (under $75), which you may or may not consider a kid's gun; many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too.</s>
</p>
<hl>SHOTGUNS, '61</hl>
<p>
<s snum=86>Although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year, a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market.</s>
<s snum=87>For example, a Browning trap version of the Superposed over/under, the Broadway (from $350 up, depending on grade), differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end, a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=88>The Colt line now includes a new scattergun, the Standard or Custom Pump Model (about $90 and $150, respectively) in 12, 16 and 20.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=89>Firearms International has introduced another import, this one from Finland.</s>
<s snum=90>It's the Valmet (about $170), a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old Remington 32- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=91>High Standard has also added two models to its line.</s>
<s snum=92>The Supermatic Trophy (prices begin at less than $135and depend on grade and optional features) is a 12-gauge auto.</s>
<s snum=93>The Flite-King Trophy (beginning at just over $85) is a pump gun in 12 or 16.</s>
<s snum=94>Either model is a very good dollar value.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=95>Mossberg's latest contribution to the field is the Model 500 (from $73.50); this is an improved version of the old Model 200, a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun.</s>
<s snum=96>See page 24 for a complete report on it.</s>
</p>
<hl>HANDGUNS, '61</hl>
<p>
<s snum=97>Aside from the .22 Jet- which I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the year's two biggest developments- few significant innovations appeared among 1961's handguns.</s>
