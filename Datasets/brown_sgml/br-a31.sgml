<s snum=1>Hotel Escape's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction, the versatile ``Kings /4, Plus Two''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=2>This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while- a well integrated, fast moving outfit specializing in skits, vocals, comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=3>Show spotlights the Kings- George Worth, Bill Kay, Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson, flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=4>The plus two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine, and the beat is solid.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=5>In the comedy division, the Kings simply augmenting talent and imagination with a few props.</s>
<s snum=6>Net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense, part of which can be classed as pure slapstick.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>Kings /4, have rated as a popular act in Vegas and Western nightclubs.</s>
<s snum=8>If they can't chalk up big business here then let's stop this noise about how hip we are, and stick to our community singing.</s>

</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>Newcomers are Ernie Kemm on piano, Wes Robbins, bass and trumpet, and Jack Kelly on drums.</s>
<s snum=20>It's a solid show but, except for some interim keyboarding by Ernie, it's Al's all the way.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=21>Maestro's biggest stock in trade is his personality, and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience.</s>
<s snum=22>He skips around from jazz, to blues to boogie- accompanying himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers in on the act.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=23>This is a bouncy show which may get a little too frantic at times, but is nevertheless worth your appraisal.</s>

<s snum=62>Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism's growing threat on our doorstep and around the world?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=63>More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p.m. Sunday at First Presbyterian Church.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>At that time the second half of the Christian Youth Crusade against Communism will be staged.</s>
<s snum=65>A young real estate salesman, Kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy Air Force.</s>
<s snum=66>He was particularly struck by a course on Communist brainwashing.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=67>Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of Communism, but never felt there was anything he, as an individual, could do about it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>When he attended the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade school here about six months ago, Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=69>The best approach, he figured, was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=70>And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote- a Biblically strong Christianity.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>So the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program.</s>

<s snum=73>The second half of the film ``Communism on the Map'' and the movie ``Operation Abolition'' also will be shown.</s>

<p>
<s snum=74>Response to the program has been so encouraging, Kern said, that a city-wide youth school at Dade County Auditorium may be set up soon.</s>

<s snum=82>They have five daughters- Coral Lee, 5, Glenda Rae, 4, Pamela, 3, Karen, 2, and Shari, five months.</s>
</p>
<p>

<s snum=84>To their surprise, the children all were eager and quite able to take part.</s>
