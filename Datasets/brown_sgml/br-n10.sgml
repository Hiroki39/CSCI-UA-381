<s snum=1>The Brannon outfit- known as the Slash-B because of its brand- reached Hondo Creek before sundown.</s>
<s snum=2>The herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's bedground.</s>
<s snum=3>Two of the new hands, a Mexican named Jose Amado and a kid known only as Laredo, were picked for the first trick of riding night herd.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=4>The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda.</s>
<s snum=5>They got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie's fire, rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes, lounged about.</s>
<s snum=6>There was some idle talk, a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day's drive.</s>
<s snum=7>But they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious:</s>
<s snum=8>the failure of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit.</s>
<s snum=9>It especially bothered the older hands.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=10>The cook, Mateo Garcia, had arrived there long before the herd.</s>
<s snum=11>He'd started a fire and put coffee on, and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon.</s>
<s snum=12>He was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the Dutch oven.</s>
<s snum=13>Supper would be ready within the hour.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=14>The Maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby.</s>
<s snum=15>Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon's and his father's wagon.</s>
<s snum=16>Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire, and his wife was busy at it now.</s>
<s snum=17>Conchita kept an eye on the twins and little Elena, trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing.</s>
<s snum=18>Conchita nagged at the younger children, attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the Maguires joined it, which had been at midday.</s>
<s snum=20>He'd come alone, without his wife and child.</s>
<s snum=21>He'd been in an angry mood: Conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=22>She wondered what had taken place in town, between him and his wife.</s>
<s snum=23>She wished that she could talk to her mother about it.</s>
<s snum=24>Not that her mother knew what had happened, but they could speculate upon it.</s>
<s snum=25>But her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it, and say that it was none of her concern.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>``Pat, get out of that creek!</s>
<s snum=27>You too, Sean!</s>
<s snum=28>Elena, you'll get mud all over your dress''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=29>Even as she called to the children, Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon.</s>
<s snum=30>Tomas, she called him- as the Mexican hands did.</s>
<s snum=31>He was in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero, Luis Hernandez.</s>
<s snum=32>Whatever they are talking about?</s>
<s snum=33>Conchita wondered.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=34>It bothered her that she probably would never know.</s>
<s snum=35>Certainly, she wouldn't dare ask her father afterward.</s>
<s snum=36>He would tell her not to pry into grownups' affairs- as though she were a little kid like Elena!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=37>At the moment, the three men were not saying much of anything.</s>
<s snum=38>They were sitting on their heels, rider-fashion, over by the still empty calf wagon.</s>
<s snum=39>Brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel, with the other two facing him.</s>
<s snum=40>He held a cigarette in his right hand.</s>
<s snum=41>It was burning away, forgotten.</s>
<s snum=42>His face was clouded with unhappiness.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=43>He'd told Hank Maguire and Luis Hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do.</s>
<s snum=44>They were considering it gravely, neither seeming to like what he planned.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=45>Finally Hernandez said, ``I could offer you advice, Tomas, but you wouldn't heed it''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=46>``Let's hear it, anyway''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=47>``Wait a little while.</s>
<s snum=48>Let Senora Brannon live in her father's house for a time.</s>
<s snum=49>Give her time to miss you.</s>
<s snum=50>Maybe she will then come to you.</s>
<s snum=51>After all, you want the senora as much as you want the boy.</s>
<s snum=52>You need her even more than you need him''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>``She won't change her mind'', Brannon said.</s>
<s snum=54>``John Clayton will see to that''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=55>``But after a time away from you &&&''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=56>``A year, Luis?</s>
<s snum=57>Five?</s>
<s snum=58>Ten?</s>
<s snum=59>How long should I wait''?</s>
<s snum=60>``Maybe in a year, Tomas &&&''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=61>``In a year she'll like living in Clayton's house too much to come back to me'', Brannon said flatly.</s>
<s snum=62>``And the boy will be too much under his influence by then.</s>
<s snum=63>I've got to take Danny away from Clayton before I lose him altogether.</s>
<s snum=64>Hell, in a year or five or ten, the boy will have forgotten me- his own father''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=65>``But to take him and leave his mother behind is not good''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=66>``In my place, you'd follow such advice as you give me''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=67>Hernandez looked suddenly uncertain.</s>
<s snum=68>``That I can't answer, for I can't imagine something like this happening to me.</s>
<s snum=69>Maybe I should withdraw my advice- no''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=70>Brannon looked at Hank Maguire.</s>
<s snum=71>``And you?</s>
<s snum=72>What would you do in my place''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=73>Hank shook his head.</s>
<s snum=74>``I don't know, Tom.</s>
<s snum=75>Like Luis, I can't see something like this happening to me.</s>
<s snum=76>With Maria and me, there's never any problem.</s>
<s snum=77>Where I go, she goes- and the kids with us.</s>
<s snum=78>You're going to need your woman.</s>
<s snum=79>And the boy will need his mother.</s>
<s snum=80>If you take the one, you'd better take both''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=81>Brannon shook his head.</s>
<s snum=82>``I won't force Beth to come against her will.</s>
<s snum=83>But I'm going to have my son''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>They were silent for a little while, each looking glum.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=85>Finally Luis Hernandez said, ``What must be, must be.</s>
<s snum=86>I am with you, of course, Tomas''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=87>And Hank Maguire added, ``So am I, Tom''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=88>``All right'', Brannon said, rising.</s>
<s snum=89>``We'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=90>Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall.</s>
<s snum=91>They had for cover both darkness and a summer storm.</s>
<s snum=92>During much of the fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east.</s>
<s snum=93>Later, they'd heard the rumble of thunder and then, just outside Rockfork, they ran into rain.</s>
<s snum=94>Those who had slickers donned them.</s>
<s snum=95>The others put on old coats or ducking jackets, whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=96>There were seven of them, enough for a show of strength- to run a bluff.</s>
<s snum=97>It was to be nothing more than that.</s>
<s snum=98>There was to be no gunplay.</s>
<s snum=99>If the bluff failed and they ran into trouble, Brannon had told the others, they would withdraw- and he would come after his son another time.</s>
<s snum=100>He didn't want to put himself outside the law.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=101>With him were Hank Maguire, Luis Hernandez, and Luis's son Pedro.</s>
<s snum=102>The Ramirez brothers were also along.</s>
<s snum=103>The seventh man was Red Hogan, a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising.</s>
<s snum=104>They were all good men.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=105>It was dark early, because of the storm.</s>
<s snum=106>Also because of the storm, the streets of Rockfork were deserted.</s>
<s snum=107>Lighted windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour.</s>
<s snum=108>They reined in before the town marshal's office, a box-sized building on Main Street.</s>
<s snum=109>A lamp burned inside, but Brannon, peering through the window, saw that the office was empty.</s>
<s snum=110>He'd hoped to catch Jesse Macklin there.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=111>``Probably just stepped out'', he said.</s>
<s snum=112>``Maybe to have supper.</s>
<s snum=113>Red, come along.</s>
<s snum=114>The rest of you wait here''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=115>With Red Hogan, he rode to the Welcome Cafe.</s>
<s snum=116>Hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside.</s>
<s snum=117>``Not there'', he said, getting back onto his horse.</s>
<s snum=118>``Maybe he's at the hotel''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=119>They rode to the Rockfork House, a little farther along the opposite side of the street.</s>
<s snum=120>They reined in there, Brannon remaining in the saddle while Hogan went to look for Jesse Macklin in the hotel dining room.</s>
<s snum=121>Brannon had no slicker.</s>
<s snum=122>He'd put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked.</s>
<s snum=123>But he felt no physical discomfort.</s>
<s snum=124>He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain.</s>
<s snum=125>He hardly noticed the blue-green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=126>Hogan reappeared, stopped on the hotel porch, lifted a hand in signal.</s>
<s snum=127>Brannon dismounted and climbed the steps.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=128>``He's finished eating'', Hogan said.</s>
<s snum=129>``Sitting with a cup of coffee now.</s>
<s snum=130>It shouldn't be long''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=131>It seemed long, at least to Tom Brannon.</s>
<s snum=132>He and Hogan waited by the door, one to either side.</s>
<s snum=133>Macklin was the third man to come out, and he came unhurriedly.</s>
<s snum=134>He was puffing on a cigar, and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain.</s>
<s snum=135>It was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them, and then it was too late.</s>
<s snum=136>They closed in fast, kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=137>``Just come along'', Brannon told him.</s>
<s snum=138>``Don't start anything you can't finish''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=139>``Now, listen''- Macklin began.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=140>``We'll talk over at your office''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=141>``Brannon, I warn you''!</s>
<s snum=142>``Let's go, Marsh al'', Brannon said, and took him by the arm.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=143>Hogan gripped the lawman's other arm.</s>
<s snum=144>They escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office.</s>
<s snum=145>The other five Slash-B men followed them inside, crowding the small room.</s>
<s snum=146>His face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms.</s>
<s snum=147>He looked at each of them in turn, Brannon last of all.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=148>``I'll remember you'', he said.</s>
<s snum=149>``Every last one of you.</s>
<s snum=150>As for you, Brannon''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=151>``Put your gun on the desk, Marshal''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=152>``Now, hold on, damn it; I won't''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=153>Red Hogan's patience ran out.</s>
<s snum=154>He lifted the skirt of Macklin's coat, took his gun from its holster, tossed it onto the desk.</s>
<s snum=155>``Too much fooling around'', he said.</s>
<s snum=156>``Don't press your luck, badge-toter''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=157>Brannon said, ``Now the key to the lockup, Marshal''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=158>``Key''?</s>
<s snum=159>Macklin said.</s>
<s snum=160>``What for''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=161>``Can't you guess''?</s>
<s snum=162>Brannon said.</s>
<s snum=163>``We're putting you where you won't come to harm.</s>
<s snum=164>Come on- the key.</s>
<s snum=165>Get it out''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=166>``Damned if I will.</s>
<s snum=167>Brannon, you've assaulted a law officer and''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=168>They moved in on him, crowded him from all sides.</s>
<s snum=169>No man laid a hand on him, but the threat of violence was there.</s>
<s snum=170>His face took on a sudden pallor, became beaded with sweat, and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing.</s>
<s snum=171>He held out a moment longer, then his nerve gave under the pressure.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=172>He swore, and said, ``All right.</s>
<s snum=173>It's here in my pocket''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=174>``Get it out'', Brannon ordered.</s>
<s snum=175>Then, as Macklin obeyed: ``Now let's go out back''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=176>Resignedly, Macklin turned to the back door.</s>
<s snum=177>They followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear.</s>
<s snum=178>The door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron.</s>
<s snum=179>It was secured by an oversized padlock.</s>
<s snum=180>Macklin balked again, not wanting to unlock and open the door.</s>
<s snum=181>They crowded him in that threatening way once more, forced him to give in.</s>
<s snum=182>Once the door was open, they crowded him inside the dark building.</s>
<s snum=183>He was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=184>They returned to the street, mounted their horses, rode through the rain to the big house on Houston Street.</s>
<s snum=185>Its windows glowed with lamplight.</s>
<s snum=186>Deputy Marshal Luke Harper still stood guard on the veranda, a forlorn, scarecrowish figure in the murky dark.</s>
<s snum=187>He came to the edge of the veranda, peered down at them with his hand on his gun.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=188>``Don't try it'', Brannon told him, dismounting and starting up the steps with his men following.</s>
<s snum=189>``Don't get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=190>He strode past the now frightened man, entered the house.</s>
<s snum=191>Miguel and Arturo Ramirez remained on the veranda to keep Harper from interfering.</s>
<s snum=192>The others followed Brannon inside.</s>
<s snum=193>They trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor, four roughly garbed and tough-looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house.</s>
<s snum=194>They brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves, that of their own sweat, of campfire smoke, of horses and cattle.</s>
<s snum=195>They tracked mud on the oaken floor, on the carpet.</s>
<s snum=196>Their presence fouled the elegance of that room.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=197>And their arrival caught John Clayton and Charles Ansley off guard.</s>
