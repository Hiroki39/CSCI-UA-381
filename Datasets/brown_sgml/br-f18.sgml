<s snum=1>The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor.</s>
<s snum=2>Indeed, no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray.</s>
<s snum=3>Some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive.</s>
<s snum=4>A Confederate observed that the Yankees were: ``thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier''.</s>
<s snum=5>Another reported that his comrades were ``in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house''.</s>
<s snum=6>A third wrote that it was ``raining like poring peas on a rawhide''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression.</s>
<s snum=8>One wrote: ``[I am so hungry] I could eat a rider off his horse + snap at the stirups''.</s>
<s snum=9>A second reported that the dilapidated houses in Virginia ``look like the latter end of original sin and hard times''.</s>
<s snum=10>A third remarked of slowness of Southerners: ``They moved about from corner to corner, as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god''.</s>
<s snum=11>Still another, annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive, wrote: ``Yore letter was short and sweet, jist like a roasted maget''.</s>
<s snum=12>A Yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart: ``My girl is none of your one-horse girls.</s>
<s snum=13>She is a regular stub and twister, double geered.</s>
<s snum=14>She is well-educated and refined, all wildcat and fur, and Union from the muzzle to the crupper''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=15>Humor found many modes of expression.</s>
<s snum=16>A Texan wrote to a male companion at home: ``What has become of Halda and Laura?</s>
<s snum=17>When you see them again give them my love- not best respects now, but love by God''.</s>
<s snum=18>William R. Stillwell, an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the Georgia Department of Archives and History, liked to tease his wife in his letters.</s>
<s snum=19>After he had been away from home about a year he wrote: ``[Dear Wife] If I did not write and receive letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married I don't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as I am so forgitful''.</s>
<s snum=20>A Yank, disturbed by his increasing corpulence, wrote: ``I am growing so fat I am a burden 2 myself''.</s>
<s snum=21>Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer:</s>
<s snum=22>``Now I lay me down to sleep, The gray-backs o'er my body creep; If they should bite before I wake, I pray the Lord their jaws to break''``.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=23>Charles Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation, well-educated, and nearly fifty years of age.</s>
<s snum=24>But he was very much like his associates in his hatred of camp routine.</s>
<s snum=25>Near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups, name one of them ``fall-in'' and the other ``close-up'', and then shoot them both, ``and that will be the end of 'fall-in' and 'close-up'''.</s>

<p>
<s snum=26>The soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the Civil War armies were an earthy people.</s>
<s snum=27>They talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body.</s>
<s snum=28>One of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea.</s>
<s snum=29>Men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as ``looseness of the bowels''; but a much more common designation was ``the sh-ts''.</s>
<s snum=30>A Michigan soldier stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864: ``I expect to be tough as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts''.</s>
<s snum=31>Johnny Rebs from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the ``the Virginia quickstep''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=32>A Georgia soldier gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea: ``I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three days.</s>
<s snum=33>I eat too much eggs and poark it sowered [on] my stomack and turn loose on me''.</s>
<s snum=34>A Michigan soldier wrote his brother: ``I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear and I hope thease few lines find you the same''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>The letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances.</s>
<s snum=36>Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters, soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table.</s>
<s snum=37>Most of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp, on stumps, pieces of bark, drum heads, or the knee.</s>
<s snum=38>In the South, after the first year of the war, paper and ink were very poor.</s>
<s snum=39>Scarcity of paper caused many Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing, i.e., after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner, they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written.</s>
<s snum=40>Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads.</s>
<s snum=41>A Yank writing from Vicksburg, May 28, 1863, stated ``Not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced writing.</s>
<s snum=42>I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes, but we take no notice of them now''.</s>
<s snum=43>A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed his mother: ``I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often, for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter.</s>
<s snum=44>Just count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every time''.</s>
<s snum=45>Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta reported: ``The Yankees keep Shooting so I am afraid they will knock over my ink, so I will close''.</s>

<p>
<s snum=46>The most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives.</s>
<s snum=47>But fathers often addressed communications to their small children; and these, full of homely advice, are among the most human and revealing of Civil War letters.</s>
<s snum=48>Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro community.</s>
<s snum=49>Occasionally they would write to the slaves.</s>
<s snum=50>Early in the war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro ``body servants'' to perform the menial chores such as cooking, foraging, cleaning the quarters, shining shoes, and laundering clothes.</s>
<s snum=51>Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners' families.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>Unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home.</s>
<s snum=53>Owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19th-century America, these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=54>Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in Richmond, Petersburg, Washington, or Nashville.</s>
<s snum=55>But these comments are hardly printable.</s>
<s snum=56>An Alabama soldier whose feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements among the Virginia belles: ``They thout I was a saint.</s>
<s snum=57>I told them some sweet lies and they believed it all.</s>
<s snum=58>I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappies But I wold say I recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=59>Some of the letters were pungently expressive.</s>
<s snum=60>An Ohio soldier who, from a comrade just returned from leave, received an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister, took pen in hand and delivered himself thus: ``[Dear Sis] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy was a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse.</s>
<s snum=61>I think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as Alf dyer and let that orney thefin, drunkard, damed card playing Sun of a bich com to Sea you, the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode helion, he is too orney for hel.</s>
<s snum=62>i will Shute him as shore as i Sea him''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=63>Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions.</s>
<s snum=64>A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in Virginia: ``Dear Pa.</s>
<s snum=65>Went out a Skouting yesterday.</s>
<s snum=66>We got to one house where there were five secessionist they brok + run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches and we all let go at them.</s>
<s snum=67>Thay may say what they please but godamit Pa it is fun''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers.</s>
<s snum=69>A Mississippi soldier wrote: ``Our General Reub Davis is a vain, stuck-up, illiterate ass''.</s>
<s snum=70>An Alabamian wrote: ``Col. Henry is [an ignoramus] fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn''.</s>
<s snum=71>A Floridian stated that his officers were ``not fit to tote guts to a bear''.</s>
<s snum=72>On December 9, 1862, Sergeant Edwin H. Fay, an unusual Louisianan who held A.B. and M.A. degrees from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a private school for boys in Louisiana, wrote his wife:</s>
<s snum=73>``I saw Pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw.</s>
<s snum=74>His head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment, much less a corps.</s>
<s snum=75>Jackson runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader.</s>
<s snum=76>He is not worth shucks.</s>
<s snum=77>But he is a West Point graduate and therefore must be born to command''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>Similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers.</s>
<s snum=79>A Massachusetts soldier, who seems to have been a Civil War version of Bill Mauldin, wrote: ``The officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks.</s>
<s snum=80>They get all the glory and most of the pay and don't earn ten cents apiece on the average, the drunken rascals''.</s>
<s snum=81>Private George Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote: ``I am well convinced in My own Mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago''.</s>
<s snum=82>Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state: ``I wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against [the other half]''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=83>No group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors.</s>
<s snum=84>One Federal soldier wrote: ``The docters is no a conte.</s>
<s snum=85>hell will be filde with do[c]ters and offersey when this war is over''.</s>
<s snum=86>Shortly after the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign, an ailing Yank wrote his homefolk: ``The surgeon insisted on Sending me to the hospital for treatment.</s>
<s snum=87>I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed- thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than [by] Union quackery''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=88>The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling, from friendliness to extreme hatred.</s>
<s snum=89>The Rebs were, to a Massachusetts corporal, ``fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey + gunpowder put into a human frame''.</s>
<s snum=90>A Pennsylvania soldier wrote that ``they were the hardest looking set of men that Ever i saw they Looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings''.</s>
<s snum=91>Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote in his diary: ``I strolled among the Alabamans on the right, found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect 'They Recooned as how you'uns all would be a heap wus to we'uns all'''.</s>
<s snum=92>In a similar vein, but writing from the opposite side, Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6th Alabama Volunteers, in a letter to his wife, stated: ``You know that my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe By a set of cowardly Skunks whose Motto is Booty.</s>
