<p>
<s snum=1>In the midwest, oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas.</s>
<s snum=2>The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=3>Research at Fayette, Missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the ~BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 ~mg/~l with loadings from 8 to 120 ~lb ~BOD/day/acre.</s>
<s snum=4>Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these ~BOD concentrations, the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds.</s>
<s snum=5>Recent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer.</s>
<s snum=6>Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 ~lb of oxygen/~hr/~hp.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes.</s>
<s snum=8>They indicated that a 4-day retention, aerated lagoon would give 60to 76 per cent ~BOD reduction.</s>
<s snum=9>Later, Eckenfelder increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer months.</s>
<s snum=10>It appeared from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume.</s>
</p>
<hl>RED BRIDGE SUBDIVISION</hl>
<p>
<s snum=11>With the development of the Red Bridge Subdivision south of Kansas City, Missouri, the developer was faced with the problem of providing adequate sewage disposal.</s>
<s snum=12>The sewage system from Kansas City was not expected to serve the Red Bridge area for several years.</s>
<s snum=13>This necessitated the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 ~yr.</s>
<s snum=14>For the initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in Figure 1.</s>
<s snum=15>The oxidation pond has a surface area of 4.77 acres and a depth of 4 ~ft.</s>
<s snum=16>The pond is currently serving 1,230 persons or 260 persons per acre.</s>
<s snum=17>In the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors.</s>
<s snum=18>It was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the pond by regular additions of sodium nitrate until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from blue-green to green algae.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>The anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium nitrate.</s>
<s snum=20>At the same time further expansion in the Red Bridge Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities.</s>
<s snum=21>The large land areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer.</s>
<s snum=22>It was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development.</s>
</p>
<hl>PILOT LAGOON</hl>
<p>
<s snum=23>The lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treating domestic sewage.</s>
<s snum=24>The pilot plant was a circular lagoon 81 ~ft in ~diam at the surface and 65 ~ft in ~diam at the bottom, 4 ~ft below the surface, with a volume of 121,000 ~gal.</s>
<s snum=25>The side slopes were coated with fiberglas matting coated with asphalt to prevent erosion.</s>
<s snum=26>The pilot lagoon was located as shown in Figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area.</s>
<s snum=27>The major contributor was a shopping center with houses being added to the system as the subdivision developed.</s>
<s snum=28>The pilot lagoon was designed to handle the wastes from 314 persons with a 4-day aeration period.</s>
<s snum=29>Initially, the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18-month period.</s>
<s snum=30>This operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant, with a slowly increasing load, over a reasonable period of time.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=31>The pilot plant was equipped with a 3-~hp turbine aerator (Figure 2).</s>
<s snum=32>The aerator had a variable-speed drive to permit operation through a range of speeds.</s>
<s snum=33>The sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and continuously recorded on 24-~hr charts.</s>
<s snum=34>The raw sewage was introduced directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank contents.</s>
<s snum=35>The effluent was collected through two pipes and discharged to the Blue River through a surface drainage ditch.</s>
</p>
<hl>ANALYSES</hl>
<p>
<s snum=36>Composite samples were collected at weekly intervals.</s>
<s snum=37>The long retention period and the complete mixing concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent.</s>
<s snum=38>Weekly samples would make any changes more readily discernible than daily samples.</s>
<s snum=39>The composite samples were normally collected over a 6-~hr period, but an occasional 24-~hr composite was made.</s>
<s snum=40>Examination of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation of the 6-~hr composite samples with 24-~hr operations.</s>
<s snum=41>The data indicated that the organic load during the 6-~hr composites was essentially 50 per cent of the 24-~hr organic load.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=42>Grab samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions.</s>
<s snum=43>Efforts were made to take the grab samples at random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6-~hr composite sample.</s>
<s snum=44>A single 24-~hr composite sample indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical.</s>
</p>
<hl>PILOT PLANT OPERATIONS</hl>
<p>
<s snum=45>The ~BOD of the influent to the pilot plant varied between 110 and 710 ~mg/~l with an average of 350 ~mg/~l.</s>
<s snum=46>This was equivalent to 240 ~mg/~l~BOD on a 24-~hr basis.</s>
<s snum=47>The ~BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision.</s>
<s snum=48>The ~BOD in the effluent averaged 58 ~mg/~l, a 76-per cent reduction over the 24-~hr period.</s>
<s snum=49>Examination of the data in Table /1, shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent ~BOD.</s>
<s snum=50>The periods of high effluent ~BOD occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted.</s>
<s snum=51>Ice caused the aerator to overload, straining the drive belts.</s>
<s snum=52>The slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>The organic loading on the unit averaged 32 ~lb of ~BOD/day or about 2 ~lb ~BOD/day/1,000 ~cu ~ft aeration capacity.</s>
<s snum=54>Needless to say, the organic load was very low on a volumetric basis, but was 270 ~lb ~BOD/day/acre on a surface loading basis.</s>
<s snum=55>It seems that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=56>The flow rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in Table /1,.</s>
<s snum=57>With the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open sewers.</s>
<s snum=58>As construction progresses, the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduced.</s>
<s snum=59>The retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged from 9.8 to 2.6days, averaging 6.4 days.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=60>The large amount of vegetable grindings from the grocery store in the shopping center created a suspended solids problem.</s>
<s snum=61>The vegetables were not readily metabolized by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to float on the surface.</s>
<s snum=62>A skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of most of these light solids.</s>
<s snum=63>The average volatile suspended solids in the effluent was 75 ~mg/~l while ~MLSS averaged 170 ~mg/~l volatile suspended solids.</s>
<s snum=64>The average sludge age based on displacement of solids was calculated to be 14.5 days.</s>
<s snum=65>The oxygen uptake rate in the mixed liquor averaged 0.8 ~mg/~l/~hr during the first four months of this study.</s>
<s snum=66>Variations in aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen demand.</s>
<s snum=67>The increase in oxygen uptake rates from 1.2to 2.6 ~mg/~l/~hr which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to be related to resuspension of solids which had settled at the lower rotor speeds.</s>
<s snum=68>It appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids were active microbial solids with the heavier, less active solids settling out.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=69>The suspended solids discharged in the effluent were found to be the major source of the ~BOD.</s>
<s snum=70>Removal of the suspended solids by a membrane filter yielded an average effluent containing only 20 ~mg/~l ~BOD.</s>
<s snum=71>The ~BOD in the drainage ditch receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 ~mg/~l.</s>
<s snum=72>This low ~BOD was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during this study.</s>
</p>
<hl>MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION</hl>
<p>
<s snum=73>Routine microscopic examinations were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by McKinney and Gram for the various types of protozoa.</s>
<s snum=74>It was found that the aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation pond.</s>
<s snum=75>At no time were algae found in the mixed liquor.</s>
<s snum=76>The bacteria formed typical activated sludge floc.</s>
<s snum=77>The floc particles were all small as the heavier floc settled out.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>Initially, the flagellated protozoa predominated, but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated protozoa.</s>
<s snum=79>As the temperature decreased, the number of free swimming ciliated protozoa decreased.</s>
<s snum=80>Very little protozoa activity existed below 40`~F.</s>
<s snum=81>When the temperature reached 32`~F all protozoan activity ceased; but as the temperature rose, the numbers of protozoa increased rapidly.</s>
<s snum=82>Only once were stalked ciliates found in the mixed liquor.</s>
<s snum=83>The predomination of free swimming ciliated protozoa is indicative of a high bacterial population.</s>
</p>
<hl>OXYGEN TRANSFER</hl>
<p>
<s snum=84>One of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator.</s>
<s snum=85>Routine determinations were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates.</s>
<s snum=86>The data given in Table /2, show the routine operation of the aerator.</s>
<s snum=87>The dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently high until January 29, 1961.</s>
<s snum=88>An extended cold spell caused ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water.</s>
<s snum=89>The added resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity.</s>
<s snum=90>It was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and corrected, but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=91>A series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate.</s>
<s snum=92>Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover.</s>
<s snum=93>The rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0-~mg/~l dissolved oxygen concentration and 10`~C for various rotor speeds is given in Table /3,.</s>
<s snum=94>The maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 ~mg/~l dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 ~lb/day at a maximum rate of 9.3 ~mg/~l/~hr.</s>
<s snum=95>The actual power requirements indicated 2~lb oxygen transfer/~hr/~hp.</s>
<s snum=96>The polyethylene cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent, indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface.</s>
</p>
<hl>OXIDATION POND</hl>
<p>
<s snum=97>During this study septic conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted.</s>
<s snum=98>Shortly after this study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of sodium nitrate.</s>
<s snum=99>The location of the oxidation pond in a high-value residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer.</s>
<s snum=100>The organic concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from 160 to 270 ~mg/~l of ~BOD with an average of 230 ~mg/~l.</s>
<s snum=101>The ~BOD data are given in Table /4,.</s>
<s snum=102>A single 24-~hr composite sample had a ~BOD of 260~mg/~l, indicating a typical domestic sewage.</s>
<s snum=103>The daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged 147,000~gpd, giving a retention period of 42 days.</s>
<s snum=104>The organic loading on the pond was slightly under 60~lb~BOD/day/acre.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=105>The effluent ~BOD averaged 34 ~mg/~l, a little lower than that of the study at Fayette indicated for a loading of 60~lb ~BOD/day/acre.</s>
<s snum=106>The ~BOD of the effluent ranged from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47~mg/~l.</s>
<s snum=107>Microscopic examination of the effluent showed that minimum ~BOD occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold weather.</s>
<s snum=108>When the algae began to build up again, the effluent ~BOD rose.</s>
<s snum=109>During the two weeks when the algae disappeared from the effluent ~BOD's in the effluent were 18 and 16 ~mg/~l.</s>
