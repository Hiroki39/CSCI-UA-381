<s snum=1>Nothing like Godot, he arrived before the hour.</s>
<s snum=2>His letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday, and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve.</s>
<s snum=3>He was waiting.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=4>My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work.</s>
<s snum=5>American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic.</s>
<s snum=6>They find deep pessimism in them.</s>
<s snum=7>Even so astute a commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said that ``Waiting for Godot'' is ``the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair''.</s>
<s snum=8>But to me Beckett's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism.</s>
<s snum=9>Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me?</s>
<s snum=10>Is his a literature of defeat, irrelevant to the social crises we face?</s>
<s snum=11>Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions, because a man is not the same as his writing: in the last analysis, the questions had to be settled by the work itself.</s>
<s snum=13>Nevertheless I was curious.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=14>My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature, a Jesuit father, at a conference on religious drama near Paris.</s>
<s snum=15>When Beckett's name came into the discussion, the priest grew loud and told me that Beckett ``hates life''.</s>
<s snum=16>That, I thought, is at least one thing I can find out when we meet.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=17>Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish.</s>
<s snum=18>The features of his face are distinct, but not fine.</s>
<s snum=19>They look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel.</s>
<s snum=20>Unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead, standing so high that the top falls gently over, as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle.</s>
<s snum=21>One might say it combines the man; own pride and humility.</s>
<s snum=22>For he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility, perhaps of the same genesis, not to impose himself upon another.</s>
<s snum=23>His light blue eyes, set deep within the face, are actively and continually looking.</s>
<s snum=24>He seems, by some unconscious division of labor, to have given them that one function and no other, leaving communication to the rest of the face.</s>
<s snum=25>The mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile.</s>
<s snum=26>The voice is light in timbre, with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage.</s>
<s snum=27>The Irish accent is, as one would expect, combined with slight inflections from the French.</s>
<s snum=28>His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green.</s>
<s snum=29>He wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>We walked down the Rue de L'Arcade, thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church.</s>
<s snum=31>The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering.</s>
<s snum=32>For one thing, the world that Beckett sees is already shattered.</s>
<s snum=33>His talk turns to what he calls ``the mess'', or sometimes ``this buzzing confusion''.</s>
<s snum=34>I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation.</s>
<s snum=35>What appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=36>``The confusion is not my invention.</s>
<s snum=37>We cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion.</s>
<s snum=38>It is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in.</s>
<s snum=39>The only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess.</s>
<s snum=40>It is not a mess you can make sense of''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=41>I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth, but Beckett did not take to the word truth.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=42>``What is more true than anything else?</s>
<s snum=43>To swim is true, and to sink is true.</s>
<s snum=44>One is not more true than the other.</s>
<s snum=45>One cannot speak anymore of being, one must speak only of the mess.</s>
<s snum=46>When Heidegger and Sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence, they may be right, I don't know, but their language is too philosophical for me.</s>
<s snum=47>I am not a philosopher.</s>
<s snum=48>One can only speak of what is in front of him, and that now is simply the mess''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>Then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form.</s>
<s snum=50>Until recently, art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things.</s>
<s snum=51>It has held them at bay.</s>
<s snum=52>It realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form.</s>
<s snum=53>``How could the mess be admitted, because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be''?</s>
<s snum=54>But now we can keep it out no longer, because we have come into a time when ``it invades our experience at every moment.</s>
<s snum=55>It is there and it must be allowed in''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=56>I granted this might be so, but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously.</s>
<s snum=57>And why not?</s>
<s snum=58>How, I asked, could chaos be admitted to chaos?</s>
<s snum=59>Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art?</s>
<s snum=60>If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form.</s>
<s snum=61>Beckett's own work is an example.</s>
<s snum=62>Plays more highly formalized than ``Waiting for Godot'', ``Endgame'', and ``Krapp's Last Tape'' would be hard to find.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=63>``What I am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art.</s>
<s snum=64>It only means that there will be new form, and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else.</s>
<s snum=65>The form and the chaos remain separate.</s>
<s snum=66>The latter is not reduced to the former.</s>
<s snum=67>That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation, because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates.</s>
<s snum=68>To find a form that accommodates the mess, that is the task of the artist now''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=69>Yet, I responded, could not similar things be said about the art of the past?</s>
<s snum=70>Is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify, demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable way?</s>
<s snum=71>What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory?</s>
<s snum=72>Isn't all art ambiguous?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=73>``Not this'', he said, and gestured toward the Madeleine.</s>
<s snum=74>The classical lines of the church which Napoleon thought of as a Temple of Glory, dominated all the scene where we sat.</s>
<s snum=75>The Boulevard de la Madeleine, the Boulevard Malesherbes, and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful flattery, bearing tidings of the Age of Reason.</s>
<s snum=76>``Not this.</s>
<s snum=77>This is clear.</s>
<s snum=78>This does not allow the mystery to invade us.</s>
<s snum=79>With classical art, all is settled.</s>
<s snum=80>But it is different at Chartres.</s>
<s snum=81>There is the unexplainable, and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>I asked about the battle between life and death in his plays.</s>
<s snum=83>Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide; Hamm's world is death and Clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside.</s>
<s snum=84>Is this life-death question a part of the chaos?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=85>``Yes.</s>
<s snum=86>If life and death did not both present themselves to us, there would be no inscrutability.</s>
<s snum=87>If there were only darkness, all would be clear.</s>
<s snum=88>It is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable.</s>
<s snum=89>Take Augustine's doctrine of grace given and grace withheld: have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology?</s>
<s snum=90>Two thieves are crucified with Christ, one saved and the other damned.</s>
<s snum=91>How can we make sense of this division?</s>
<s snum=92>In classical drama, such problems do not arise.</s>
<s snum=93>The destiny of Racine's Phedre is sealed from the beginning: she will proceed into the dark.</s>
<s snum=94>As she goes, she herself will be illuminated.</s>
<s snum=95>At the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination, but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark.</s>
<s snum=96>That is the play.</s>
<s snum=97>Within this notion clarity is possible, but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist there is not such clarity.</s>
<s snum=98>The question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary- total salvation.</s>
<s snum=99>But where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable.</s>
<s snum=100>The key word in my plays is 'perhaps'''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=101>Given a theological lead, I asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=102>``Well, really there is none at all.</s>
<s snum=103>I have no religious feeling.</s>
<s snum=104>Once I had a religious emotion.</s>
<s snum=105>It was at my first Communion.</s>
<s snum=106>No more.</s>
<s snum=107>My mother was deeply religious.</s>
<s snum=108>So was my brother.</s>
<s snum=109>He knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel.</s>
<s snum=110>My father had none.</s>
<s snum=111>The family was Protestant, but for me it was only irksome and I let it go.</s>
<s snum=112>My brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died.</s>
<s snum=113>At the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old-school tie.</s>
<s snum=114>Irish Catholicism is not attractive, but it is deeper.</s>
<s snum=115>When you pass a church on an Irish bus, all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross.</s>
<s snum=116>One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>But do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=118>``Yes, for they deal with distress.</s>
<s snum=119>Some people object to this in my writing.</s>
<s snum=120>At a party an English intellectual- so-called- asked me why I write always about distress.</s>
<s snum=121>As if it were perverse to do so!</s>
<s snum=122>He wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood.</s>
<s snum=123>I told him no, that I had had a very happy childhood.</s>
<s snum=124>Then he thought me more perverse than ever.</s>
<s snum=125>I left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi.</s>
<s snum=126>On the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs:</s>
<s snum=127>one asked for help for the blind, another help for orphans, and the third for relief for the war refugees.</s>
<s snum=128>One does not have to look for distress.</s>
<s snum=129>It is screaming at you even in the taxis of London''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=130>Lunch was over, and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming at us.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=131>The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar to qualities I had found in the plays.</s>
<s snum=132>He says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern.</s>
<s snum=133>``Perhaps'' stands in place of commitment.</s>
<s snum=134>At the same time, he is plainly sympathetic, clearly friendly.</s>
<s snum=135>If there were only the mess, all would be clear; but there is also compassion.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=136>As a Christian, I know I do not stand where Beckett stands, but I do see much of what he sees.</s>
<s snum=137>As a writer on the theater, I have paid close attention to the plays.</s>
<s snum=138>Harold Clurman is right to say that ``Waiting for Godot'' is a reflection (he calls it a distorted reflection) ``of the impasse and disarray of Europe's present politics, ethic, and common way of life''.</s>
<s snum=139>Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to.</s>
<s snum=140>``Waiting for Godot'' sells even better in America than in France.</s>
<s snum=141>The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America, but it is the consciousness that most ``mature'' societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture.</s>
<s snum=142>America is now joining Europe in this ``mature'' phase of development.</s>
<s snum=143>Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of Asia and Africa, and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold.</s>
