</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset at the Salvation Army's Social Center at 1200 Larimer st..</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=31>The pert, gray-haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo, N.Y., is a ``civilian'' with the Army.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=32>Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director.</s>
<s snum=33>The job also covers a number of other items.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=34>``Mom'' Marr, as the more than 80 men at the center call her, is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>Her day starts early, but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written (and during May, which is National Salvation Army Week, there are plenty), schedules to be made or problems to be solved, Mrs.Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is out.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=36>MRS. Marr is the first contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=37>She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=38>``Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men'', Mrs. Marr explained.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=39>The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=40>``And I bum tickets to everything I can'', she said.</s>
<s snum=41>``I've become the greatest beggar in the world''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=42>In addition to the tickets to the movies, sporting events and concerts, Mrs. Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=43>Mrs. Marr also has a number of parolees to ``mother'', watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=44>By mid-June, millions of Americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=45>In another four weeks, with schools closed across the nation, the great all-American summer safari will be under way.</s>
<s snum=46>By July 1, six weeks from now, motel-keepers all over the nation will, by 6 p.m., be switching on that bleak- to motorists- sign, ``No Vacancy''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=47>No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer, probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car, throw suitcases, kids and comic books in the back seat, and head for home.</s>
<s snum=48>And where is ``home'', that magic place of the heart?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>Ah, that is simple.</s>
<s snum=50>Home is where a man was born, reared, went to school and, most particularly, where grandma is.</s>
<s snum=51>That is where we turn in the good old summertime.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>The land lies ready for the coming onslaught.</s>
<s snum=53>My husband and I, a month ahead of the rush, have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson, Ariz., to New York City.</s>
</p>
<hl>SET FOR INFLUX</hl>
<p>
<s snum=54>I can testify that motels, service and comfort stations (they go together like Scots and heather), dog wagons, roadside restaurants, souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=55>I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene, such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent, far-flung over-night accommodations.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=56>Maybe motel-keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry, but it certainly looks that way from the highway.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=57>There are motels for all purposes and all tastes.</s>
<s snum=58>There are even motels for local weather peculiarities, as I discovered in Shamrock, Tex..</s>
<s snum=59>There the Royal Motel advertises ``all facilities, vented heat, air conditioned, carpeted, free ~TV, storm cellar''.</s>
</p>
<hl>MANY WITH POOLS</hl>
<p>
<s snum=60>Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools (``swim at your own risk'' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools).</s>
<s snum=61>Some even boast two pools, one for adults and one for children.</s>
<s snum=62>But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=63>Motorists like myself who can remember the old ``tourists accommodated'' signs on farm houses and village homes before World War /2, can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business.</s>
</p>
<hl>ALL FOR $14!</hl>
<p>
<s snum=64>At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester, Va., we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite, an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting, gold and white furniture, pink satin brocade chairs, 24-inch ~TV and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels.</s>
<s snum=65>All for $14.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=66>That made up for the ``best'' motel in Norman, Okla., where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture.</s>
</p>
