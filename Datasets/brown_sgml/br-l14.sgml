<s snum=1>A man with a sketch pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long, dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper and said, ``Is this more like it, Mrs. MacReady?</s>
<s snum=2>Or are the eyebrows more like this''?</s>
<s snum=3>When he had finished with that, he would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to someone else, most probably a busboy.</s>
<s snum=4>``Begin to look like him now, would you say?</s>
<s snum=5>Different about the mouth, huh?</s>
<s snum=6>More like this, maybe''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>Men blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth floor of the Hotel Dumont and blew it off again, and did the same in a tiny, almost airless room in a tenement in the West Forties.</s>
<s snum=8>And men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms, sucking dust up once more.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=9>Men from the Third Detective District, Eighteenth Precinct, had the longest, the most tedious, job.</s>
<s snum=10>At the Hotel Dumont there had, at the time in issue, been twenty-three overnighters, counting couples as singular.</s>
<s snum=11>These included, as one, Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Payne, who had checked in a little after noon the day before, and had not checked out together.</s>
<s snum=12>But Gardner Willings was not included; he had been at the Dumont for almost a week.</s>
<s snum=13>There was, of course, no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed only overnight at the hotel.</s>
<s snum=14>The twenty-three (or twenty-two with the Paynes themselves omitted) provided merely a place to start, and their identification was the barest of starts.</s>
<s snum=15>With names and addresses listed, verification came next.</s>
<s snum=16>It would take time; it would, almost inevitably, trouble some water.</s>
<s snum=17>(``I certainly was not at the Dumont last night and my husband couldn't have been.</s>
<s snum=18>He's in Boston.</s>
<s snum=19>Of course he's in''-)</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=20>The Hotel King Arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems.</s>
<s snum=21>The King Arthur offered respectable and convenient lodgings to people from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didn't want- heaven knew didn't want!</s>
<s snum=22>- to lunge anxiously through crowded streets to railroad stations and, at odd hours of night, drive from smaller stations to distant homes, probably through rain or, in November, something worse.</s>
<s snum=23>The King Arthur was less expensive than the Dumont.</s>
<s snum=24>The King Arthur had fifty-four overnighters, again counting rooms rather than people.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=25>Check the overnighters out.</s>
<s snum=26>Failing to find what was wanted, as was most likely, check out other guests, with special- but not exclusive- attention to those with rooms on the street.</s>
<s snum=27>(Anyone active enough can reach a roof, wherever his room may be.)</s>
<s snum=28> And know, while all this went on, that there was no real reason to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel.</s>
<s snum=29>It was not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel.</s>
<s snum=30>There were other roofs, less convenient but not impossible.</s>
<s snum=31>It is dull business, detecting, and hard on feet.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=32>There was also the one salient question to ask, and ask widely: Did you notice anything out of the way?</s>
<s snum=33>Like, for example, a man carrying a twenty-two rifle, probably with a telescopic sight attached?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=34>There was, of course, no hope it really would be that simple.</s>
<s snum=35>The sniper, whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent, would hardly have walked to his vantage point with rifle over shoulder, whistling a marching tune.</s>
<s snum=36>Anybody carrying anything that might hide a rifle?</s>
<s snum=37>Long thin suitcase?</s>
<s snum=38>Or long fat suitcase, for that matter?</s>
<s snum=39>Shrugs met that, from room clerks, from bellhops.</s>
<s snum=40>Who measures?</s>
<s snum=41>But nothing, it appeared, long enough to attract attention.</s>
<s snum=42>Cases, say, for musical instruments?</s>
<s snum=43>None noted at the Dumont.</s>
<s snum=44>Several at the King Arthur.</s>
<s snum=45>A combo was staying there.</s>
<s snum=46>And had been for a week.</s>
<s snum=47>Anything else?</s>
<s snum=48>Anything at all?</s>
<s snum=49>Shrugs met that.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=50>(Detective Pearson, Eighteenth Precinct, thought for a time he might be on to something.</s>
<s snum=51>A refuse bin at the Dumont turned up a florist's box- a very long box for very long-stemmed flowers.</s>
<s snum=52>Traces of oil on green tissue?</s>
<s snum=53>The lab to check.</s>
<s snum=54>The lab: Sorry.</s>
<s snum=55>No oil.)</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=56>Anything at all strange?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=57>Well, a man had tried, at the King Arthur, to register with an ocelot.</s>
<s snum=58>At the Dumont, a guest had come in a collapsible wheel chair.</s>
<s snum=59>At the King Arthur one guest had had his head heavily bandaged, and another had a bandaged foot and had walked with crutches.</s>
<s snum=60>There had also been a man who must have had St. Vitus or something, because he kept jerking his head.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=61>As reports dribbled in, William Weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head.</s>
<s snum=62>Mullins came in.</s>
<s snum=63>There was no sign of Mrs. Lauren Payne at her house on Nod Road, Ridgefield, Connecticut.</s>
<s snum=64>The house was modern, large, on five acres.</s>
<s snum=65>Must have cost plenty.</s>
<s snum=66>The State cops would check from time to time; pass word when there was word to pass.</s>
<s snum=67>Weigand tossed this news into the centrifuge.</s>
<s snum=68>Sort things out, damn it.</s>
<s snum=69>Sort out the next move.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=70>Try to forget motive for the moment.</s>
<s snum=71>Consider opportunity.</s>
<s snum=72>Only those actually with Payne when he was shot, or who had left the party within not more than five minutes (make five arbitrary) positively had none.</s>
<s snum=73>The Norths; Hathaway, Jerry's publicity director; Livingston Birdwood, producer of Uprising.</s>
<s snum=74>They had been with Payne when he was shot, could not therefore have shot him from above.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>Take Gardner Willings.</s>
<s snum=76>He had left after the scuffle; had been seen to leave.</s>
<s snum=77>He would have had ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey.</s>
<s snum=78>Consider him seriously, therefore?</s>
<s snum=79>Intangibles entered, then- hunches which felt like facts.</s>
<s snum=80>Willings would ambush, certainly; Willings undoubtedly had.</s>
<s snum=81>Willings was, presumably, a better than average shot.</s>
<s snum=82>But- hunch, now- Willings would not ambush anything which went on two legs instead of four.</s>
<s snum=83>Because, if for no other reason, Willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger, tougher, than anything else that went on two legs.</s>
<s snum=84>Ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves, as any man may against a tiger.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=85>Faith Constable had had to ``go on'' from the party and had, presumably, gone on.</s>
<s snum=86>To be checked out further.</s>
<s snum=87>Forget motive?</s>
<s snum=88>No, motive is a part of fact.</s>
<s snum=89>Nobody in his right mind punishes a quarter-century-old dereliction.</s>
<s snum=90>Grudges simply do not keep that well in a sane mind.</s>
<s snum=91>Faith Constable had accomplished much in a quarter of a century.</s>
<s snum=92>Jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong?</s>
<s snum=93>Bill shook his head.</s>
<s snum=94>Also, he thought, I doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=95>Lauren herself?</s>
<s snum=96>She had left the party early, pleading a headache.</s>
<s snum=97>No lack of opportunity, presuming she had a gun.</s>
<s snum=98>She might, conceivably, have brought one in in a large-enough suitcase.</s>
<s snum=99>(Check on the Payne luggage.)</s>
<s snum=100>She might now have taken it away again.</s>
<s snum=101>Motive- her husband wandering?</s>
<s snum=102>Bitter, unreasoning jealousy?</s>
<s snum=103>Heaven knew it happened and hell knew it too.</s>
<s snum=104>But- it happened, almost always, among the primitive and, usually, among the very young.</s>
<s snum=105>(Call it mentally young; call it retarded.)</s>
<s snum=106>There was nothing to indicate that Lauren Payne was primitive.</s>
<s snum=107>She did not move in primitive circles.</s>
<s snum=108>She was young, but not that young.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=109>It occurred to Bill Weigand that he was, on a hunch basis, eliminating a good many.</s>
<s snum=110>He reminded himself that all eliminations were tentative.</s>
<s snum=111>He also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=112>The Masons, mother or son, or mother and son?</s>
<s snum=113>Opportunity was obvious.</s>
<s snum=114>Motive.</s>
<s snum=115>Here, too, the cause to hate lay well back in the years.</s>
<s snum=116>But bitterness had more cause to remain, even increasingly to corrode.</s>
<s snum=117>With the boy, particularly.</s>
<s snum=118>The boy had, apparently- if Mrs. MacReady was right in what she had told Mullins- only in recent months been forced to give up college, to work as a busboy.</s>
<s snum=119>Seeing the man he blamed for this made much of- youth and bitterness and- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=120>Bill picked up the telephone; got Mullins.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=121>``Send out a pickup on Mrs. Mason and the boy when you've got enough to go on'', Bill said.</s>
<s snum=122>``Right''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=123>Mullins would do.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=124>A man named Lars Simon, playwright-director, had expressed a wish that Anthony Payne drop dead.</s>
<s snum=125>He would say, of course, that he had not really had any such wish; that what he had said was no more than one of those things one does say, lightly, meaning nothing.</s>
<s snum=126>Which probably would turn out to be true; which he obviously had to be given the opportunity to say.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=127>A man named Blaine Smythe, with ``~y'' and ``~e'' but pronounced without them, had been fired at Payne's insistence.</s>
<s snum=128>He was also, if Pam North was right, a closer acquaintance of Lauren Payne's than she, now, was inclined to admit.</s>
<s snum=129>He might deny the latter; would certainly deny any connection between the two things, or any connection of either with murder.</s>
<s snum=130>He would have to be given the opportunity.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=131>Mullins?</s>
<s snum=132>It was evident that Mullins was the man to go.</s>
<s snum=133>It was evident that a captain should remain at his desk, directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat.</s>
<s snum=134>Bill Weigand was good and tired of the wall opposite, and the crack in the plaster.</s>
<s snum=135>Let Mullins keep the firm seat; let Stein.</s>
</p>

<p>
<s snum=136>When Siamese cats are intertwined it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and another begins.</s>
<s snum=137>Stilts and Shadow, on Pam's bed, appeared to be one cat- rather large, as Siamese cats go, and, to be sure, having two heads and two tails.</s>
<s snum=138>On the other hand, they, or it, seemed to have no legs whatever.</s>
<s snum=139>Pamela North said, ``Hi'', to her cats, and added that proper cats met their humans at the door.</s>
<s snum=140>Of four dark brown ears, one twitched slightly at this.</s>
<s snum=141>``All right'', Pam said.</s>
<s snum=142>``I know it isn't dinnertime''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=143>But at this the one too-large cat suddenly became two cats, stretching.</s>
<s snum=144>Shadow, the more talkative, began at once to talk, her voice piteous.</s>
<s snum=145>Stilts, a more direct cat, leaped from the bed and trotted briskly toward the kitchen.</s>
<s snum=146>Shadow looked surprised, wailed, and trotted after her.</s>
<s snum=147>The hell it isn't dinnertime, two waving tails told Pam North.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=148>It was not, whatever tale was told by tails.</s>
<s snum=149>Martha presumably would cope.</s>
<s snum=150>She might be firm.</s>
<s snum=151>It was most unlikely that she would be firm.</s>
<s snum=152>They want to be fat cats, Pam thought, and lighted a cigarette and leaned back on a chaise and considered pulling her thoughts together.</s>
<s snum=153>After a time, it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble.</s>
<s snum=154>A vague feeling that Anthony Payne had had it coming was hardly a thought and was, in any event, reprehensible.</s>
<s snum=155>Had Faith Constable's explanation of her confidence, so uninvited, been a little thin?</s>
<s snum=156>That was more like a thought, but not a great deal more.</s>
<s snum=157>Had that tall dark boy, carrying trays too heavy for him, found what he might have considered adulation of a man he probably hated more than he could bear?</s>
<s snum=158>And possessed himself- how?</s>
<s snum=159>- of a rifle and killed?</s>
<s snum=160>Pam found she had no answers; had only a hope.</s>
<s snum=161>The poor kid- the poor, frail kid.</s>
<s snum=162>Some people have luck and some have no luck and that, whatever people who prefer order say, is the size of it.</s>
<s snum=163>The poor, unlucky- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=164>The telephone rang.</s>
<s snum=165>Pam realized, to her surprise, that she had been almost dozing.</s>
<s snum=166>At four o'clock in the afternoon.</s>
<s snum=167>Two martinis for lunch- that was the trouble.</s>
<s snum=168>I ought to remember.</s>
<s snum=169>Don't pretend.</s>
<s snum=170>You do remember.</s>
<s snum=171>You just- ``Hello?</s>
<s snum=172>Yes, this is she?</s>
<s snum=173>What''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=174>The voice had music in it.</s>
<s snum=175>Even with words coming too fast, they came on the music of the voice.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=176>``I said I would'', Pam said.</s>
<s snum=177>``They won't talk about who gave the information.</s>
<s snum=178>Not unless they have to.</s>
<s snum=179>They don't, Mrs. Constable.</s>
<s snum=180>Not unless they have''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=181>She was interrupted.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=182>``Call this a cry for help'', Faith Constable said.</s>
