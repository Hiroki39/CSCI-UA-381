<p>
<s snum=1>On April 17, 1610, the sturdy little three-masted bark, Discovery, weighed anchor in St. Katherine's Pool, London, and floated down the Thames toward the sea.</s>
<s snum=2>She carried, besides her captain, a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North America.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=3>Seventeen months later, on September 6, 1611, an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay.</s>
<s snum=4>When she reached port, she was found to have on board only eight men, all near starvation.</s>
<s snum=5>The captain was gone, and the mate was gone.</s>
<s snum=6>The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months?</s>
<s snum=8>What happened to the fourteen missing men?</s>
<s snum=9>These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time.</s>
<s snum=10>For hundreds of years, the evidence available consisted of (1) the captain's fragmentary journal, (2) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors, (3) a note found in a dead man's desk on board, and (4) several second-hand reports.</s>
<s snum=11>All told, they offered a highly confused picture.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>But since 1927, researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information.</s>
<s snum=13>Not enough to do away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=14>Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations.</s>
<s snum=15>First, they wanted to clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma.</s>
<s snum=16>Second, they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps, on American towns and counties, on a great American river, and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=17>The name: Henry Hudson.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=18>This is the story of his last tragic voyage, as nearly as we are able- or ever, probably, will be able- to determine:</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years.</s>
<s snum=20>Each time his objective had been the same- a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far East.</s>
<s snum=21>In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole or across the top of Russia.</s>
<s snum=22>Twice he had failed, and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=23>In 1609, the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson, gave him two learned geographers, fitted him out with a ship called the Half Moon, and supplied him with Dutch sailors.</s>
<s snum=24>This time he turned westward, to the middle Atlantic coast of North America.</s>
<s snum=25>His chief discovery was important- the Great North (later, the Hudson)River- but it produced no northwest passage.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth, England, in the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings leaked out, and English interest in him revived.</s>
<s snum=27>The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship.</s>
<s snum=28>He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth.</s>
<s snum=29>By springtime, he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry, Prince of Wales.</s>
<s snum=30>He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one, the largest he had ever commanded.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=31>The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear.</s>
<s snum=32>A century of exploration had established that a great land mass, North and South America, lay between Europe and the Indies.</s>
<s snum=33>One by one, the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded.</s>
<s snum=34>In fact, Hudson's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap, far to the north.</s>
<s snum=36>Nearly twenty-five years before, Captain John Davis had noted, as he sailed near the Arctic Circle, ``a very great gulf, the water whirling and roaring, as it were the meeting of tides''.</s>
<s snum=37>He named this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the ``Furious Overfall''.</s>
<s snum=38>(Later, it was to be called Hudson Strait.)</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=39>In 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back.</s>
<s snum=40>Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=41>Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was, must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames.</s>
<s snum=42>Ahead were perilous, ice-filled waters.</s>
<s snum=43>On previous voyages, it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain.</s>
<s snum=44>On the second voyage, he had turned back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will- which was obviously not the case.</s>
<s snum=45>On the third voyage, a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in mid-Atlantic.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=46>Worse, his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before.</s>
<s snum=47>Of only one could he be sure- young John Hudson, his second son.</s>
<s snum=48>The mate, Robert Juet, who had kept the journal on the half Moon, was experienced- but he was a bitter old man, ready to complain or desert at any opportunity.</s>
<s snum=49>Philip Staffe, the ship's carpenter, was a good worker, but perversely independent.</s>
<s snum=50>Arnold Lodley and Michael Perse were like the rest- lukewarm, ready to swing against Hudson in a crisis.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=51>But men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find.</s>
<s snum=52>Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer.</s>
<s snum=53>And he refused to be anything else.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=54>It is believed that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was trained on company ships.</s>
<s snum=55>He was a Londoner, married, with three sons.</s>
<s snum=56>(The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage.)</s>
<s snum=57> In 1610, Hudson was probably in his early forties, a good navigator, a stubborn voyager, but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=58>Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the Thames.</s>
<s snum=59>There at the river's edge waited one Henry Greene, whom Hudson listed as a ``clerk''.</s>
<s snum=60>Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent, who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred- pimps, panders and whores.</s>
<s snum=61>He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend, where the Discovery picked him up.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=62>For the first three weeks, the ship skirted up the east coast of Great Britain, then turned westward.</s>
<s snum=63>On May 11, she reached Iceland.</s>
<s snum=64>Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called ``Lousie Bay''.</s>
<s snum=65>The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome.</s>
<s snum=66>With Hudson looking on, his protege Greene picked a fight with the ship's surgeon, Edward Wilson.</s>
<s snum=67>The issue was settled on shore, Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore, determined to catch the next fishing boat back to England.</s>
<s snum=68>With difficulty, Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship, and they sailed from Iceland.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=69>Early in June, the Discovery passed ``Desolation'' (southern Greenland) and in mid-June entered the ``Furious Overfall''.</s>
<s snum=70>Floating ice bore down from the north and west.</s>
<s snum=71>Fog hung over the route constantly.</s>
<s snum=72>Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet.</s>
<s snum=73>The ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic North Pole.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=74>As the bergs grew larger, Hudson was forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay, an inlet of the great strait.</s>
<s snum=75>After finding that its coasts led nowhere, however, he turned north again, toward the main, ice-filled passageway- and the crew, at first uneasy, then frightened, rebelled.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>The trouble was at least partly Juet's doing.</s>
<s snum=77>For weeks he had been saying that Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd.</s>
<s snum=78>The great, crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason.</s>
<s snum=79>A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=80>Instead of quelling the dissension, as many captains of the era would have done (Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's head off under similar circumstances), Hudson decided to be reasonable.</s>
<s snum=81>He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart, which he set up in view of the crew.</s>
<s snum=82>Patiently, he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=83>When Hudson had finished, the ``town meeting'' broke down into a general, wordy argument.</s>
<s snum=84>One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds, he would give ninety of them to be back in England.</s>
<s snum=85>Up spoke carpenter Staffe, who said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home.</s>
<s snum=86>The statement was effective.</s>
<s snum=87>The meeting broke up.</s>
<s snum=88>Hudson was free to sail on.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=89>All through July the Discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long strait, avoiding ice and rocky islands.</s>
<s snum=90>On August 3, two massive headlands reared out of the mists- great gateways never before, so far as Hudson knew, seen by Europeans.</s>
<s snum=91>To starboard was a cape a thousand feet high, patched with ice and snow, populated by thousands of screaming sea birds.</s>
<s snum=92>To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2,000 feet.</s>
<s snum=93>Hudson named the capes Digges and Wolstenholme, for two of his backers.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=94>Hudson pointed the Discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea (now called Hudson Bay), confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the Pacific.</s>
<s snum=95>After three weeks' swift sailing, however, the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas.</s>
<s snum=96>The ship halted.</s>
<s snum=97>The great ``sea to the westwards'' was a dead end.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=98>This must have been Hudson's blackest discovery.</s>
<s snum=99>For he seemed to sense at once that before him was no South Sea, but the solid bulk of the North American continent.</s>
<s snum=100>This was the bitter end, and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=101>Feverishly, he tried to brush away this intuition.</s>
<s snum=102>North and south, east and west, back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay, plowing furiously forward until land appeared, then turning to repeat the process, day after day, week after week.</s>
<s snum=103>Hundreds of miles to the north, the route back to England through the ``Furious Overfall'' was again filling with ice.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=104>The men were at first puzzled, then angered by the aimless tacking.</s>
<s snum=105>Once more, Juet's complaints were the loudest.</s>
<s snum=106>Hudson's reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty.</s>
<s snum=107>Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=108>The trial was held September 10.</s>
<s snum=109>Hudson, presiding, heard Juet's defense, then called for testimony from crew members.</s>
<s snum=110>Juet had made plentiful enemies, several men stepped forward.</s>
<s snum=111>Hands on Bible, seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins.</s>
<s snum=112>Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship.</s>
<s snum=113>Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=114>Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay.</s>
<s snum=115>The new mate was Robert Bylot, talented but inexperienced.</s>
<s snum=116>There were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves.</s>
<s snum=117>The important result, however, was that Juet and Francis Clemens, the deposed boatswain, became Hudson's sworn enemies.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=118>As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay, every incident lessened the crew's respect for him.</s>
<s snum=119>Once, after the Discovery lay for a week in rough weather, Hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed.</s>
<s snum=120>Just as it was being hauled inboard, a sea hit the ship.</s>
<s snum=121>Michael Butt and Adame Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured.</s>
<s snum=122>The anchor cable would have been lost overboard, but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe.</s>
