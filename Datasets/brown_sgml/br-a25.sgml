<hl>ASILOMAR, MARCH 26</hl>
<p>
<s snum=1>Vast spraying programs conducted by ``technicians with narrow training and little wisdom'' are endangering crops and wildlife, Carl W. Buchheister, president of the National Audubon Society, said today.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=2>``It is like handing a loaded .45 automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play'', he commented.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=3>Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target, the fire ant.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=4>``But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop'', he said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=5>The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming.</s>
<s snum=6>There have even been serious errors in the U. S. Forest Service, whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training, he added.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>``The news of their experiments reach the farmers who, forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents, are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries'', Buchheister told the delegates.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=8>In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying, Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill, creation of national seashore parks, including Point Reyes; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed; a pesticides co-ordination act; stronger water pollution control programs, and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=9>The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon Society.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=10>Mrs. Norman Livermore, president of the Marin Conservation League, handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W. Buchheister, president of the Society.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=11>The presentation was made before several hundred persons at the annual meeting of the League at Olney Hall, College of Marin, Kentfield.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>Buchheister pledged the land would be an ``inviolate'' sanctuary for all birds, animals and plants.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=13>Seventeen years ago today, German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a ~V-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=14>The World War /2, German bomber rolled down a runway and took off.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=15>The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip.</s>
<s snum=16>This had never been done before.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=17>Now a quiet-spoken, middle-aged man, Fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and Space Division at Sunnyvale, where he played a key role in the development of the Navy's Polaris missile.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=18>He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>``The first two pilots had crashed'', he said.</s>
<s snum=20>``I had developed the machines and therefore knew them.</s>
<s snum=21>It was time to go up myself''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=22>Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler's super-secret ``Reichenberg project'', which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=23>About 200 of the special ~V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead.</s>
<s snum=24>The target was Allied shipping- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=25>The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's flight.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism, the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=27>At 12,000 feet, Fiedler signaled ``release'', and started the roaring pulse-jet engine- then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=28>To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck, hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h..</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=29>It was probably man's first successful flight in a missile.</s>
<s snum=30>``She flew beautifully'', said Fiedler.</s>
<s snum=31>``There was only one power control- a valve to adjust the fuel flow.</s>
<s snum=32>I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=33>Using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons, Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=34>He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h.- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown- and banked into the airfield.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>Moments later the ~V-1 skimmed across the landing strip, edging closer and closer to a touchdown- then in a streamer of dust it landed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=36>Fiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=37>The missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb.</s>
<s snum=38>Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water, striking below the waterline of individual ships.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=39>A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers, but the project was halted before the end of the war, and the missiles later fell into Allied hands.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=40>Now a family man with three children, Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale.</s>
<s snum=41>His spare time is spent in soaring gliders.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=42>``It's so quiet'', he said, ``so slow, serene- and so challenging''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=43>John Di Massimo has been elected president of the 1961 Columbus Day Celebration Committee, it was announced yesterday.</s>

</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>Members of the San Francisco American Friends Service, a Quaker organization, will march to San Francisco for a rally in Union Square at 2 p. m. Saturday.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=50>In a letter to the American Friends Service, Dr.Schweitzer wrote:</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=51>``Leading Nations of the West and of the East keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>``They cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack.</s>
<s snum=53>The only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons; otherwise no peace is possible.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=54>``Governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger; therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=55>A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of Ben Stein, 47, who collected big fees as a ``labor consultant'' and operator of a janitors' service.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=56>Before he testified for 20 minutes, Stein, who lives at 3300 Lake Shore dr., admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums.</s>
</p>
<hl>GLIMCO A BUDDY</hl>
<p>
<s snum=57>Among his gangland buddies, he said, were Joseph [Joey]Glimco, a mob labor racketeer, and four gang gambling chiefs, Gus [Slim] Alex, Ralph Pierce, Joe [Caesar]DiVarco, and Jimmy [Monk] Allegretti.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=58>Another hoodlum, Louis Arger, drew $39,000 from Stein's janitor firm, the National Maintenance company, in three years ending in 1959, Stein disclosed in an interview.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=59>``I put Arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier'', Stein said.</s>
<s snum=60>``But Arger never was able to produce it, so I cut him off my payroll''.</s>
</p>
<hl>CONNECTION IS SOUGHT</hl>
<p>
<s snum=61>Other witnesses, after appearances before the jury, which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations, disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of gangsters, including Glimco and Alex.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=62>The federal lawyers, according to their witnesses, also were tracing Stein's fees as a labor consultant.</s>
<s snum=63>Under scrutiny, two of the witnesses said, were payments and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison st..</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>The company supplies janitors and workmen for McCormick Place and factories, liquor firms, and other businesses.</s>
</p>
<hl>LEE A WITNESS</hl>
<p>
<s snum=65>Among the witnesses were Ed J. Lee, director of McCormick Place; Jerome Leavitt, a partner in the Union Liquor company, 3247 S. Kedzie av., Dominic Senese, a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony Accardo, onetime gang chief; and Frank W. Pesce, operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm, the Best Sanitation and Supply company, 1215 Blue Island av..</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=66>Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors in McCormick Place.</s>
<s snum=67>Stein's fee, Lee said, was 10 per cent of the janitors' pay.</s>
<s snum=68>Stein estimated this amount at ``about $1,500 or $1,600 a month''.</s>
</p>
<hl>A $12,500 PAYMENT</hl>
<p>
<s snum=69>Leavitt, as he entered the jury room, said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12,500 his liquor firm paid to Stein for ``labor consultant work'' with five unions which organized Leavitt's workers.</s>
<s snum=70>Leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman's local, the teamsters union, a salesman's union, the janitors' union, and a bottling workers' union.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>Government attorneys, Leavitt said, have questioned him closely about ``five or six loans'' totaling about $40,000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the last year.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=72>All of the loans, in amounts up to $5,000 each, have been repaid by Stein, according to Leavitt.</s>
<s snum=73>Stein said he needed the money, Leavitt said, to ``meet the payroll'' at National Maintenance company.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=74>The deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco's discredited taxi drivers' union at 1213-15 Blue Island av..</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over Chicago yesterday.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>The reading, which has been watched with interest since Russia's detonation of a super bomb Monday, was 4 on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday, a level far below the danger point, according to the board of health.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=77>The weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week.</s>
<s snum=78>A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=79>Curtis Allen Huff, 41, of 1630 Lake av., Wilmette, was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association, 1 S. Dearborn st., where he formerly was employed as an attorney.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=80>Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20,000, altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10,000.</s>
</p>
<hl>LIEN PAYMENTS INVOLVED</hl>
<p>
<s snum=81>Huff's attorney, Antone F. Gregorio, quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff, as attorney for the loan association, in satisfaction of mechanic's liens on property on which the association held mortgages.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay ``the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=83>Huff, who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September of this year, said that his private practice was not lucrative.</s>
<s snum=84>Huff lives with his wife, Sue, and their four children, 6 to 10 years old, in a $25,000 home with a $17,000 mortgage.</s>
</p>
<hl>CHARGE LISTS 3 CHECKS</hl>
<p>
<s snum=85>The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by Leo Blaber, an attorney for the association.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=86>The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept. 18.</s>
<s snum=87>On that date, according to Gregorio, Huff left his home and took a room in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence av..</s>
<s snum=88>There, Gregorio said, Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=89>Later, Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the Sherman House, using a credit card.</s>
<s snum=90>All bounced.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=91>When Huff attempted to cash another $100 check there Monday, hotel officials called police.</s>
</p>
<hl>BONN, OCT. 24 (~UPI)</hl>
<p>
<s snum=92>Greece and West Germany have ratified an agreement under which Germany will pay $28,700,000 to Greek victims of Nazi persecution, it was announced today.</s>
