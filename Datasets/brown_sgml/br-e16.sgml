<s snum=1>Hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch a family boat.</s>
<s snum=2>Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view.</s>
<s snum=3>Youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom, bunks for three, galley and marine toilet.</s>
<s snum=4>The gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit.</s>
<s snum=5>All are well distributed, not crowded together near the stern.</s>
<s snum=6>And with passenger weight shifted forward, Hotei levels off for speed under power of a Merc 800.</s>
<s snum=7>The 80-~hp motor drives her at 25 ~mph with six aboard!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=8>With only two aboard, Hotei does better than 27~mph- and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop.</s>
<s snum=9>She also banks into a turn like a fine runabout- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser.</s>
<s snum=10>Nor is she a wet boat.</s>
<s snum=11>We've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>A lot of thought went into storage space construction.</s>
<s snum=13>There's a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items.</s>
<s snum=14>The cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis, life jackets, etc..</s>
<s snum=15>The aft cockpit has a **f storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat.</s>
<s snum=16>On each side of the motor well there's storage for battery, bumpers, line and spare props with six-gallon gas tanks below.</s>
<s snum=17>The well itself is designed to take two Merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=18>Needless to say, you can't build Hotei in a couple of weeks.</s>
<s snum=19>Our building time was slightly over 400 hours- but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom, sink, head and hardware was under $800.</s>
<s snum=20>A comparable manufactured boat would cost close to $3,000.</s>
<s snum=21>Consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3,000and your building time is well worth it.</s>
<s snum=22>A Gator trailer, Model 565, is used to transport the boat to the waterways.</s>
<s snum=23>This piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=24>All framing in Hotei is one-inch mahogany which, in the dressed state you buy it, is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings.</s>
<s snum=25>Therefore, the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens, etc., on a table saw.</s>
<s snum=26>Besides flathead bronze screws, silicon bronze Stronghold nails (made by Independent Nail + Packing Co., Bridgewater, Mass.) are used extensively in assembly and Weldwood resorcinal glue is used in all the joints.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=27>Construction follows a thorough study of the drawings.</s>
<s snum=28>Start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor.</s>
<s snum=29>Draw each outline in a different-color chalk, one on top of the other.</s>
<s snum=30>In this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=31>The transom frame is made first with the joints lapped, glued and fastened with one-inch, No. 12 Stronghold nails.</s>
<s snum=32>After notching it for the keelson, chines and battens, the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue and the same type nails.</s>
<s snum=33>All frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint, again using the one-inch, No. 12 nails.</s>
<s snum=34>The frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines.</s>
<s snum=35>If notched for the battens, they would require more work, be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge water could flow through.</s>
<s snum=36>Nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=37>The jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete.</s>
<s snum=38>This is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction.</s>
<s snum=39>Be sure all members are parallel, vertical and level as required.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=40>After the frames and transom are set up on the jig and temporarily braced, a piece of three-inch-wide mahogany (only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness is used throughout) is butted between frames one and two below the line of the keelson.</s>
<s snum=41>The frames are glued and screwed to this piece.</s>
<s snum=42>The joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated Fiberglas cloth and nailed.</s>
<s snum=43>It is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=44>The keelson, made of two three-inch widths, is next installed.</s>
<s snum=45>The first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two.</s>
<s snum=46>The second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first.</s>
<s snum=47>Note, however, that it is six inches shorter at the forward end.</s>
<s snum=48>One-inch, No.10 screws are used in both cases.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>A stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one.</s>
<s snum=50>The stem is laminated from four pieces.</s>
<s snum=51>Take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four.</s>
<s snum=52>Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig.</s>
<s snum=53>The first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames.</s>
<s snum=54>The second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member.</s>
<s snum=55>They're glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson.</s>
<s snum=56>A number of ~C clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=57>All bottom battens are two inches wide.</s>
<s snum=58>The side ones are a half-inch narrower.</s>
<s snum=59>The battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames.</s>
<s snum=60>Glue and 1-1/2-inch, No. 10 screws are used.</s>
<s snum=61>Placement is important because the rear seat, bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens.</s>
<s snum=62>With the exception of two battens, all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling.</s>
<s snum=63>The chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>Fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a Skill planer and a simple jig.</s>
<s snum=65>I clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of Sure Grips.</s>
<s snum=66>The aluminum, flush against the battens, acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily.</s>
<s snum=67>If you don't own a planer and don't want to buy one, it's well worth renting.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>The planking is five-ply, 3/8-inch-thick Weldwood Royal Marine plywood.</s>
<s snum=69>This can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long.</s>
<s snum=70>The 42-inch width leaves very little waste.</s>
<s snum=71>Four pieces are used.</s>
<s snum=72>Plank the sides first, using glue and one-inch, No. 12 Stronghold nails at all battens, the stem and the transom.</s>
<s snum=73>Another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening.</s>
<s snum=74>The best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off.</s>
<s snum=75>Then trim the excess.</s>
<s snum=76>I used a Homemaster Routo-Jig made by Porter Cable for this job.</s>
<s snum=77>It's good for cutting all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade at high ~rpm and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>When cut, the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming.</s>
<s snum=79>Then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom, frames, keelson and all the battens.</s>
<s snum=80>It may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings.</s>
<s snum=81>The next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points.</s>
<s snum=82>Then it is replaced and fastened.</s>
<s snum=83>The bottom planking is applied in the same manner.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>After planking, the bottom gets a layer of Fiberglas.</s>
<s snum=85>The spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws.</s>
<s snum=86>Then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation.</s>
<s snum=87>Since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails, they are also rough-sanded in that area.</s>
<s snum=88>The cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time.</s>
<s snum=89>A 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line by about three inches.</s>
<s snum=90>Lay the cloth in place and trim it to size.</s>
<s snum=91>Then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin.</s>
<s snum=92>When the resin has hardened, mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish.</s>
<s snum=93>I used bright red, mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener.</s>
<s snum=94>Using a cheap brush, coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth.</s>
<s snum=95>When the cloth is smooth, apply another coat of resin, spreading it with a paint roller.</s>
<s snum=96>Be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=97>When the whole bottom has hardened, use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail.</s>
<s snum=98>Then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem.</s>
<s snum=99>Before the resin has hardened, screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline.</s>
<s snum=100>This protects the bottom in beaching.</s>
<s snum=101>Fiberglas materials are available from Glass Plastic Supply Co., 1605 W.Elizabeth ave., Linden, N. J..</s>
<s snum=102>They will also supply literature on application.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=103>The hull is now turned over (with the help of about seven friends) and placed in a level, well-braced position.</s>
<s snum=104>I set it on the Gator trailer.</s>
<s snum=105>I laid three layers of glass cloth on the inside of the stem, also installing a bow eye at this time.</s>
<s snum=106>For added strength, I also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint.</s>
<s snum=107>Again, these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=108>After trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height, the top of the side planking is installed.</s>
<s snum=109>This is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom.</s>
<s snum=110>These flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry.</s>
<s snum=111>When they're on, the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=112>The sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom, forming a real strong transom brace.</s>
<s snum=113>Note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=114>The decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood.</s>
<s snum=115>All the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood.</s>
<s snum=116>Most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring.</s>
<s snum=117>The exception is where the flooring butts.</s>
<s snum=118>These battens are glued and screwed to the frames.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=119>With all deck battens in place, the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line.</s>
<s snum=120>Use one coat of Firzite and one coat of marine paint.</s>
<s snum=121>Bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=122>After the decking is on, the cabin sides are installed.</s>
<s snum=123>They're followed by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated.</s>
<s snum=124>The windshield glass is shatterproof and Plexiglas is used in the cabin.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=125>Inside, bunks are framed up and installed as indicated.</s>
<s snum=126>A head is a handy thing to have and I installed one under a removable section of the port bunk.</s>
<s snum=127>The sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink.</s>
<s snum=128>For padding the seats and bunks, I used Ensolite, Type ~M.</s>
<s snum=129>Lightweight, non-absorbent, fire resistant and dimensionally stable, it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement.</s>
<s snum=130>Available in **f sheets, it costs about a dollar a square foot.</s>
