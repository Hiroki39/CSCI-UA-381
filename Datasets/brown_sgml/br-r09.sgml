<s snum=1>Dear Sirs: Let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception in your minds, wherever you are.</s>
<s snum=2>The collective by which I address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves.</s>
<s snum=3>It is, I am reliably given to understand, the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost; i.e., burglars who rob while the tenants are absent, in contrast to hot-slough prowlers, those who work while the occupants are home.</s>
<s snum=4>Since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess, you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior.</s>
<s snum=5>Far from it; I merely draw an etymological distinction, hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman.</s>
<s snum=6>Above all, disabuse yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence, to whimper over the loss of a few objets d'art, or to shame you into rectitude.</s>
<s snum=7>My object, rather, is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you, far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict.</s>
<s snum=8>You have unwittingly set in motion forces so malign, so vindictive, that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them.</s>
<s snum=9>Quite candidly, fellows, I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the rice in China.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=10>As you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations, permit me to recapitulate them briefly.</s>
<s snum=11>Sometime on Saturday evening, August 22nd, while my family and I were dining at the Hostaria dell' Orso, in Rome, you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and let yourselves into the premises.</s>
<s snum=12>Hastening to the attic, the temperature of which was easily hotter than the Gold Coast, you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet, some khaki pants, and the like, and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there.</s>
<s snum=13>What you were looking for (unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis rackets and fly screens)eludes me, but to judge from phonograph records scattered about a fumed-oak Victrola, you danced two tangos and a paso doble, which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu.</s>
<s snum=14>You then descended one story, glommed a television set from the music room- the only constructive feature of your visit, by the way- and, returning to the ground floor, entered the master bedroom.</s>
<s snum=15>From the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath, you abstracted seventeen ivory, metal, wood, and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin, two snuffboxes, and a jade-handled magnifying glass.</s>
<s snum=16>Rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby, you unearthed an antique French chess set in ivory and sandalwood, which, along with two box Kodaks, you added to your haul.</s>
<s snum=17>Then, having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on, you lammed out the front door, considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=18>So much for the tiresome facts, as familiar to you, I'm sure, as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake.</s>
<s snum=19>The foregoing, aided by several clues I'll withhold to keep you on your toes, will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of Inspector Javert, but before they close in, gird yourselves, I repeat, for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless.</s>
<s snum=20>Fourteen of the sculptures you took posses properties of a most curious and terrifying nature, as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in patches.</s>
<s snum=21>In time, these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce, riddling you with frambesia, the king's evil, sheep rot, and clonic spasm, until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release.</s>
<s snum=22>All this, though, is simply a prelude, a curtain-raiser, for what ensues, and I doubt whether any Occidental could accurately forecast it.</s>
<s snum=23>If, however, it would help to intensify your anguish, I can delimit the powers of a few of the divinities you've affronted and describe the punishment they meted out in one analogous instance.</s>
<s snum=24>Hold on tight.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=25>First of all, the six figures of the Buddha you heisted- four Siamese heads, a black obsidian statuette in the earth-touching position, and a large brass figure of the Dying Buddha on a teakwood base.</s>
<s snum=26>Now, you probably share the widespread Western belief that the Lord Buddha is the most compassionate of the gods, much more so than Jehovah and Allah and the rest.</s>
<s snum=27>'Fess up- don't you?</s>
<s snum=28>Well, ordinarily he is, except (as the Wheel of the Law specifies) toward impious folk who steal, disturb, or maltreat the Presence.</s>
<s snum=29>Very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers.</s>
<s snum=30>Eight or ten years ago, a couple of French hoods stole a priceless Khmer head from the Musee Guimet, in Paris, and a week later crawled into the Salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy.</s>
<s snum=31>Hell's own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate their torment; they expired amid indescribable fantods, imploring the Blessed One to forgive their desecration.</s>
<s snum=32>Any reputable French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances, and I'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience, but, for the moment, let's resume our catalogue.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=33>Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead, as a dealer in Khartoum assured me, I am not competent to say.</s>
<s snum=34>Likewise the ivory Chinese female figure known as a ``doctor lady'' (provenance Honan); a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer, but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack.</s>
<s snum=35>The three Indian brass deities, though- Ganessa, Siva, and Krishna- are an altogether different cup of tea.</s>
<s snum=36>They hail from Travancore, a state in the subcontinent where Kali, the goddess of death, is worshiped.</s>
<s snum=37>Have you ever heard of thuggee?</s>
<s snum=38>Nuf sed.</s>
<s snum=39>But it is the wooden sculpture from Bali, the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by a fish, that I particularly call to your attention.</s>
<s snum=40>Oddly enough, this is an amulet against housebreakers, presented to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949.</s>
<s snum=41>Inscribed around its base is a charm in Balinese, a dialect I take it you don't comprehend.</s>
<s snum=42>Neither do I, but the Tjokorda Agoeng was good enough to translate, and I'll do as much for you.</s>
<s snum=43>Whosoever violates our rooftree, the legend states, can expect maximal sorrow.</s>
<s snum=44>The teeth will rain from his mouth like pebbles, his wife will make him cocu with fishmongers, and a trolley car will grow in his stomach.</s>
<s snum=45>Furthermore- and this, to me, strikes an especially warming note- it shall avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot.</s>
<s snum=46>The cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours, and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation.</s>
<s snum=47>Sort of remorseless, isn't it?</s>
<s snum=48>Still, there it is.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>Now, you no doubt regard the preceding as pap; you're tooling around full of gage in your hot rods, gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns and generally behaving like U^bermenschen.</s>
<s snum=50>In that case, listen to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled with our joss.</s>
<s snum=51>A couple of years back, I occupied a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a ``coffin turn''.</s>
<s snum=52>In it was a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked up in Bombay, and occasionally, to make merit, my wife and I garlanded it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap.</s>
<s snum=53>After a while, we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it.</s>
<s snum=54>Our suspicions eventually centered, by the process of elimination, on a grocer's boy, a thoroughly bad hat, who delivered cartons to the people overhead.</s>
<s snum=55>The more I probed into this young man's activities and character, the less savory I found him.</s>
<s snum=56>I learned, for example, that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and, in winter, of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet.</s>
<s snum=57>His energy was prodigious; sometimes he would be up before dawn, clad as a garbage collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us, and thereafter would hurry to the Bronx Zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar butts against their paws.</s>
<s snum=58>Evenings, he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like Enrico + Paglieri's or Peter's Backyard drunkenly donning ladies' hats and singing ``O Sole Mio''.</s>
<s snum=59>In short, and to borrow an arboreal phrase, slash timber.</s>
<s snum=60>Well, the odious little toad went along chivying animals and humans who couldn't retaliate, and in due course, as was inevitable, overreached himself.</s>
<s snum=61>One morning, we discovered not only that the pennies were missing from the idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed out in its lap.</s>
<s snum=62>``Now he's bought it'', said my wife contentedly.</s>
<s snum=63>``No divinity will hold still for that.</s>
<s snum=64>He's really asking for it''.</s>
<s snum=65>And how right she was.</s>
<s snum=66>The next time we saw him, he was a changed person; he had aged thirty years, and his face, the color of tallow, was crisscrossed with wrinkles, as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire.</s>
<s snum=67>Some sort of nemesis was haunting his footsteps, he told us in a quavering voice- either an ape specter or Abe Spector, a process-server, we couldn't determine which.</s>
<s snum=68>His eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as Dr. Grimesby Roylott's when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band.</s>
<s snum=69>The grocery the youth worked for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers, most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi, and let him go.</s>
<s snum=70>The beautiful, the satisfying part of his disintegration, however, was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off.</s>
<s snum=71>Reduced to beggary, he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer.</s>
<s snum=72>His hubris, deficiency of taste, and sadism carried him straightaway to the top.</s>
<s snum=73>He evolved programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks, and quickly superseded his boss.</s>
<s snum=74>Not long ago, I rode down with him in an elevator in Radio City; he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at once, clearly a man in extremis.</s>
<s snum=75>``See that guy''? the operator asked pityingly.</s>
<s snum=76>``I wouldn't be in his shoes for all the rice in China.</s>
<s snum=77>There's some kind of a nemesis haunting his footsteps''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>However one looks at it, therefore, I'd say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy.</s>
<s snum=79>The inventory you acquired from me isn't going to be easy to move; you can't very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot Bodhisattva.</s>
<s snum=80>Additionally, since you're going to be hors de combat pretty soon with sprue, yaws, Delhi boil, the Granville wilt, liver fluke, bilharziasis, and a host of other complications of the hex you've aroused, you mustn't expect to be lionized socially.</s>
<s snum=81>My advice, if you live long enough to continue your vocation, is that the next time you're attracted by the exotic, pass it up- it's nothing but a headache.</s>
<s snum=82>As you can count on me to do the same.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=83>compassionately yours, </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>S. J. Perelman.</s>
</p>
<hl>REVULSION IN THE DESERT</hl>
<p>
<s snum=85>The doors of the ~D train slid shut, and as I dropped into a seat and, exhaling, looked up across the aisle, the whole aviary in my head burst into song.</s>
<s snum=86>She was a living doll and no mistake- the blue-black bang, the wide cheekbones, olive-flushed, that betrayed the Cherokee strain in her Midwestern lineage, and the mouth whose only fault, in the novelist's carping phrase, was that the lower lip was a trifle too voluptuous.</s>
<s snum=87>From what I was able to gauge in a swift, greedy glance, the figure inside the coral-colored boucle dress was stupefying.</s>
