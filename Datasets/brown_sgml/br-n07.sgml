<s snum=1>The flat, hard cap was small, but he thrust it to the back of his head.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=2>``Tie him up''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=3>``Hell with it''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=4>Before they could guess his intention Rankin stepped forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered head, hard.</s>
<s snum=5>The man went over without sound, falling to the bare floor.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=6>Barton said harshly, ``Why did you do that''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>Rankin sneered at him.</s>
<s snum=8>``What did you want me to do, kiss him?</s>
<s snum=9>He dumped me in solitary twice''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=10>Barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him around.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=11>``Let's get one thing straight, you and me.</s>
<s snum=12>The only reason we brought you was to get Miller out.</s>
<s snum=13>If you ever try anything without my orders I'll kill you''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=14>Fred Rankin looked at him.</s>
<s snum=15>It seemed to Barton that the green eyes mocked him, the thin-lipped smile held insolence, but he had no time to waste now.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=16>``Come on.</s>
<s snum=17>Let's move''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=18>They filed out through the guard-room door, into the paved square.</s>
<s snum=19>There were three other men within this prison whom Barton would have liked to liberate, but they were in other cell blocks.</s>
<s snum=20>There was no chance.</s>
<s snum=21>They moved slowly, toward the main gate, following the wall.</s>
<s snum=22>There was no moon.</s>
<s snum=23>They had chosen this night purposely.</s>
<s snum=24>They reached the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above, and Powers slipped through the door.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=25>Two men were on duty inside, playing pinochle, relaxed.</s>
<s snum=26>They looked up in surprise as Powers came in.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=27>``What are you doing out of the block''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=28>``It's Curtiss'', he said, naming the man Rankin had hit.</s>
<s snum=29>``I've got to have help''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>They stared at him.</s>
<s snum=31>The sergeant in charge climbed to his feet.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=32>``What's wrong with him''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=33>``He's having some kind of a fit''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=34>The sergeant turned to the door.</s>
<s snum=35>As he passed through it Barton shoved his gun against the man's side.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=36>``One sound and you're dead''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=37>The sergeant froze.</s>
<s snum=38>Powers had not followed.</s>
<s snum=39>Powers was covering the remaining guard.</s>
<s snum=40>The man half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell.</s>
<s snum=41>Powers knocked his arm aside.</s>
<s snum=42>Deliberately, with none of Rankin's viciousness, he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard's head.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=43>They were free.</s>
<s snum=44>Even Barton could not quite believe it.</s>
<s snum=45>It had gone without a hitch.</s>
<s snum=46>They slid through the wicket in the big gate, ghosted across the dark ground.</s>
<s snum=47>Five minutes later they reached the horses.</s>
<s snum=48>Barton was relieved to see that Carl Dill and Emmett Foster had brought extra mounts.</s>
<s snum=49>He had been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the escape party they would be short.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=50>No one hurried.</s>
<s snum=51>They walked the horses, heading along the river, Barton and Emmett Foster in the lead, seven men riding quietly through the night.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>The only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards, three the striped suits of convicts.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>Five miles.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=54>In a small grove against the river they halted, turning deep into the protection of the trees.</s>
<s snum=55>Foster had brought extra clothing also.</s>
<s snum=56>A good man, Emmett.</s>
<s snum=57>He had been one of the original Night Riders, one who had escaped the trial.</s>
<s snum=58>It was to him that Barton had sent Carl Dill on Dill's release from the prison.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=59>Clyde Miller was crying softly to himself, shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants, the worn brown shirt.</s>
<s snum=60>Kid Boyd was unusually silent, Rankin watchful, a few paces apart.</s>
<s snum=61>Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to Powers.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=62>``I won't even try to thank you''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=63>The ex-prison guard was embarrassed.</s>
<s snum=64>He said in a studied voice, ``I didn't do it for you.</s>
<s snum=65>I did it for the valley.</s>
<s snum=66>You're the only man the Night Riders will follow.</s>
<s snum=67>We've been starving and I don't like to starve''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>Barton turned away, his eyes falling upon Rankin beside his horse.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=69>``Good luck''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=70>The murderer lifted his head.</s>
<s snum=71>``Meaning you want me to ride out''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=72>``You aren't one of us.</s>
<s snum=73>There's nothing for you here''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=74>``I got no place to go''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>Barton hesitated.</s>
<s snum=76>He did not trust Rankin, his violent temper, his killer instinct.</s>
<s snum=77>But ten years in prison had taught him realities.</s>
<s snum=78>They were in a fight, outweighed in both numbers and money.</s>
<s snum=79>It was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses, to call them Night Riders, to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure.</s>
<s snum=80>But if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals, men who knew how to use a gun against men, who would match the killers on the other side.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=81>``Your choice'', he said briefly, and turned to Kid Boyd.</s>
<s snum=82>``Bury those uniforms so they won't be found''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=83>Then Barton touched Carl Dill's arm and moved off, up the river bank.</s>
<s snum=84>He wanted a careful, uninterrupted report from Dill on the conditions in the valley.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=85>They squatted on their heels in the deep mud and Dill found a cigar in his breast pocket, passing it over silently.</s>
<s snum=86>He too knew the agony of going for weeks, sometimes months without the solace of tobacco.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=87>Mitchell Barton drew in the fragrance deeply, letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhaled.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=88>Through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly.</s>
<s snum=89>For his first five years in prison, they had shared a cell.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=90>Carl Dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man.</s>
<s snum=91>He had been the auditor for the mining syndicate, and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate's money.</s>
<s snum=92>He had done time for the theft.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=93>The one thing they had in common was their hatred.</s>
<s snum=94>Both hated Donald Kruger.</s>
<s snum=95>It had drawn them together, and since his release from prison Dill had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=96>He said now, ``I've got the perfect headquarters set up.</s>
<s snum=97>The old Haskell mine''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=98>Mitch Barton knew the place.</s>
<s snum=99>Twenty years before a group of Easterners had bought out the Haskell claims in the rocky hills south of Grass Valley.</s>
<s snum=100>They had spent a million dollars, carving in a road, putting up buildings, drilling their haulage tunnel.</s>
<s snum=101>Then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=102>``The road's washed badly'', said Dill, ``but there's a trail you can get over with a horse.</s>
<s snum=103>A company of cavalry couldn't come in there if two men were guarding that trail''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=104>Barton nodded.</s>
<s snum=105>``How do the valley people feel''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=106>``As mad as ever.</s>
<s snum=107>But Kruger's men keep them off balance, and they don't trust me.</s>
<s snum=108>I'm an outsider.</s>
<s snum=109>When they learn you're in the hills though, they'll rally, don't worry about that''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=110>Barton waited for a long moment, then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=111>``My boy.</s>
<s snum=112>Did you find him''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=113>Dill was silent as if he hated to answer, and Barton had a cold, sick feeling of apprehension.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=114>``He's in Morgan's Ferry''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=115>Barton half-straightened in surprise.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=116>``What's he doing there''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>Again Dill hesitated.</s>
<s snum=118>``Dealing faro''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=119>``Dealing faro?</s>
<s snum=120>How come''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=121>``Your sister-in-law has the faro bank in Cap Ayres' saloon''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=122>Barton cursed under his breath.</s>
<s snum=123>After another long pause he asked, ``How many people know who they are''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=124>``Everyone.</s>
<s snum=125>Your cousin Finley saw to that.</s>
<s snum=126>He's quite a rat, you know.</s>
<s snum=127>He sold out to Kruger's men.</s>
<s snum=128>He's informed them of everything you've ever written him.</s>
<s snum=129>He wants your ranch''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=130>Barton stood up.</s>
<s snum=131>He said tensely, ``All right.</s>
<s snum=132>Let's go get the boy''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=133>Dill had come up also.</s>
<s snum=134>``I was afraid of this.</s>
<s snum=135>I almost didn't tell you''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=136>``If you hadn't I'd have killed you''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=137>Dill's voice tightened.</s>
<s snum=138>``But you can't ride into the Ferry.</s>
<s snum=139>That's what they'll expect you to do.</s>
<s snum=140>They'll be there waiting for you.</s>
<s snum=141>I understand how you feel about the child''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=142>``The hell you do''.</s>
<s snum=143>Barton's voice was rougher than Dill had ever heard it.</s>
<s snum=144>``I never saw him.</s>
<s snum=145>My wife died in childbirth after I was sent away.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=146>``I can't leave him there.</s>
<s snum=147>Donald Kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage, and I wouldn't entrust a snake to his tender care.</s>
<s snum=148>I've got to get the boy.</s>
<s snum=149>Let's ride''.</s>
</p>
<hl>CHAPTER TWO</hl>
<p>
<s snum=150>Barton's men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places, carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult.</s>
<s snum=151>It was over an hour before their escape was discovered, but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=152>It reached Donald Kruger in his massive home in Burlingame.</s>
<s snum=153>It reached the mines at North San Juan and Bloomfield.</s>
<s snum=154>It brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=155>For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg, and Mitchell Barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=156>Creighton Hague sat in his office above the Ione pit.</s>
<s snum=157>The office was of logs, four rooms, each heated by an iron stove.</s>
<s snum=158>The building was dwarfed by the scene outside.</s>
<s snum=159>There a dozen giant monitors played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=160>The gravel was the bed of an ancient river, buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth.</s>
<s snum=161>It was partially cemented by ages and pressure, yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams, the force of a thousand fire hoses, and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices.</s>
<s snum=162>A million dollars' of gold a month.</s>
<s snum=163>A million tons of rock and soil and brush.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=164>The monitors ran twenty-four hours each day.</s>
<s snum=165>Their roar, like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles.</s>
<s snum=166>Hague, like all who worked near the pits, was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=167>He was a big man, wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air.</s>
<s snum=168>Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt.</s>
<s snum=169>Ten years older than Mitch Barton, he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=170>He was proud of his accomplishments, proud of his job, proud that Donald Kruger and his associates trusted him.</s>
<s snum=171>He lived and breathed for the mining company.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=172>No man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless, and Hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=173>There came a ghost of noise at the office door and Hague swung to see Kodyke in the entrance from the outer room.</s>
<s snum=174>Hague had never accustomed himself to Kodyke.</s>
<s snum=175>The man was tall, thin, with a narrow face and a too-large nose.</s>
<s snum=176>The eyes always held Hague, eyes of a dead man, lidless as a lizard's, with the fixed intensity of a cobra.</s>
<s snum=177>Even Hague was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was Kodyke.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=178>He knew nothing about the man's history.</s>
<s snum=179>Kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from Kruger.</s>
<s snum=180>Kodyke was to head the dread company police.</s>
<s snum=181>He ran the change rooms.</s>
<s snum=182>He threw out the hi-graders.</s>
<s snum=183>He supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to San Francisco.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=184>Hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike.</s>
<s snum=185>He pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=186>``This is Mitchell Barton.</s>
<s snum=187>He broke out of Folsom last night.</s>
<s snum=188>Apparently he bribed one of the guards.</s>
<s snum=189>We want him back there or we want him dead''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=190>Kodyke took the picture in a lean hand, studying it thoughtfully.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=191>``Dangerous''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=192>``Dangerous, yes.</s>
<s snum=193>You know how the ranchers in the valley are.</s>
<s snum=194>They blame us for all their troubles.</s>
<s snum=195>Ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches.</s>
<s snum=196>It cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them.</s>
<s snum=197>We don't want Barton's Night Riders loose again''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=198>The gunman nodded, slipping the picture into his breast pocket, saying nothing.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=199>Normally Hague wasted no words, but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew Kodyke was aware of all he said.</s>
