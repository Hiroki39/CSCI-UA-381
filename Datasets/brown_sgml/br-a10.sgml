<s snum=6>Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically, E. M. Martin, assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>Martin, who has been in office in Washington, D.C., for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel.</s>
<s snum=8>He told some 350 persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways, following their own paths.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=9>``We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which, if not identical, is congenial with ours'', he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty.</s>
</p>
<hl>PATIENCE NEEDED</hl>
<p>
<s snum=10>Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice, he said, was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=11>He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in, and added, ``so long as people rebel, we must not give up''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>Martin called for patience on the part of Americans.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=13>``The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build'', he said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=14>By leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare, he said.</s>
</p>
<hl>INDIVIDUAL HELP BEST</hl>
<p>
<s snum=15>``We have no reason to fear failure, but we must be extraordinarily patient'', the assistant secretary said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=16>Economically, Martin said, the United States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves.</s>
<s snum=17>Private business is more effective than government aid, he explained, because individuals are able to work with the people themselves.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=18>The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country, at what he termed a ``social cost''.</s>

</p>
<p>
<s snum=21>But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go, and whose advice it should follow.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=22>The board members, after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar, 1409 ~SW Maplecrest Dr., said they thought they had already been cooperating.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=23>Chairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem, in case of atomic attack, but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=24>Dr. Melvin W. Barnes, superintendent, said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership, perhaps on the national level, to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would ``be more fruitful'', and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=25>``Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster'', he said.</s>
<s snum=26>``Nobody really expects to evacuate.</s>
<s snum=27>I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=28>Mrs. Molvar, who kept reiterating her request that they ``please take a stand'', said, ``We must have faith in somebody- on the local level, and it wouldn't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=29>Dr. Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans, even for a high school where there were lots of cars ``might not be realistic and would not work''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program.</s>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<s snum=58>At the adoption, the Rev. T. F.

</p>
<hl>NEW POINT ADDED</hl>
<p>
<s snum=59>Many changes involved minor editing and clarification; however, the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list.</s>

</p>
<p>
<s snum=74>The Rev. R. L. Brandt, national secretary of the home missions department, stressed the need for the first two years' work.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>``Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church.</s>
<s snum=76>This means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life'', he told delegates Friday.</s>
</p>
<hl>CHURCH LOSES PACE</hl>
<p>
<s snum=77>Talking of the rapid population growth (upwards of 12,000 babies born daily) with an immigrant entering the United States every 1-1/2 minutes, he said ``our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>``In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches'', the Rev. Mr. Brandt said, adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000persons.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=79>``In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois, where we have 200; 800 in Southern New England, we have 60; we need 100 in Rhode Island, we have none'', he said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=80>To step up the denomination's program, the Rev.Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years.</s>

<p>
<s snum=90>In denying motions for dismissal, Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that ``a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=91>Attorney Dwight L. Schwab, in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein, argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy, but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide.</s>
</p>
<hl>PROOF LACK CHARGED</hl>
<p>
<s snum=92>Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the U.S. mails to defraud, to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied:</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=93>``It is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U.S. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy, and the mails were then used to carry it out''.</s>
