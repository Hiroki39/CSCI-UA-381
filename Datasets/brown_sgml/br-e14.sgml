<s snum=1>Do start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals.</s>

</p>
<p>
<s snum=10>Do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them.</s>

<s snum=12>If necessary to replace both halves on grill, sear cuts and allot extra time.</s>
<s snum=13>For roasts, insert meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone.</s>
<s snum=14>Also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=15>Don't practice a new recipe on guests.</s>
<s snum=16>Have a test-run on the family first, to be sure timing and seasoning are right.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=17>Do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it.</s>

<s snum=23>When you start the outdoor performance, you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen.</s>
<s snum=24>(This goes for getting a drink tray ready, and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand long before the party begins.)</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=25>Don't think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the world.</s>
<s snum=26>The simplest grill (pan type)or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef.</s>
<s snum=27>You need tongs to handle meat; long forks for turning potatoes and corn; heavy foil on hand at all times.</s>
<s snum=28>And lots of hot pads!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=29>Do keep the grill high enough above the fire so that when fat from meat drips down and flares up, flames cannot reach the meat.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>Don't forget to have a supply of Melamine plates, bowls, cups, saucers, and platters for outdoor use.</s>

<s snum=36>Oilcloth only costs about 79~c a yard for the very best.</s>
<s snum=37>Tougher than plastic, it wears well.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=38>Don't forget- when you take to the hills or the beach- that your cooler, which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard, is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments.</s>
<s snum=39>There are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes.</s>
<s snum=40>With them, you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures, and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders, to the marina or picnic, in A-1 condition.</s>

<p>
<s snum=41>Do use paper napkins; lots of them.</s>
<s snum=42>Except when you prepare ``do it yourself'' shish kebob or a lobster roast.</s>

<s snum=51>Get copper or earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot.</s>
<s snum=52>Be sure to get a few more than you need.</s>
<s snum=53>You will discover you keep the sauce for basting meat in one, use six for drinks, serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen- and need one more to mix the salad dressing.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=54>Don't forget the joys of a meal on the road.</s>
<s snum=55>If you travel over the vast U.S.A. you will, no doubt, discover that feeding is an expensive business.</s>
<s snum=56>Decide in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment to work.</s>
<s snum=57>You can take it with you- a picnic bag, a grill, a cooler for soft drinks and beer, and for frozen convenience foods.</s>
<s snum=58>Eat in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings; or just evenings.</s>
<s snum=59>Turn off at any one of the marked picnic areas (gasoline companies have touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities)and- with soft drinks cooled from morning loading up, hamburger, buns, an array of relishes, and fresh fruit- your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant, and 100% more fun.</s>
<s snum=60>You need a little stove, a coffee pot and a stew pot; maybe a skillet, a basket of essentials like salt, pepper, plates, forks, knives and a can opener.</s>
<s snum=61>As you pull out of your motel or national park home-for-the-night, visit a market and buy just what you need for the next meal.</s>
<s snum=62>For 25~c load up the cooler with ice and keep cool pop in the car.</s>

<hl>SIMPLE MEAT DISHES</hl>
<p>
<s snum=63>Spice is a fact of life in the U.S.A..</s>
<s snum=64>You only have to think of franks and sausages to know what I mean.</s>
<s snum=65>Go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics- cervelat, salami, Vienna sausages, mettwurst, bratwurst, bockwurst, knackwurst, Bologna, pepperoni, blutwurst- and you have a long list of easy specialties.</s>
<s snum=66>Threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes, a bit of green pepper, a fresh white mushroom- any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook, and a meal a feast.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=67>Sure, for the most of us, a frankfurter is the favorite.</s>
<s snum=68>A story goes that a certain Herr Feuchtwanger of St.Louis, around 1883 served his sausages (grilled) and mustard to his fancy customers.</s>
<s snum=69>So that his customers should not soil their hands, Feuchtwanger issued white gloves.</s>
<s snum=70>Discovery that the gloves frequently left with the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise.</s>
<s snum=71>He had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks.</s>
<s snum=72>Years later, franks-in-buns were accepted as the ``first to go'' at the New York Polo Grounds.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=73>The nations's number one picnic treat is the skinless frankfurter- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or, more sedately, charcoal broiled on a portable grill.</s>
<s snum=74>Either way it's hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation.</s>
<s snum=75>To make the picnic frank come close to perfection, remember these tips:</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>-Score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through.</s>
<s snum=77>This permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>-Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns.</s>
<s snum=79>Bring along the conventional ones- catsup, pickle relish, mustard, mayonnaise- plus a few extras, such as tangy barbecue sauce, chive cream cheese, or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=80>-Using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns, too.</s>
<s snum=81>Watch closely while browning them, as it doesn't take long.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>-An unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in French dressing or a mixture of honey, lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic.</s>
<s snum=83>Broil or toast as usual.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>Contrary to popular opinion, ``a la mode'' doesn't mean ``with ice cream''- it just means, in the latest style.</s>
<s snum=85>Here are a couple of the latest, highly styled ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard!</s>
<s snum=86>You'll have the neighbor's eyes popping as well as their mouths watering!</s>
