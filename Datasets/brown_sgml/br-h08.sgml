<p>
<s snum=42>The ballet originated in Italy about 1450.</s>
<s snum=43>At that time it was a series of sophisticated social dances whose steps were often combined with other steps devised by the choreographer.</s>
<s snum=44>Ballet flowered in Italy during the next hundred years, and about 1550 was carried to France when the Italian princess, Catherine de Medicis, married the King of France.</s>

<p>
<s snum=49>The State Ballet of Rhode Island, the first incorporated group, was formed for the purpose of extending knowledge of the art of ballet in the Community, to promote interest in ballet performances, to contribute to the cultural life of the State, and to provide opportunity for gifted dance students who, for one reason or another, are unable to pursue a career and to develop others for the professional state; And now, therefore, do I, John A.

<hl>PROCLAMATION THANKSGIVING DAY BY JOHN A. NOTTE, JR. GOVERNOR</hl>
<p>
<s snum=52>As another Thanksgiving draws near, let us take time out from the often hectic pace of our lives to try and recapture the feelings that filled the hearts of the Pilgrims on the first Thanksgiving.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>The Pilgrims gathered to thank the Lord for His benevolence during their first year in the new land.</s>
<s snum=54>They had been through trying times, but their faith in the Almighty had given them the courage and the strength to meet and overcome the many problems and difficulties that were the price they had to pay for freedom.</s>
<s snum=55>And as the Pilgrims bowed their heads in humble gratitude, they shared another feeling- the anticipation of what the future held for them and their posterity.</s>
<s snum=56>They could not guess that from their concepts of liberty and freedom would some day be born a new nation that for years would be the symbol of hope to the oppressed countries of the world.</s>
<s snum=57>They simply turned to God filled with gratitude and faith.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=58>We who are living today may learn a valuable lesson from those who celebrated the first Thanksgiving Day.</s>
<s snum=59>The Lord has shown time and time again His love for us.</s>
<s snum=60>We have only to compare the liberty and high standard of living we enjoy in this great country with the oppression and frugality of other nations to realize with humble gratitude that God's Providence has been with us since the very beginning of our country.</s>
<s snum=61>And yet, accompanying our gratitude is the realization that we are living in a crucial time.</s>
<s snum=62>With world peace constantly being threatened, most of us regard the future skeptically, and even with fear.</s>
<s snum=63>It is at this time that we should imitate the Pilgrims by accompanying our prayers of thanks with the conviction that we shall continue to be in dire need for the Lord's protection in the future, if we are to have peace; Now, therefore, do I, John A. Notte, Jr., Governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, proclaim Thursday, November 23rd, 1961, as Thanksgiving Day, </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>And so, let us remember on this day not only to thank the Almighty Who gave hope and courage to the Pilgrims, but also to place our trust in Him that He will continue to protect us in the future as He has in the past.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=65>In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 21st day of November, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one and of Independence, the one hundred and eighty-sixth.</s>
