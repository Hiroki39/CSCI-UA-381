<s snum=1>In tradition and in poetry, the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony.</s>
<s snum=2>The partners each bring to it unselfish love, and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=3>At its most ecstatic moments, husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares.</s>
<s snum=4>Everything else is closed away.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=5>This is the ideal.</s>
<s snum=6>But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved.</s>
<s snum=7>Instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship.</s>
<s snum=8>In the past, it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive.</s>
<s snum=9>But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=10>In a growing number of American homes, marriage counselors report, the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships.</s>
<s snum=11>It is she who decides the time, the place, the surroundings, and the frequency of the sexual act.</s>
<s snum=12>It is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics- not the husband.</s>
<s snum=13>The whole act is tailored to her pleasure, and not to theirs.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=14>Beyond a certain point, of course, no woman can be dominant- nature has seen to that.</s>
<s snum=15>But there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=16>Of course, there remain many ``old-fashioned'' marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy.</s>
<s snum=17>Yet even in these marriages, psychologists say, wives are asserting themselves more strongly.</s>
<s snum=18>The meekest, most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's or grandmother's standards.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>To many experts, this trend was inevitable.</s>
<s snum=20>They consider it simply a sign of our times.</s>
<s snum=21>Our society has ``emancipated'' the woman, giving her new independence and new authority.</s>
<s snum=22>It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=23>``The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum'', declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone, medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent book, Release From Sexual Tensions.</s>
<s snum=24>``It reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself.</s>
<s snum=25>A world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive, too''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous.</s>
<s snum=27>It can, in fact, wreck a marriage.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=28>When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires, she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her.</s>
<s snum=29>And she begins to regard him as savage, bestial and unworthy.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>On the other hand, wifely supremacy demeans the husband, saps his self-respect, and robs him of his masculinity.</s>
<s snum=31>He is a target of ridicule to his wife, and often- since private affairs rarely remain private- to the outside world as well.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=32>``A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's maleness'', declares Dr. Calderone.</s>
<s snum=33>This opinion is supported by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists, Dr. Maurice E. Linden, director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=34>``When the roles of husband and wife are reversed, so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower'', Dr. Linden says, ``the effects on their whole relationship, sexual and otherwise, can be disastrous''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>In one extreme case, cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist, an office worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded.</s>
<s snum=36>To win her favors, her husband first took an additional job, then desperately began to embezzle from his employer.</s>
<s snum=37>Caught at last, he was sentenced to prison.</s>
<s snum=38>While he was in custody his wife divorced him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=39>More typical is the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage counselor.</s>
<s snum=40>This woman repeatedly complained she was ``too tired'' for marital relations.</s>
<s snum=41>To please her, her husband assumed some of the domestic chores.</s>
<s snum=42>Finally, he was cooking, washing dishes, bathing the children, and even ironing- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=43>One wife, described by a New York psychologist, so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule, writing it down right between the weekly ~PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood card parties.</s>
<s snum=44>Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis.</s>
<s snum=45>After every money argument, she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=46>Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=47>The wife is likely to be young, sophisticated, smart as a whip- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage.</s>
<s snum=48>She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>The husband is usually a well-educated professional, preoccupied with his job- often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is: ``Don't rock the boat''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=50>Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage.</s>
<s snum=51>Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself, he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>More often, though, he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>Some psychologists, in fact, suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives.</s>
<s snum=54>The wife's attempt at control, these psychologists contend, is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=55>Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative.</s>
<s snum=56>Unless her husband also desires sex, the act cannot be consummated.</s>
<s snum=57>Generally, however, in such marriages as those cited, the husband is at his wife's mercy.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=58>``The pattern'', says Dr. Morton Schillinger, psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy, ``is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly, virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=59>No one seriously contends, of course, that the domineering wife is, sexually speaking, a new character in our world.</s>
<s snum=60>After all, the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing, in literature and on the stage, as Dr. Schillinger points out.</s>
<s snum=61>There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=62>Furthermore, Dr. Calderone says, a certain number of docile, retiring men always have been around.</s>
<s snum=63>They aren't ``frigid'' and they aren't homosexual; they're just restrained in all of life.</s>
<s snum=64>They like to be dominated.</s>
<s snum=65>One such man once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik, New York psychiatrist, that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor.</s>
<s snum=66>Asked why, he replied primly:</s>
<s snum=67>``Because that's no activity for a gentleman''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>But such cases were, in the past, unusual.</s>
<s snum=69>Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male- even the Bible appears to endorse the concept.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=70>Family survival on our own Western frontier, for example, could quite literally depend on a man's strength and ability to bring home the bacon; and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything, including the marriage bed.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring Life With Father manner.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=72>In those days, a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere.</s>
<s snum=73>``Grandma wasn't expected to like it'', Dr. Marion Hilliard, the late Toronto gynecologist, once summed up the attitude of the '90s.</s>
<s snum=74>Wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as ``used'' by their husbands- and, history indicates, they often quite literally were.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>When was the turning point?</s>
<s snum=76>When did women begin to assert themselves sexually?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=77>Some date it from woman suffrage, others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace, still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin.</s>
<s snum=78>Virtually everyone agrees, however, that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=79>Left alone while her husband was miles away in the city, the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male.</s>
<s snum=80>Circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing, money-handling and home maintenance.</s>
<s snum=81>She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless.</s>
<s snum=82>She liked this taste of authority and independence, and, with darkness, was not likely to give it up.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=83>``Very few wives'', says Dr. Calderone, ``who balance the checkbook, fix the car, choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen, are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned.</s>
<s snum=84>A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=85>And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response.</s>
<s snum=86>Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax.</s>
<s snum=87>They began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for response.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=88>In fact, the noted psychologist and sex researcher, Dr. Albert Ellis, has declared flatly that women are ``sexually superior'' to men.</s>
<s snum=89>According to Dr. Ellis, the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner.</s>
<s snum=90>Not surprisingly, Dr. Ellis says, some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=91>Yet, paradoxically, according to Dr. Maurice Linden, many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them.</s>
<s snum=92>An aggressive woman wants a man to demand, not knuckle under.</s>
<s snum=93>``When the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness'', Dr. Linden says, ``the wife, in turn, finds him inadequate.</s>
<s snum=94>Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=95>One such wife, Dr. Linden says, became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man.</s>
<s snum=96>But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover, too, had been conquered and reduced to passivity.</s>
<s snum=97>Then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=98>In some cases, however, domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary, triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need.</s>
<s snum=99>Thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed- the one place he can still be champion.</s>
<s snum=100>If his on-the-job problems work out, he may return to his old pattern.</s>
<s snum=101>Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man- or his wife- because he or she feels age creeping up.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=102>On the other hand, a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive- asking, psychologists say, for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable.</s>
<s snum=103>Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted, flattered or coaxed, simply because she needs her ego lifted.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=104>In any case, Dr. Calderone remarks, such problems are a couple's own affair, and can't always be measured by a general yardstick.</s>
<s snum=105>``As long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex, it makes little difference if one or the other dominates'', Dr. Calderone declares.</s>
<s snum=106>``The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=107>Other experts say, however, that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period, it is likely to shake the marriage.</s>
<s snum=108>And just as domination today often begins with the wife, so the cure generally must lie with the husband.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=109>``To get a marriage back where it belongs'', comments Dr. Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute, ``the husband must take some very basic steps.</s>
<s snum=110>He must begin, paradoxically, by becoming more selfish.</s>
<s snum=111>He must become more expressive of his own desires, more demanding and less 'understanding'''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=112>Too many husbands, Dr. Schillinger continues, worry about ``how well they're doing'', and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play.</s>
