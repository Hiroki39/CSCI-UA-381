<p>
<s snum=1>But the police have dropped the case.</s>
<s snum=2>I want you to go to Pearson City and find out why- first-hand stuff for your modern crime series.</s>
<s snum=3>Take the same train Diana Beauclerk took and get there at the same time.</s>
<s snum=4>Go to the same hotel and occupy the same suite- 1105``.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=5>``Will the hotel rent it so soon after the crime''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=6>``Why not?</s>
<s snum=7>The police have finished with it.</s>
<s snum=8>Besides, the number of the suite hasn't been published in any newspaper.</s>
<s snum=9>To the hotel people, you'll just be an innocent tourist who happens to ask for that particular suite''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=10>``Still, they may not want to rent it''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=11>``That's your headache.</s>
<s snum=12>Once inside, keep your eyes open''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=13>``For what''!</s>
<s snum=14>Alec was growing more and more skeptical.</s>
<s snum=15>``The police will have gone over every square inch of the place with a fine-tooth comb.</s>
<s snum=16>The hotel people will have scoured and vacuumed it.</s>
<s snum=17>Ten to one, it's even been redecorated''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=18>``There's always a chance they may have overlooked something'', returned the chief.</s>
<s snum=19>``I'm betting on that chance.</s>
<s snum=20>Interview the bellboy and chambermaid who waited on Beauclerk.</s>
<s snum=21>Study the topography of the suite.</s>
<s snum=22>Soak up local color.</s>
<s snum=23>Reenact everything Beauclerk did.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=24>Try to imagine you're going to be murdered yourself- between eleven p.m. and one a.m. the night you arrive``.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=25>Alec smirked.</s>
<s snum=26>``Cheerful way to spend an evening''!</s>
<s snum=27>A sudden thought wiped the smirk from his face.</s>
<s snum=28>``Suppose the murderer should return to the scene of the crime''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=29>The chief's eyes gleamed.</s>
<s snum=30>He spoke softly.</s>
<s snum=31>``That is exactly what I'm hoping for.</s>
<s snum=32>After all, the murderer is still at large.</s>
<s snum=33>And the key to the suite is still missing''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=34>On the train Alec refreshed his memory of the Beauclerk case by reading teletype flimsies- spot-news stories about the crime sent out by the Pearson City Star, a member of the Syndicate Press.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>Diana Beauclerk was a second-rate actress living in New York.</s>
<s snum=36>Two weeks ago she had gone west to Pearson City.</s>
<s snum=37>Daniel Forbes, her divorced husband, lived there.</s>
<s snum=38>So did the firm of lawyers who had got her the divorce, Kimball and Stacy.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=39>She reached Pearson City at nine p.m. and went straight to the Hotel Westmore.</s>
<s snum=40>She telephoned the junior partner of her law firm, Martin Stacy, and asked him to call at her hotel that evening.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=41>At the time of her divorce Forbes had promised to pay her a lump sum in lieu of further alimony if she remarried.</s>
<s snum=42>According to Stacy, she told him she was planning to remarry and she wanted him to ask Forbes for the lump sum.</s>
<s snum=43>Stacy replied that it would bankrupt Forbes, who had just sunk all his money in a real estate venture.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=44>Stacy said he left her suite at nine forty-five p.m..</s>
<s snum=45>She was in good health and spirits, but still determined to get the money from Forbes.</s>
<s snum=46>No one saw Stacy leave.</s>
<s snum=47>No other visitor inquired for her that evening.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=48>Next morning she was found dead in her suite with a bullet from a .22-caliber Colt revolver in her brain.</s>
<s snum=49>According to the medical examiner, she was shot between eleven p.m. and one a.m..</s>
<s snum=50>Her door was locked and the key was missing.</s>
<s snum=51>So was the gun.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>When Alec finished reading he was sure that either Forbes or Stacy had killed Diana Beauclerk.</s>
<s snum=53>Forbes had motive and Stacy had opportunity.</s>
<s snum=54>Find a motive for Stacy or an opportunity for Forbes and the case would be solved.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=55>The Hotel Westmore proved to be one of the older hotels in Pearson City, and definitely second-rate.</s>
<s snum=56>Alec's first impression of the lobby was gloomy, Victorian dignity- black walnut and red plush, a black and white tiled floor, and Persian rugs.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=57>He studied the night clerk as a man measures an adversary.</s>
<s snum=58>``I'd like the room I had the last time''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=59>``Certainly, sir''.</s>
<s snum=60>The clerk was young and limp, with a tired smile.</s>
<s snum=61>``Do you recall the number''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=62>``It was 1105''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=63>The clerk's smile congealed.</s>
<s snum=64>``That suite is taken''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=65>Alec's glance went to a chart of guest names and room numbers hanging on the wall behind the clerk.</s>
<s snum=66>Opposite the number 1105 stood one word: Unoccupied.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=67>The clerk's glance followed Alec's.</s>
<s snum=68>``We have better rooms vacant now'', he babbled.</s>
<s snum=69>``Larger and more comfortable.</s>
<s snum=70>At the same rate''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>Alec's face was dark, blunt, and sulky.</s>
<s snum=72>He always looked impertinent and he could look dangerous.</s>
<s snum=73>He was looking dangerous now.</s>
<s snum=74>He raised his voice.</s>
<s snum=75>``Anything wrong with the plumbing in 1105''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>There was a sudden stillness in the lobby.</s>
<s snum=77>Two women, who had been chattering like parrots, were struck dumb.</s>
<s snum=78>A man, lighting a match for his cigar, paused until the flame burned his fingers.</s>
<s snum=79>Even the bellboys on their bench were listening.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=80>The clerk's eyes flickered.</s>
<s snum=81>``Of course not''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>``Anybody with a contagious disease been in there''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=83>``No''!</s>
<s snum=84>The clerk was almost hysterical.</s>
<s snum=85>``It's just that- well, 1105 is being redecorated''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=86>``I don't believe it''.</s>
<s snum=87>Alec leaned on the desk, holding the clerk's eyes with his.</s>
<s snum=88>``Suppose you tell me the real reason'', he drawled.</s>
<s snum=89>``There might be a story in it''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=90>``St-story''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=91>``I'm with the Syndicated Press, Feature Service.</s>
<s snum=92>Either I get the story- or I get the suite''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=93>It was blackmail and the clerk knew it.</s>
<s snum=94>``There is no story'', he piped tremulously.</s>
<s snum=95>``Front!</s>
<s snum=96>Show this gentleman to 1105''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=97>The stillness persisted as Alec followed a bellboy across the lobby to the elevator.</s>
<s snum=98>He could feel eyes on his back.</s>
<s snum=99>He wished it had not been necessary to announce the number of his suite quite so publicly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=100>The corridor on the eleventh floor was dimly lighted by electric globes at intervals of thirty feet.</s>
<s snum=101>A thick, crimson carpet muffled every footfall.</s>
<s snum=102>At the end of the corridor Alec noticed a door marked: Fire Stairs.</s>
<s snum=103>It was a neat setup for murder.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=104>The bellboy unlocked a white door numbered 1105.</s>
<s snum=105>The room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the window.</s>
<s snum=106>A few snowflakes sifted down through that theatrical red glow, languid as falling feathers.</s>
<s snum=107>Hastily the boy switched on a ceiling light.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=108>The room looked normal and even commonplace.</s>
<s snum=109>There was no hint of a violent struggle now.</s>
<s snum=110>Deal furniture with a mahogany finish was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department store.</s>
<s snum=111>The blue rug was suspiciously bright and new.</s>
<s snum=112>It had never been stained with blood.</s>
<s snum=113>Table covers and towels were clean, ashtrays empty and supplied with fresh matches.</s>
<s snum=114>The mirror over the bureau was a blank eye, round and innocent.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=115>Alec played the part of an innocent tourist.</s>
<s snum=116>``Is there anything wrong with this room''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>``N-no''.</s>
<s snum=118>The boy dropped his eyes.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=119>``Afraid you'll lose your job if you don't keep your mouth shut''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=120>The boy raised his eyes.</s>
<s snum=121>``Listen, mister.</s>
<s snum=122>If you want my advice, pack up and take the next train back to New York''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=123>``Were you on duty here two weeks ago''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=124>The boy hesitated.</s>
<s snum=125>Then, ``I'm not talking.</s>
<s snum=126>But I wouldn't spend a night in here for a million bucks''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=127>He was in a hurry to get out of the room.</s>
<s snum=128>Alec gave him a tip and let him go.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=129>Alone, Alec examined the doors.</s>
<s snum=130>There were three- one leading to a bathroom, one to the hall, and one to the room next door which was immovable- locked or bolted on the other side.</s>
<s snum=131>Alec locked the hall door and put the key with his watch on the bedside table.</s>
<s snum=132>It was just quarter of nine.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=133>As he ranged his belongings on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust on the dark surface of the wood beyond the linen cover.</s>
<s snum=134>Not gray like the dust that collects in an unused room, but white.</s>
<s snum=135>Women didn't use white face powder nowadays, he recalled.</s>
<s snum=136>They used pink, tan, or cream powder.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=137>Alec glanced into the bathroom.</s>
<s snum=138>Blood in the bathtub where the murderer appears to have washed his hands.</s>
<s snum=139>It seemed clean now, but Alec decided against a bath.</s>
<s snum=140>He crawled into bed and switched off the light.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=141>In the darkness he could see the rosy reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window.</s>
<s snum=142>It winked as steadily as a metronome- on, off- on, off.</s>
<s snum=143>In less than five minutes Alec was asleep.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=144>He never knew just what woke him.</s>
<s snum=145>Yet suddenly he was wide-awake.</s>
<s snum=146>There was no sound and apparently no movement in the room except the noiseless pulsation of the red light on the wall.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=147>He lay still, listening to the silence, watching the light.</s>
<s snum=148>Somewhere in the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes- midnight.</s>
<s snum=149>According to the medical examiner she was shot between eleven p.m. and one a.m..</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=150>Alec heard a faint sound.</s>
<s snum=151>His heart seemed to swell and knock against the wall of his chest.</s>
<s snum=152>For the sound was inside the room.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=153>he let his eyelids droop and breathed heavily, feigning sleep.</s>
<s snum=154>The sound was coming nearer.</s>
<s snum=155>A monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall, distorted and indefinable.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=156>When the neon sign faded out, the shadow disappeared.</s>
<s snum=157>When the neon sign flashed on, the shadow was still there.</s>
<s snum=158>It stretched to an impossible height, climbing the wall to the ceiling.</s>
<s snum=159>That meant that something between the light and its reflection on the wall was moving closer to the source of the light- in this case, the window.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=160>Cautiously Alec tensed his muscles, ready to jump.</s>
<s snum=161>The bedsprings betrayed him with a creak.</s>
<s snum=162>The shadow vanished.</s>
<s snum=163>Someone had moved beyond the range of the light from the window.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=164>Abandoning caution, Alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch.</s>
<s snum=165>Before he could snap it on, a stinging blow caught him in the ribs.</s>
<s snum=166>He lashed out blindly with his right.</s>
<s snum=167>There was a thick, squashy crack of fist on flesh.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=168>Something hard grazed his knuckles.</s>
<s snum=169>He put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought to be.</s>
<s snum=170>Rough cloth rasped his fist.</s>
<s snum=171>There was a grunt, curiously inarticulate, like that of an animal in pain.</s>
<s snum=172>Something heavy shook the floor as it dropped.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=173>Alec waited a moment, on guard.</s>
<s snum=174>Nothing happened.</s>
<s snum=175>Again he groped for the light switch.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=176>The blue rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room.</s>
<s snum=177>On the bare floorboards a man lay face down.</s>
<s snum=178>He had a short, heavy, powerful body.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=179>Alec turned him over and discovered a round, lumpy face with narrow, slanting eyes- a primitive Tartar face from Russia or the Balkans.</s>
<s snum=180>The man's shoes were too pointed, his overcoat too broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the waist.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=181>There was a slight bulge under the left armpit- a shoulder holster.</s>
<s snum=182>Alec promptly removed the gun.</s>
<s snum=183>He was familiar with this type.</s>
<s snum=184>He had seen it in the lineup at Police Headquarters in New York, in Broadway night clubs and Seventh Avenue pool rooms, in the criminal courts.</s>
<s snum=185>But he was surprised to meet it here.</s>
<s snum=186>Diana Beauclerk had no connection with the underworld.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=187>A professional gunman would not have killed her with a weapon of such small caliber as a .22.</s>
<s snum=188>Nor would he choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be so much safer to take his victim for a one-way ride on a lonely country road.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=189>The man's eyelids fluttered.</s>
<s snum=190>He opened his eyes.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=191>``What are you doing here''? demanded Alec.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=192>The man made no reply.</s>
<s snum=193>His eyes were dazed.</s>
<s snum=194>His lips were bruised and swollen where Alec had hit him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=195>``Did you kill Diana Beauclerk''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=196>Alec expected an indignant denial, but there was no response at all.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=197>``Oh, come on, snap out of it!</s>
<s snum=198>Or I'll turn you over to the police''!</s>
<s snum=199>The silence was getting on Alec's nerves.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=200>The man opened his mouth, but no words came.</s>
<s snum=201>Only that curious, animal grunting Alec had heard during their fight.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=202>``Don't you speak English''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=203>The man opened his mouth wider.</s>
<s snum=204>A forefinger pointed toward his gullet.</s>
<s snum=205>Alec leaned forward to look.</s>
<s snum=206>There were hideous scars inside the throat and the palate was mutilated.</s>
