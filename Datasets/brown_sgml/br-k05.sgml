<s snum=1>Payne dismounted in Madison Place and handed the reins to Herold.</s>
<s snum=2>There was a fog, which increased the darkness of the night.</s>
<s snum=3>Two gas lamps were no more than a misleading glow.</s>
<s snum=4>He might have been anywhere or nowhere.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=5>The pretence was that he was delivering a prescription from Dr. Verdi.</s>
<s snum=6>Secretary of State Seward was a sick man.</s>
<s snum=7>The idea had come from Herold, who had once been a chemist's clerk.</s>
<s snum=8>The sick were always receiving medicines.</s>
<s snum=9>No one would question such an errand.</s>
<s snum=10>The bottle was filled up with flour.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=11>Before Payne loomed the Old Clubhouse, Seward's home, where Key had once been killed.</s>
<s snum=12>Now it would have another death.</s>
<s snum=13>From the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the gentry.</s>
<s snum=14>He clomped heavily up the stoop and rang the bell.</s>
<s snum=15>Like the bell at Mass, the doorbell was pitched too high.</s>
<s snum=16>It was still Good Friday, after all.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=17>A nigger boy opened the door.</s>
<s snum=18>Payne did not notice him.</s>
<s snum=19>He was thinking chiefly of Cap.</s>
<s snum=20>If their schedules were to synchronize, there was no point in wasting time.</s>
<s snum=21>He pushed his way inside.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=22>For a moment the hall confused him.</s>
<s snum=23>This was the largest house he had ever been in, almost the largest building, except for a hotel.</s>
<s snum=24>He had no idea where Seward's room would be.</s>
<s snum=25>In the half darkness the banisters gleamed, and the hall seemed enormous.</s>
<s snum=26>Above him somewhere were the bedrooms.</s>
<s snum=27>Seward would be up there.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=28>He explained his errand, but without bothering much to make it plausible, for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army.</s>
<s snum=29>He did not really want to kill, but as in the sexual act, there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be downed, even while you watched yourself giving way to it.</s>
<s snum=30>He was no longer worried.</s>
<s snum=31>Everything would be all right.</s>
<s snum=32>He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=33>Still, the sensation always surprised him.</s>
<s snum=34>It was a thrill he felt no part in.</s>
<s snum=35>He could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body did these quick, appalling, and efficient things.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=36>He brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs.</s>
<s snum=37>They were carpeted, but made for pumps and congress gaiters, not the great clodhoppers he wore.</s>
<s snum=38>The sound of his footsteps was like a muffled drum.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=39>At the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there angrily in a dressing gown.</s>
<s snum=40>He stopped and whispered his errand.</s>
<s snum=41>Young Frederick Seward held out his hand.</s>
<s snum=42>Panting a little, Payne shook his head.</s>
<s snum=43>Dr. Verdi had told him to deliver his package in person.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=44>Frederick Seward said his father was sleeping, and then went through a pantomime at his father's door, to prove the statement.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=45>``Very well'', Payne said.</s>
<s snum=46>``I will go''.</s>
<s snum=47>He smiled, but now that he knew where the elder Seward was, he did not intend to go.</s>
<s snum=48>He pulled out his pistol and fired it.</s>
<s snum=49>It made no sound.</s>
<s snum=50>It had misfired.</s>
<s snum=51>Reversing it, he smashed the butt down on Frederick Seward's head, over and over again.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>It was the first blow that was always difficult.</s>
<s snum=53>After that, violence was exultantly easy.</s>
<s snum=54>He got caught up into it and became a different person.</s>
<s snum=55>Only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless, so that he would puzzle over it for days, whereas at the time it had seemed quite real.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=56>The nigger boy fled down the stairs, screaming, ``Murder''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=57>It was not murder at all.</s>
<s snum=58>Payne was more methodical than that.</s>
<s snum=59>He was merely clearing a way to what he had to do.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=60>He ran for the sick room, found his pistol was broken, and threw it away.</s>
<s snum=61>A knife would do.</s>
<s snum=62>From childhood he had known all about knives.</s>
<s snum=63>Someone blocked the door from inside.</s>
<s snum=64>He smashed it in and tumbled into darkness.</s>
<s snum=65>He saw only dimly moving figures, but when he slashed them they yelled and fled.</s>
<s snum=66>He went for the bed, jumped on it, and struck where he could, repeatedly.</s>
<s snum=67>It was like finally getting into one's own nightmares to punish one's dreams.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>Two men pulled him off.</s>
<s snum=69>Nobody said anything.</s>
<s snum=70>Payne hacked at their arms.</s>
<s snum=71>There was a lady there, in a nightdress.</s>
<s snum=72>He would not have wanted to hurt a lady.</s>
<s snum=73>Another man approached, this one fully dressed.</s>
<s snum=74>When the knife went into his chest, he went down at once.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>``I'm mad'', shouted Payne, as he ran out into the hall.</s>
<s snum=76>``I'm mad'', and only wished he had been.</s>
<s snum=77>That would have made things so much easier.</s>
<s snum=78>But he was not mad.</s>
<s snum=79>He was only dreaming.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=80>He clattered down the stairs and out of the door.</s>
<s snum=81>Somewhere in the fog, the nigger boy was still yelling murder.</s>
<s snum=82>One always wakes up, even from one's own dreams.</s>
<s snum=83>The clammy air revived him.</s>
<s snum=84>Herold, he saw, had fled.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=85>Well, one did not expect much of people like Herold.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=86>He unhitched his horse, walked it away, mounted, and spurred it on.</s>
<s snum=87>The nigger boy was close behind him.</s>
<s snum=88>Then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone.</s>
<s snum=89>He rode on and on.</s>
<s snum=90>He had no idea where he was.</s>
<s snum=91>After some time he came to an open field.</s>
<s snum=92>An open field was better than a building, that was for sure, so he dismounted, turned off the horse, and plunged through the grass.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=93>He felt curiously sleepy, the world seemed far away; he knew he should get to Cap, but he didn't know how.</s>
<s snum=94>He was sure, for he had done as he was told, hadn't he?</s>
<s snum=95>Cap would find him and take care of him.</s>
<s snum=96>So choosing a good tree, he clambered up into it, found a comfortable notch, and curled up in it to sleep, like the tousled bear he was, with his hands across his chest, as though surfeited with honey.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=97>Violence always made him tired, but he was not frightened.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=98>In Boston, Edwin Booth was winding up a performance of A New Way to Pay Old Debts.</s>
<s snum=99>It was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more.</s>
<s snum=100>Acting soothed him.</s>
<s snum=101>On a stage he always knew what to do, and tonight, to judge by the applause, he must be doing it better than usual.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=102>As Sir Giles Overreach (how often had he had to play that part, who did not believe a word of it), he raised his arm and declaimed: ``Where is my honour now''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=103>That was one of the high spots of the play.</s>
<s snum=104>The audience, as usual, loved it.</s>
<s snum=105>He was delighted to see them so happy.</s>
<s snum=106>If he had any worries, it was only the small ones, about Mother in New York, and his daughter Edwina and what she might be doing at this hour, with her Aunt Asia, in Philadelphia.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=107>Everyone is ambivalent about his profession, if he has practised it long enough, but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those unseen people out there, who might cheer you or boo you, but that was largely, though not entirely, up to you.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=108>They made the world seem friendly somehow, though he knew it was not.</s>
</p>
<hl>/7,</hl>
<p>
<s snum=109>Wilkes was quite right about one thing.</s>
<s snum=110>Laura Keene had been in the green room.</s>
<s snum=111>The commotion had brought her into the wings.</s>
<s snum=112>Since she could not act, one part suited her as well as any other, and so she was the first person to offer Mr. Lincoln a glass of water, holding it up to the box, high above her head, to Miss Harris, who had asked for it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=113>She had been one of the first to collect her wits.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=114>It was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience, as that they had been stunned already.</s>
<s snum=115>Most of them had seen Our American Cousin before, and unless Miss Keene was on stage, there was not much to it.</s>
<s snum=116>The theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>The stage had been empty, except for Harry Hawk, doing his star monologue.</s>
<s snum=118>The audience was fond of Harry Hawk, he was a dear, in or out of character, but he was not particularly funny.</s>
<s snum=119>At the end of the monologue the audience would applaud.</s>
<s snum=120>Meanwhile it looked at the scenery.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=121>``Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, you sockdologizing old mantrap''! said Trenchard, otherwise Hawk.</s>
<s snum=122>There was always a pause here, before the next line.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=123>That was when the gun went off.</s>
<s snum=124>Yet even that explosion did not mean much.</s>
<s snum=125>Guns were going off all over Washington City these days, because of the celebrations, and the theatre was not soundproof.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=126>Then the audience saw a small, dim figure appear at the edge of the Presidential box.</s>
<s snum=127>``Sic semper tyrannis'', it said mildly.</s>
<s snum=128>Booth had delivered his line.</s>
<s snum=129>Behind him billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=130>They strained forward.</s>
<s snum=131>They had not heard what had been said.</s>
<s snum=132>They had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily.</s>
<s snum=133>The figure leapt from the box, almost lost its balance, the flag draped there tore in the air, the figure landed on its left leg, fell on its hands, and pressed itself up.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=134>Harry Hawk still had his arm raised towards the wings.</s>
<s snum=135>His speech faltered.</s>
<s snum=136>He did not lower his arm.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=137>The figure was so theatrically dressed, that it was as though a character from some other play had blundered into this one.</s>
<s snum=138>The play for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of The Octoroon.</s>
<s snum=139>This figure looked like the slave dealer from that.</s>
<s snum=140>But it also looked like a toad, hopping away from the light.</s>
<s snum=141>There was something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=142>Then it disappeared into the wings.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=143>Harry Hawk had not shifted position, but he at last lowered his arm.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=144>Mrs. Lincoln screamed.</s>
<s snum=145>There was no mistaking that scream.</s>
<s snum=146>It was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do.</s>
<s snum=147>Yet this scream had a different note in it.</s>
<s snum=148>That absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them awake like a pail of water.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=149>Clara Harris, one of the guests in the box, stood up and demanded water.</s>
<s snum=150>Her action was involuntary.</s>
<s snum=151>When something unexpected happened, one always asked for water if one were a woman, brandy if one were a man.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=152>Mrs. lincoln screamed again.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=153>In the Presidential box someone leaned over the balustrade and yelled: ``He has shot the President''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=154>That got everybody up.</s>
<s snum=155>On the stage, Harry Hawk began to weep.</s>
<s snum=156>Laura Keene brushed by him with the glass of water.</s>
<s snum=157>The crowd began to move.</s>
<s snum=158>In Washington City everyone lived in a bubble of plots, and one death might attract another.</s>
<s snum=159>It was not exactly panic they gave way to, but they could not just sit there.</s>
<s snum=160>The beehive voices, for no one could bear silence, drowned out the sound of Mrs. Lincoln's weeping.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=161>At the rear of the auditorium, upstairs, some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor.</s>
<s snum=162>It would not give.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=163>A Dr. Charles Taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to hoist him up to the box.</s>
<s snum=164>In the audience a man named Ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob, on the same principle which had led Miss Harris to demand water.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=165>Someone opened the corridor door from the inside, and called for a doctor.</s>
<s snum=166>Somehow Dr. Charles Leale was forced through the mob and squeezed out into the dingy corridor.</s>
<s snum=167>He went straight to the Presidential box.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=168>As usual, Mrs. Lincoln had lost her head, but nobody blamed her for doing so now.</s>
<s snum=169>There was a little blood on the hem of her dress, for the assassin had slashed Miss Harris's companion, Major Rathbone, with a knife.</s>
<s snum=170>Rathbone said he was bleeding to death.</s>
<s snum=171>By the look of him he wasn't that far gone.</s>
