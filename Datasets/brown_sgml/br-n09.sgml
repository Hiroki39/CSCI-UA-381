<p>
<s snum=1>Miraculously, she found exactly the right statement.</s>
<s snum=2>She began it deliberately, so that none of her words would be lost on him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=3>``I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord.</s>
<s snum=4>I'm well aware that you've got a pedigree as long as my leg, and that I don't amount to anything.</s>
<s snum=5>But''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=6>``But it don't matter a-tall'', Lord supplied fondly.</s>
<s snum=7>``To me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams, an' the sweetest flower that grows''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=8>Beaming idiotically, he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her.</s>
<s snum=9>She yanked away from him furiously.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=10>``You shut up!</s>
<s snum=11>shu-tt up-pp!</s>
<s snum=12>I've got something to say to you, and by God you're going to listen.</s>
<s snum=13>Do you hear me?</s>
<s snum=14>You're going to listen''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=15>Lord nodded agreeably.</s>
<s snum=16>He said he wanted very much to listen.</s>
<s snum=17>He knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important, as well as pleasin' to the ear, and he didn't want to miss a word of it.</s>
<s snum=18>So would she mind speaking a little louder?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>``I think you stink, Tom Lord!</s>
<s snum=20>I think you're mean and hateful and stupid, and- louder''? said Joyce.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=21>``Uh-huh.</s>
<s snum=22>So I can hear you while I'm checkin' the car.</s>
<s snum=23>Looks like we might be in for a speck of trouble''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=24>He opened the door and got out.</s>
<s snum=25>He waited at the car side for a moment, looking down at her expectantly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>``Well?</s>
<s snum=27>Wasn't you goin' to say somethin'''?</s>
<s snum=28>Then, helpfully, as she merely stared at him in weary silence, ``Maybe you could write it down for me, huh?</s>
<s snum=29>Print it in real big letters, an' I can cipher it out later''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>``Aah, go on'', she said.</s>
<s snum=31>``Just go the hell on''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=32>He grinned, nodded, and walked around to the front of the car.</s>
<s snum=33>Lips pursed mournfully, he stared down at its crazily sagging left side.</s>
<s snum=34>Then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots, peered into the orderly chaos of axle, shock absorber, and spring.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>He went prone on his stomach, the better to pursue his examination.</s>
<s snum=36>After a time, he straightened again, brushing the red Permian dust from his hands, slapping it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored, twenty-five-dollar shirt.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=37>He wore no gun- a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country.</s>
<s snum=38>Never, he'd once told Joyce, had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun.</s>
<s snum=39>And he really feels that way, she thought.</s>
<s snum=40>That's really all he's got, all he is.</s>
<s snum=41>Just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package.</s>
<s snum=42>If I could make myself feel the same way.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=43>She studied him hopefully, yearningly; against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis.</s>
<s snum=44>Here in the God-forsaken place, the westerly end of nowhere, Tom Lord looked almost insignificant, almost contemptible.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=45>He was handsome, with his coal-black hair and eyes, his fine-chiseled features.</s>
<s snum=46>But she'd known plenty of handsomer guys, and, conceding his good looks, what was there left?</s>
<s snum=47>He wasn't a big man; rather on the medium side.</s>
<s snum=48>Neither was he very powerful of build.</s>
<s snum=49>He could move very quickly, she knew (although he seldom found occasion to do so), but he was more wiry than truly strong.</s>
<s snum=50>And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=51>Just nothing, she told herself.</s>
<s snum=52>Just so darned sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on everyone.</s>
<s snum=53>But, by gosh, I want him and I'm going to have him!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=54>He caught her eye, came back around the car with the boot-wearer's teetering, half-mincing walk.</s>
<s snum=55>Why did these yokels still wear boots, anyway, when most had scarcely sat a horse in years?</s>
<s snum=56>He slid in at her side, tucked a cigar into his mouth, and politely proffered one to her.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=57>``Oh, cut it out, Tom''! she snapped.</s>
<s snum=58>``Can't you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=59>``This ain't your brand, maybe'', Lord suggested.</s>
<s snum=60>``Or maybe you just don't feel like a cigar''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=61>``I feel like getting back to town, that's what I feel like!</s>
<s snum=62>Now, are you going to take me or am I supposed to walk''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=63>``Might get there faster walkin''', Lord drawled, ``seein' as how I got a busted front spring.</s>
<s snum=64>On the other hand, howsomever, maybe you wouldn't either.</s>
<s snum=65>I figger it's probl'y a sixty-five-mile walk, and I c'n maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of hours''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=66>``How- with what?</s>
<s snum=67>There's nothing out here but rattlesnakes''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>``Now, ain't it the truth''?</s>
<s snum=69>Lord laughed with secret amusement.</s>
<s snum=70>``Not a danged thing but rattlesnakes, so I reckon I'll get the boss rattler to help me''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>``Tom!</s>
<s snum=72>For God's sake''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=73>``Looky''.</s>
<s snum=74>He pointed, cutting her off.</s>
<s snum=75>``See that wildcat''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>She saw it then, the distant derrick of the wildcat- a test well in unexplored country.</s>
<s snum=77>And even with her limited knowledge of such things, she knew that the car could be repaired there; sufficiently, at least, to get them back into town.</s>
<s snum=78>A wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency.</s>
<s snum=79>He had to depend on himself, since he was invariably miles and hours away from others.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=80>``Well, let's get going'', she said impatiently.</s>
<s snum=81>``I''- She broke off, frowning.</s>
<s snum=82>``What did you mean by that rattlesnake gag?</s>
<s snum=83>Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>``Why, I meant what I said'', Lord declared.</s>
<s snum=85>``What else would I mean, anyways''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=86>She looked at him, lips compressed.</s>
<s snum=87>Then, with a shrug of pretended indifference, she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her make-up.</s>
<s snum=88>In his mood, it was the best way to handle him; that is, to show no curiosity whatsoever.</s>
<s snum=89>Otherwise, she would be baited into a tantrum- teased and provoked until she lost control of herself, and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of Tom Lord Vs. Joyce Lakewood.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=90>The car lurched along at a snail's crawl, the left-front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire, occasionally scraping against the road itself.</s>
<s snum=91>Lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel.</s>
<s snum=92>He seemed very pleased with himself, as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned.</s>
<s snum=93>Along with this self-satisfaction, however, Joyce sensed a growing tension.</s>
<s snum=94>It poured out of him like an electric current, a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action, and that that action would be all that he anticipated.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=95>Joyce had seen him like this once before- more than once, actually, but on one particularly memorable occasion.</s>
<s snum=96>That was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride, field boss for the Highlands Oil + Gas Company.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=97>Tom had been laying for Aaron McBride for a long time, just waiting to catch him out of line.</s>
<s snum=98>McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip.</s>
<s snum=99>He had a legitimate reason for wearing it.</s>
<s snum=100>It was payday for Highlands, and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields.</s>
<s snum=101>Moreover, as long as the weapon was carried openly, the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=102>``So what's this all about''? he demanded, when Lord confronted him.</s>
<s snum=103>I'm not the only man in town with a gun, or the only one without a permit``.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=104>It was the wrong thing to say.</s>
<s snum=105>By failing to do as he was told instantly- to take out a permit or return the gun to his car- he had played into Lord's hands.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=106>The trouble was that he had virtually had to protest.</s>
<s snum=107>The deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=108>So, ``How about it''? he said.</s>
<s snum=109>``Why single me out on this permit deal''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=110>``Well, I'll tell you about that'', Lord told him.</s>
<s snum=111>``We aim t' be see-lective, y'know?</s>
<s snum=112>Don't like to bother no one unless we have to, which I figger we do, in your case.</s>
<s snum=113>Figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands big shots''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=114>McBride reddened.</s>
<s snum=115>He himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company, but that had nothing to do with him.</s>
<s snum=116>He was an honest man doing a hard job, and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>``Look, Lord'', he said hoarsely.</s>
<s snum=118>``I know you've got a grudge against me, and maybe I can't blame you.</s>
<s snum=119>You think that Highlands swindled you and I helped 'em do it.</s>
<s snum=120>But you're all wrong, man!</s>
<s snum=121>I'm no lawyer.</s>
<s snum=122>I just do what I'm told, and''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=123>``Uh-huh.</s>
<s snum=124>An' that could mean trouble with a fella that's workin' for crooks.</s>
<s snum=125>So you get rid of that pistol right now, Mis-ter McBride.</s>
<s snum=126>You do that or take you out a permit right now''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=127>McBride couldn't do either, of course.</s>
<s snum=128>Not immediately, as the deputy demanded.</s>
<s snum=129>Not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes.</s>
<s snum=130>To do so would make his job well-nigh impossible.</s>
<s snum=131>Oil-field workers were a rough-tough lot.</s>
<s snum=132>How could he exert authority over them- make them toe the line, as he had to- if he knuckled under to this small-town clown?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=133>``I'll get around to it a little later'', he mumbled desperately.</s>
<s snum=134>``Just as soon as I go to the bank, and''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=135>``Huh-uh.</s>
<s snum=136>Now, Mis-ter McBride'', said Lord, and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss's arm.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=137>It was strictly the deputy's game, but McBride had gone too far to throw in.</s>
<s snum=138>Now, he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's coldest deck.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=139>He flung off Lord's hand and attempted to push past him, inadvertently shoving him into a storefront.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=140>It was practically the last move that McBride made of his own volition.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=141>Lord slugged him in the stomach, so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine.</s>
<s snum=142>Then, as he doubled, gasping, vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten, Lord straightened him with an uppercut.</s>
<s snum=143>A rabbit punch redoubled him.</s>
<s snum=144>And then there was a numbing blow to the heart, and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=145>But he couldn't keep up with them.</s>
<s snum=146>No more could he defend himself against them.</s>
<s snum=147>He seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen.</s>
<s snum=148>And he could no longer think of face-saving, of honor, but only of escape.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=149>Why, he's going to kill me, he thought wildly.</s>
<s snum=150>I meant him no harm.</s>
<s snum=151>I've given willful hurt to no man.</s>
<s snum=152>I was just doing my job, just following orders, and for that he's going to kill me.</s>
<s snum=153>Beat me to death in front of a hundred people.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=154>Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for it: the murder would go unpunished.</s>
<s snum=155>He, McBride, would be cited as in the wrong, and he, Lord, would go scot-free, an officer who had only done his duty, though perhaps too energetically.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=156>McBride staggered into the street, flopped sprawling in the stinging dust.</s>
<s snum=157>Fear-maddened, fleeing the lengthening shadow of death, he scrambled to his feet again.</s>
<s snum=158>He couldn't see; he was long past the point of coherent thinking.</s>
<s snum=159>Dimly, he heard laughter, hoots of derision, but he could not read the racket properly.</s>
<s snum=160>He could not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago, and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=161>He hated them too much to understand- the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that was Lord's world.</s>
<s snum=162>This, he was sure, was the way they would act; laughing at a dying man, laughing as a man was beaten to death.</s>
<s snum=163>And nothing would be done about it.</s>
<s snum=164>Nothing unless &&&.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=165>Donna!</s>
<s snum=166>Donna, his young wife, the girl who was both daughter and wife to him.</s>
<s snum=167>Donna was like he was.</s>
<s snum=168>She lived by the rules, never compromising, never blinded or diverted by circumstance.</s>
<s snum=169>And Donna would- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=170>When he regained consciousness he was in Lord's house, in the office of Doctor Lord, the deputy's deceased father.</s>
