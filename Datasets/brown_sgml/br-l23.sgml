<p>
<s snum=1>That's what the man had said.</s>
<s snum=2>Haney peered doubtfully at his drinking companion through bleary, tear-filled eyes.</s>
<s snum=3>He had no ready answer, as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing.</s>
<s snum=4>Was the man drunk or crazy or both?</s>
<s snum=5>But his new-found buddy had matched him drink for drink until he lost count, and the man's eyes were still clear.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=6>The guy is off his rocker, Haney thought to himself, and looked away from those eyes.</s>
<s snum=7>Eyes that were clear, but also bright with a strange intensity, a sort of cold fire burning behind them.</s>
<s snum=8>Why hadn't he noticed it before?</s>
<s snum=9>No, the man was not drunk.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=10>He wondered how he got tied up with this stranger.</s>
<s snum=11>But, of course, he remembered now.</s>
<s snum=12>It was blurred, after two hours of steady drinking, but the occasion of it came back to him.</s>
<s snum=13>The stranger, his head seemingly sunk in thought, started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=14>Brakes howled and a horn blared furiously, but the man would have been hit if Phil hadn't called out to him a second before.</s>
<s snum=15>His shout had been involuntary, something anybody might have done without thinking, on the spur of the moment.</s>
<s snum=16>As a matter of fact, he wouldn't have cared at all if the guy had been hit.</s>
<s snum=17>Actually, he regretted having opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=18>By then, the stranger was thanking Haney profusely and had one arm around his shoulders as if he were an old friend.</s>
<s snum=19>So the driver started to curse at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his safe-driving record.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=20>Then the man he saved turned and looked squarely into the truck driver's face, without saying a word.</s>
<s snum=21>Very suddenly, the driver stopped swearing at them, turned on his heel and went back to his truck.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=22>Haney hadn't given it much thought at the time.</s>
<s snum=23>Now he recalled it very clearly, and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off.</s>
<s snum=24>It must have been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=25>When the light went their way, they went on across the street.</s>
<s snum=26>And when the stranger found out that Phil was on the way to one of his favorite bars, he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=27>Phil usually went alone and kept to himself, sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges.</s>
<s snum=28>But he decided he wouldn't mind company in return for free drinks, even though he made good money at his job.</s>
<s snum=29>Phil was like that.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>Now he wondered if it was worth it, having a screwball for company.</s>
<s snum=31>He really didn't take the offer seriously, but he began to feel uneasy.</s>
<s snum=32>When he finally got the coughing under control, he realized that Pete (all he gave was his first name) was still waiting for an answer- he didn't even seem to wink as he continued to stare.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=33>Haney managed a weak laugh.</s>
<s snum=34>``Guess I can't think of anyone, Pete.</s>
<s snum=35>Thanks anyhow''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=36>A faint crease appeared between the man's eyebrows.</s>
<s snum=37>``I think you aren't taking me seriously, Phil.</s>
<s snum=38>I meant it.</s>
<s snum=39>And everybody has some kind of grudge.</s>
<s snum=40>I might have got hit by that truck if it wasn't for you.</s>
<s snum=41>I believe in returning favors.</s>
<s snum=42>I'll do anything for somebody I like.</s>
<s snum=43>It won't cost you a cent, Phil.</s>
<s snum=44>Go ahead and try me''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=45>Phil rubbed his forehead wearily.</s>
<s snum=46>He was beginning to feel woolly.</s>
<s snum=47>Maybe it would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit.</s>
<s snum=48>He really didn't expect anything to come of it, and there were a few people.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>``All right'', he conceded finally, ``if you must know, I don't get along with the landlord.</s>
<s snum=50>He keeps riding me because I like to listen to the radio and sing while I'm taking a bath.</s>
<s snum=51>He says the neighbors complain, but I don't believe it.</s>
<s snum=52>Why don't they tell me themselves if it bothers them''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>The man closed his eyes and nodded.</s>
<s snum=54>When he looked up again, he seeemd almost contented.</s>
<s snum=55>``Fine.</s>
<s snum=56>Give me your address.</s>
<s snum=57>It will take a little time.</s>
<s snum=58>I want to study your landlord's habits and movements first.</s>
<s snum=59>You see, I always make it look like an accident.</s>
<s snum=60>Maybe suicide, if it looks reasonable.</s>
<s snum=61>In that way there's no trouble for the customer''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=62>Haney's eyebrows flew up.</s>
<s snum=63>``Customer''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>Pete smiled modestly.</s>
<s snum=65>``It's my line of work'', he said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=66>Five minutes later, before Haney could make his break, the stranger stood up and nodded farewell.</s>
<s snum=67>Haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently, and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>Phil decided to stay a little longer, and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there, but for the other glass on the table.</s>
<s snum=69>Some time before midnight he returned to his apartment and hit the sack, putting the whole incident out of mind before he fell asleep.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=70>The next day, Sunday, the hangover reminded Haney where he had been the night before.</s>
<s snum=71>The hangover in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy, and he groaned.</s>
<s snum=72>He went for more aspirin later in the day, and passed the surly landlord on the way- he was still alive and scowling as usual, as if tenants were a burden in his life.</s>
<s snum=73>Phil shrugged and ignored him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=74>He went back to work Monday.</s>
<s snum=75>By Wednesday the landlord was still alive.</s>
<s snum=76>Of course.</s>
<s snum=77>On Thursday, Haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife Lolly, and wished the stranger could do something about her.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=78>Coming home from work, he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building.</s>
<s snum=79>Inside the lobby, people were standing around, talking excitedly.</s>
<s snum=80>His spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=81>The landlord had died.</s>
<s snum=82>Late that afternoon, it seemed, he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection.</s>
<s snum=83>He had apparently been alone.</s>
<s snum=84>Nobody witnessed the fall- just the sickening impact when his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=85>Haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor, as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks.</s>
<s snum=86>He muttered something about how terrible it was, and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator.</s>
<s snum=87>Once inside his apartment, he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply in a chair.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=88>After a while he began to feel better about it, especially when no one bothered to ask any questions.</s>
<s snum=89>But after all, why should they?</s>
<s snum=90>Still later, he finally convinced himself that it was an accident- just a coincidence.</s>
<s snum=91>The stranger really had nothing to do with it, of course.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=92>Haney went to bed, happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord.</s>
<s snum=93>After all, the man had no family, so no one suffered, and everybody was better off for it.</s>
<s snum=94>Really, he said to himself, nobody kills a man just as a favor!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=95>So you thought I didn't mean what I said.</s>
<s snum=96>The stranger's eyes were large and sad, as if Phil Haney had hurt his feelings.</s>
<s snum=97>It was like a recurrent, annoying dream, but now the dream was beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=98>However, Haney knew it was not a dream.</s>
<s snum=99>He might be very tight, but he knew where he was.</s>
<s snum=100>It was the same bar, and it was two weeks later- Saturday night, when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=101>He had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table, as far as possible from any talkative, friendly lushes.</s>
<s snum=102>He was enjoying the weekly ritual of washing down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened with water.</s>
<s snum=103>This favorite grievance was not the landlord.</s>
<s snum=104>He had already quite forgotten about him.</s>
<s snum=105>In fact, he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment.</s>
<s snum=106>His real grievance was Lolly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=107>Toward the end of his fourth hairy highball, while he was moodily making wet rings on the table-top with the bottom of the glass, he became aware that he was not alone.</s>
<s snum=108>He looked up with bloodshot eyes and beheld the stranger sitting across the table, smiling a secret smile at him, as if they were fellow conspirators.</s>
<s snum=109>He hadn't even noticed- what was his name?</s>
<s snum=110>Pete?</s>
<s snum=111>- he hadn't seen him sit down.</s>
<s snum=112>The man was uncanny, like a shadow, and made as much noise as a shadow.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=113>Haney felt like shrinking out of sight, but he was already trapped in the corner with the wiry, dark little man.</s>
<s snum=114>He began to wish that he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing.</s>
<s snum=115>Was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep for a bar-buddy?</s>
<s snum=116>He'd have to start going to some of the other places again.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>In a low voice, almost whispering, the man had asked Phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back.</s>
<s snum=118>He made the mistake of answering in an offhand way, and instantly realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=119>Pete frowned slightly, then became sad and moody.</s>
<s snum=120>Haney didn't want to encourage his company, but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow, to prevent possible trouble.</s>
<s snum=121>But there was no trouble.</s>
<s snum=122>The guy sulked over his drink, obviously upset by Haney's lack of appreciation.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=123>To break the uncomfortable silence, Haney began to talk.</s>
<s snum=124>In time, and two drinks later, he was complaining bitterly about his wife, He was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest in his listener- it showed in the alert face and the suddenly bright eyes.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=125>When he paused to moisten his throat, the stranger broke in.</s>
<s snum=126>``But why pay her bills?</s>
<s snum=127>If she runs around with other men, and if you hate her as you say, why not just divorce her''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=128>Haney scowled.</s>
<s snum=129>``That bitch would love a divorce'', he growled.</s>
<s snum=130>``Then she'd get half of everything I have.</s>
<s snum=131>Community property deal- you know.</s>
<s snum=132>I'd have to sell out my business to pay her off with her share.</s>
<s snum=133>She can drop dead''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=134>Pete nodded understandingly.</s>
<s snum=135>``Oh yes.</s>
<s snum=136>Now I see.</s>
<s snum=137>You must understand, I haven't been in this state too long.</s>
<s snum=138>I came out here to retire.</s>
<s snum=139>That's why I- why I do a free job now and then.</s>
<s snum=140>You should have told me about her before''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=141>Haney felt a twinge of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again.</s>
<s snum=142>Then a wild thought ran circles through his clouded brain.</s>
<s snum=143>Suppose- just suppose this guy was really what he said he was!</s>
<s snum=144>A retired professional killer.</s>
<s snum=145>If he was just a nut, no harm was done.</s>
<s snum=146>But if he was the real thing, he could do something about Lolly.</s>
<s snum=147>He felt very cunning, very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=148>``No offense intended'', he said gently.</s>
<s snum=149>``But it's just that- well, you know.</s>
<s snum=150>The cops didn't suspect a thing, and I thought it was a coincidence.</s>
<s snum=151>After all, I didn't know you, Pete.</s>
<s snum=152>It could have been an accident''.</s>
<s snum=153>He shrugged casually.</s>
<s snum=154>``But if you say you managed it''.</s>
<s snum=155>The stranger was hooked.</s>
<s snum=156>His eyes burned feverishly.</s>
<s snum=157>``Yes, yes'', he muttered impatiently.</s>
<s snum=158>``Of course it looked like an accident.</s>
<s snum=159>I always work it that way- and always at a time when the customer has an alibi.</s>
<s snum=160>Let me prove it, Phil.</s>
<s snum=161>I think I can manage one more favor for you''.</s>
<s snum=162>He waited eagerly.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=163>Haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass.</s>
