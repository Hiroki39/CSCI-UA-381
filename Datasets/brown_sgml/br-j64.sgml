<s snum=1>If one characteristic distinguishes Boris Godunov, it is the consistency with which every person on the stage- including the chorus- comes alive in the music.</s>
<s snum=2>Much of this lifelike quality results from Mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections.</s>
<s snum=3>In this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera; such composers as Monteverdi, Lully and Purcell, with the same goal in mind, had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages.</s>
<s snum=4>Through long experimentation in his songs, Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different from others as the language itself.</s>
<s snum=5>Giving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra, he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence, but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=6>The moments of sung melody, in the usual sense, come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing, as in folk songs and liturgical chants.</s>
<s snum=7>Otherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion- Boris' first monologue, for example.</s>
<s snum=8>Even then, the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=9>Aside from Boris himself, one need but examine the secondary roles to place Mussorgsky among the masters of musical portraiture.</s>
<s snum=10>Even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full personalities, defined with economical precision.</s>
<s snum=11>Consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action: Pimen, Varlaam, Missail and the Jesuit Rangoni.</s>
<s snum=12>Under no circumstances could we mistake one for the other; each musical setting has an individual touch.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=13>Pimen is an old man, weak in body- his voice rarely rises to a full forte- but firm and clear of mind.</s>
<s snum=14>His calmness offers contrast to Grigori's youthful excitement.</s>
<s snum=15>A quiet but sturdy theme, somewhat folklike in character, appears whenever the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past life:</s>
<s snum=16>@ </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=17>This theme comes to represent the outer world, the realm of battles and banquets- seen from a distance, quite distinct from the quieter spiritual life in the monastery.</s>
<s snum=18>It changes and develops according to the text; it introduces Pimen when he comes before Boris in the last act.</s>
<s snum=19>Once he has been identified, however, a new melody is used to accompany his narrative, a bleak motif with barren octaves creating a rather ancient effect: @ </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=20>An imaginative storyteller, Pimen takes on the character he describes, as if he were experiencing the old shepherd's blindness and miraculous cure.</s>
<s snum=21>Here the composer uses a favorite device of his, the intensification of the mood through key relationships.</s>
<s snum=22>The original ~D minor seems to symbolize blindness, inescapable in spite of all attempts to move away from it.</s>
<s snum=23>As the child addresses the shepherd in a dream, light- in the form of the major mode- begins to appear, and at the moment of the miracle we hear a clear and shining ~D major.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=24>Varlaam and Missail always appear together and often sing together, in a straightforward, rhythmically vigorous idiom that distinguishes them from the more subtle and well-educated Pimen.</s>
<s snum=25>Their begging song might easily be a folk melody: @ </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=26>The same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene.</s>
<s snum=27>Apparently their origin is humble, their approach to life direct and unsophisticated.</s>
<s snum=28>Whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't disturb them now.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=29>Missail is the straight man, not very talkative, mild-mannered when he does speak.</s>
<s snum=30>Varlaam is loud, rowdy, uninhibited in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same.</s>
<s snum=31>A rough ostinato figure, heard first in the introduction to the inn scene, characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into the action: @ </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=32>The Song of Kazan, in which this figure becomes a wild-sounding accompaniment, fills in the picture of undisciplined high spirits.</s>
<s snum=33>The phrasing is irregular, and the abrupt key changes have a primitive forcefulness.</s>
<s snum=34>(We can imagine how they startled audiences of the 1870's.)</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>Varlaam's music begins to ramble as he feels the effects of the wine, but he pulls himself together when the need arises.</s>
<s snum=36>Both monks respond to the guard's challenge with a few phrases of their begging song; a clever naturalistic touch is Varlaam's labored reading of the warrant.</s>
<s snum=37>As the knack gradually comes back to him, his rhythm becomes steadier, with the rigid monotony of an unskilled reader.</s>
<s snum=38>For the only time in the opera, words are not set according to their natural inflection; to do so would have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=39>Musically and dramatically, Rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as Varlaam.</s>
<s snum=40>His music shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality that suggest somehow a blood-kinship with Dappertutto in Offenbach's Hoffman.</s>
<s snum=41>His speech shows none of the native accent of the Russian characters; in spite of the Italian name, he sounds French.</s>
<s snum=42>His personality appears more striking by contrast with Marina, who is- perhaps purposely- rather superficially characterized.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=43>Rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock, a sudden open fifth in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it.</s>
<s snum=44>The effect is as if he had materialized out of nowhere.</s>
<s snum=45>He speaks quietly, concealing his authority beneath a smooth humility, just as the shifting harmonies that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them.</s>
<s snum=46>He addresses Marina with great deference, calling her ``Princess'' at first; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses her given name, placing himself by implication in the position of a solicitous father.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=47>Curiously, this scene is a close parallel to one that Verdi was writing at the same time, the scene between Amonasro and Aida.</s>
<s snum=48>Rangoni and Amonasro have the same purpose- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her country's cause- and their tactics are much the same.</s>
<s snum=49>Rangoni begins by describing the sad state of the Church; this brings a reaction of distress from Marina.</s>
<s snum=50>The music becomes ethereal as he calls up a vision of her own sainthood: it is she, he tells her, who can bring the truth to Russia and convert the heretics.</s>
<s snum=51>As if in a trance, she repeats his words- then realizes, with a shock, her own audacity.</s>
<s snum=52>This is no assignment for a frivolous girl, she assures him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>Now Rangoni comes to the point, and we hear, for the first time, a long, downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic motif of his sinister power.</s>
<s snum=54>It is a phrase as arresting as a magician's gesture, with a piquant turn of harmony giving an effect of strangeness.</s>
<s snum=55>Another theme, sinuously chromatic, appears as he directs her to gain power over Grigori by any means, even at the cost of her honor.</s>
<s snum=56>Coming from a priest, the music sounds as odd as the advice:</s>
<s snum=57>@ </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=58>Marina rebels at this suggestion.</s>
<s snum=59>Her pride is as much at stake as her virtue; she is the unattainable beauty, the princess who turns away suitors by the dozen.</s>
<s snum=60>Indignantly she denounces Rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=61>At once the Jesuit pulls out all the stops.</s>
<s snum=62>To music of a menacing darkness, he describes the powers of Satan gaining control of the girl, poisoning her soul with pride and destroying her beauty.</s>
<s snum=63>The combined threat of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her, and she falls terrified at his feet.</s>
<s snum=64>With another sudden change of mood, he is again calm and protective, exhorting her to trust and obey him as God's spokesman- and the chromatic scale descends in ominous contradiction.</s>
<s snum=65>Whatever the source of Rangoni's power, Marina is his captive now; we are reminded of this at the end of the next scene, when his theme cuts through the warmth of the love duet, again throwing a chill over the atmosphere.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=66>The most unusual feature of Boris, however, is the use of the greatest character of all, the chorus.</s>
<s snum=67>This is the real protagonist of the drama; the conflict is not Boris versus Grigori or Shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child, but Boris versus the Russian people.</s>
<s snum=68>Mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the extent to which choral scenes propel the action.</s>
<s snum=69>Boris' first entrance seems almost a footnote to the splendor of the Coronation Scene, with its dazzling confusion of tonalities.</s>
<s snum=70>We have a brief glimpse of the Tsar's public personality, the ``official Boris'', but our real focus is on the excitement of the crowd- a signigicant contrast with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene, its bitter resentment and fury in the final act.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>One reason for the unique vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression.</s>
<s snum=72>It rarely speaks as a unit.</s>
<s snum=73>Even in its most conventional appearance, the guests' song of praise to Marina, there are a few female dissenters criticizing the princess for her coldness.</s>
<s snum=74>In many passages- for example, the council of boyars- each section of the chorus becomes a character group with a particular opinion.</s>
<s snum=75>Hot arguments arise between tenors and basses, who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an idea.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>The opening scene shows this method at its most individual.</s>
<s snum=77>Mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people, those who must suffer the effects of their rulers' struggle for power without understanding the causes.</s>
<s snum=78>They are held in control by force, but barely.</s>
<s snum=79>They will kneel and plead for Boris' leadership in a strangely intense song, its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath, but when the police with their cudgels move away, they mock and grumble and fight among themselves.</s>
<s snum=80>There is a quick change from the plaintive song to a conversational tone.</s>
<s snum=81>``Hey, Mityukh'', asks one group, ``what are we shouting about''?</s>
<s snum=82>And Mityukh, apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd, replies that he has no notion.</s>
<s snum=83>The jokes and arguments grow louder until the police return; then the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before, ending it with a wail of despair.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=84>Mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical music with considerable dramatic force.</s>
<s snum=85>In Pimen's cell the soft prayers of the monks, heard from offstage, not only help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between young Grigori's thoughts and his situation.</s>
<s snum=86>This is especially striking between Pimen's quiet exit and Grigori's vehement outburst against Boris.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=87>Again, as Boris feels himself nearing death, a procession files into the hall singing a hymn, its modal harmonies adding a churchly touch to the grim atmosphere: @ The words are hardly calculated to put the Tsar's mind at ease.</s>
<s snum=88>They echo the words with which he has described his own vision of the dying child who ``trembles and begs for mercy- and there is no mercy''.</s>
<s snum=89>The living as well as the dead now accuse him; this final reminder of his guilt is the fatal one.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=90>One of the outstanding assets of the present production is the restoration of the St. Basil's scene, usually omitted from performances and rarely included in a published score.</s>
<s snum=91>Though brief, it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy.</s>
<s snum=92>In addition, it is an important link in the plot, giving us a revealing glimpse of the people's attitude toward Boris and the false Dimitri.</s>
<s snum=93>The mayhem in the forest of Kromy is a natural sequel.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=94>The St. Basil's scene opens with little groups of beggars milling around the square, the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny.</s>
<s snum=95>In the orchestra we hear first a hushed, hesitant pizzicato figure, then the insistent ``police'' motif as it appeared in the opening scene.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=96>The service is over, and a number of people come from the church with their spokesman Mityukh in the lead.</s>
<s snum=97>They bring the news that the Pretender has been excommunicated; this is met with scorn by the hearers, who claim that Mityukh is lying or drunk.</s>
<s snum=98>(Mussorgsky cleverly contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment, solemn chords or mocking staccatos.)</s>
<s snum=99>There is still more news, Mityukh announces: they have prayed for the soul of the Tsarevich.</s>
