<s snum=1>She called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night.</s>
<s snum=2>``Shirley appreciated the chance to make some money.</s>
<s snum=3>Such a nice little thing- lives right in the building''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=4>``That's swell'', I said sweetly.</s>
<s snum=5>I could get along without that three dollars.</s>
<s snum=6>In some ways it was worth being out the money- just knowing I was no longer obligated to Nadine!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>It was past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang.</s>
<s snum=8>I stumbled through the hall, wondering who would be calling at this hour.</s>
<s snum=9>I answered to find Nadine at the other end.</s>
<s snum=10>``You scared me half to death'', I said shakily.</s>
<s snum=11>``What's wrong''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=12>``Janice, nobody answers at the apartment''!</s>
<s snum=13>Her voice came shrill.</s>
<s snum=14>``I'm absolutely frantic!</s>
<s snum=15>That stupid girl might have gone off and left Francie''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=16>``Oh, she wouldn't do that'', I said.</s>
<s snum=17>``She's probably fallen asleep and doesn't hear the phone.</s>
<s snum=18>But if you're worried you can go home and check''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=19>``I can't leave the party!</s>
<s snum=20>We're at Ken Thom's apartment, and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat!</s>
<s snum=21>Old Mr. Thom is already down on Wally, and we simply can't afford to get Ken mad at us''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=22>I was all set for what came next.</s>
<s snum=23>``Janice, could you possibly go over and make sure everything's all right?</s>
<s snum=24>I'll call you there in ten minutes''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=25>``I can't make it in ten minutes''- Wondering, as I said it, why I should make it at all.</s>
<s snum=26>Why should I go over at midnight to check on Francie, when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=27>``Fifteen minutes, then!</s>
<s snum=28>Please, Janice.</s>
<s snum=29>I'll be glad to pay you''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=30>So sure that money could do anything!</s>
<s snum=31>``All right'', I said.</s>
<s snum=32>I'd do it.</s>
<s snum=33>Not for the dollar or so Nadine would give me.</s>
<s snum=34>But because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment, and if I didn't go over, who would?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>Chris was sound asleep, and I didn't see any sense in waking him.</s>
<s snum=36>I dressed in the kitchen, then left a note on the table telling him what had happened.</s>
<s snum=37>I drove off through the cool darkness to Nadine's apartment and rang the bell, and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door.</s>
<s snum=38>Her face was flushed from sleep.</s>
<s snum=39>``It's all right'', I said, as she started to look scared.</s>
<s snum=40>``Mrs. Roberts had called, and couldn't wake you.</s>
<s snum=41>I just came over to make sure everything was all right''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=42>``I'm- hard to wake up'', she faltered.</s>
<s snum=43>She didn't look over thirteen.</s>
<s snum=44>And Nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable!</s>
<s snum=45>``I have to get up early for church tomorrow'', she went on.</s>
<s snum=46>``I didn't know it was going to be this late''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=47>The phone started ringing.</s>
<s snum=48>``That's Mrs. Roberts again'', I said.</s>
<s snum=49>``I'll answer it''.</s>
<s snum=50>I crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone.</s>
<s snum=51>I told Nadine everything was fine, and that I'd be getting on home.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=52>``Janice, would you mind staying''?</s>
<s snum=53>There was a ragged edge to her voice now, as if she'd been crying.</s>
<s snum=54>``Wally's drunk- I'll get him out of here as soon as I possibly can, but I don't want Shirley to see him like this.</s>
<s snum=55>You know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=56>Not a word of thanks for what I'd already done.</s>
<s snum=57>The receiver clicked in my ear.</s>
<s snum=58>She didn't even give me a chance to refuse.</s>
<s snum=59>Well, there wasn't any law that said I had to stay!</s>
<s snum=60>But then I looked at Shirley and thought that I might as well- the child needed her sleep, and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be, with Wally coming home drunk.</s>
<s snum=61>So I told her Mrs.Roberts would pay her in the morning, and she scooted off to her own apartment.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=62>After I looked in at Francie, I went into the living room and waited.</s>
<s snum=63>I must have dozed off, because I came to with a start at the sound of voices.</s>
<s snum=64>Nadine's, shrill with anger- Wally's loud and thick- As I went to the door I heard the clock strike two.</s>
<s snum=65>I opened the door, and Wally stumbled in- fast- as if Nadine had pushed him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=66>I had always thought she was so beautiful.</s>
<s snum=67>But now she looked ugly.</s>
<s snum=68>Her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out, and if looks could kill, Wally would have been dead.</s>
<s snum=69>``Pack your clothes'', she hissed.</s>
<s snum=70>``Pack- and get out''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>``You're crazy'', Wally said thickly.</s>
<s snum=72>He lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it, and was instantly asleep.</s>
<s snum=73>Nadine strode over to him, and her pointed nails raked across his face.</s>
<s snum=74>I grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second I thought that maybe Wally was right, and she was crazy.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=75>``You stay out of this'', she spat at me.</s>
<s snum=76>``He's ruined us- do you hear me- he's ruined us!</s>
<s snum=77>He insulted Ken Thom''!</s>
<s snum=78>Her eyes were wild.</s>
<s snum=79>``He told Ken to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman!</s>
<s snum=80>And the other people there were listening!</s>
<s snum=81>We're ruined and he's going to get out if I have to throw him down the stairs''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>``You'd better simmer down'', I said nervously.</s>
<s snum=83>I was plenty scared.</s>
<s snum=84>In the state she was in, she could actually kill him!</s>
<s snum=85>``Now you just take it easy, and I'll make you some tea''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=86>``Tea,'' Nadine screeched.</s>
<s snum=87>``How can you be so damn stupid?</s>
<s snum=88>Wally's lost his job!</s>
<s snum=89>Ken will never forgive him- never!</s>
<s snum=90>And we don't have any money- we don't have a dime!</s>
<s snum=91>All we own is Francie's bedroom set and the televison-record player and we even owe on them.</s>
<s snum=92>And we'll be poor and have to live in a grubby little house like yours- and all because of that''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=93>I clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth.</s>
<s snum=94>``Stop that!</s>
<s snum=95>You'll wake up the whole building.</s>
<s snum=96>Wally can't go any place at this hour''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=97>``Well then, I'll get out''- But she looked uncertain.</s>
<s snum=98>She was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=99>``You go to bed'', I said curtly.</s>
<s snum=100>``In the morning you and Wally can talk things out''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=101>She collapsed against me, as if everything inside her snapped.</s>
<s snum=102>I got her into bed, and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out.</s>
<s snum=103>It was three o'clock before I figured it was all right to go.</s>
<s snum=104>I left her, a limp bundle of self-pity, shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her.</s>
<s snum=105>Wally was snoring on the davenport.</s>
<s snum=106>I had done all I could.</s>
<s snum=107>I had done all I was going to do.</s>
<s snum=108>Whether or not Wally lost his job was no concern of mine.</s>
<s snum=109>I drove home, found Chris still asleep.</s>
<s snum=110>I snuggled up close to him- loving him- thankful for a man like him.</s>
<s snum=111>Thankful I wasn't Nadine.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=112>I kept on being thankful.</s>
<s snum=113>In the afternoon Nadine and Wally came over with Francie.</s>
<s snum=114>Wally sat in our big chair, his hands between his knees, looking ready to cry.</s>
<s snum=115>``I'd had all this trouble with the old man, that's why I drank so much.</s>
<s snum=116>I- got fired yesterday for not attending to business''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>Old Mr. Thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job, Wally confessed, and couldn't get one because there were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired.</s>
<s snum=118>Seems that the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side.</s>
<s snum=119>Mr. Thom had gotten Wally on the phone, and fired him.</s>
<s snum=120>``I thought I'd smooth things over through Ken'', Wally said miserably.</s>
<s snum=121>``But Ken got coy and wouldn't make any promises.</s>
<s snum=122>And I was plastered and I blew my stack''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=123>``And told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman''!</s>
<s snum=124>I tried to quiet Nadine because the children were there.</s>
<s snum=125>But she was beyond caring what she said.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=126>``Things may smooth over yet'', Chris said, his nice lean face grave with honest concern.</s>
<s snum=127>But I couldn't help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved.</s>
<s snum=128>Now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=129>When a bubble breaks, there's nothing.</s>
<s snum=130>Little by little, during the week, Chris and I discovered the crazy unbelievable way Nadine and Wally had lived.</s>
<s snum=131>They had not only spent every cent- they were in debt up to their necks, owing on everything they owned.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=132>On top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent, and the day Wally received written notice that he was fired, they were evicted.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=133>Worst of all, Wally had no training for any kind of work.</s>
<s snum=134>He had fallen into a soft job, and now the job was gone and he was stranded.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=135>Chris fretted.</s>
<s snum=136>``I wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=137>I said I wished we were, too.</s>
<s snum=138>It was easy enough to say it, because of course we couldn't spare a cent.</s>
<s snum=139>But Chris brightened up like a candle.</s>
<s snum=140>``I'm glad you feel that way, honey.</s>
<s snum=141>There is one big way we can help them.</s>
<s snum=142>We can let them move in with us''- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=143>Something I had simply never thought of.</s>
<s snum=144>Something so incredible- </s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=145>I just stared at him.</s>
<s snum=146>It was incredible- He gave me an embarrassed, pleading look.</s>
<s snum=147>``I know we'd be pretty crowded.</s>
<s snum=148>But it would only be for a couple of weeks- until they get straightened out''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=149>Straightened out- They'd had years of making all that money!</s>
<s snum=150>``I won't do it'', I said flatly.</s>
<s snum=151>``Nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this!</s>
<s snum=152>Well, now she can sleep in the street for all I care''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=153>``That isn't like you, Janice'', Chris said uncomfortably.</s>
<s snum=154>Then I felt uncomfortable, too.</s>
<s snum=155>I didn't want to be like that, mean and bitter.</s>
<s snum=156>But, darn it all, why should we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down their noses at us?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=157>But, in the end, we did.</s>
<s snum=158>It just seemed as if there was nothing else to do.</s>
<s snum=159>The finance company took all their furniture- and they didn't have a cent to their name.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=160>Then Wally got sick.</s>
<s snum=161>To my way of thinking, he was scared sick.</s>
<s snum=162>His luck had failed him, and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=163>Chris made trip after trip in our old car, moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of groceries Nadine had bought on special.</s>
<s snum=164>At least we'll eat, I thought grimly as I put all the food away.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=165>While I worked, Nadine sat and cried.</s>
<s snum=166>When she wasn't crying, she was in our bedroom fighting with Wally.</s>
<s snum=167>``Virus infection nothing'', she'd scream at him.</s>
<s snum=168>``You're too lazy to go out and look for another job.</s>
<s snum=169>You're just a no-good bum''!</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=170>It was a mess, all right.</s>
<s snum=171>But it couldn't go on forever- A couple of weeks, Chris had said.</s>
<s snum=172>I figured I could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=173>But the two weeks dragged into three, and they were still with us.</s>
<s snum=174>Nadine's constant nagging had finally gotten Wally out of bed.</s>
<s snum=175>He set out every morning looking for work, and come home around noon, full of alibis and excuses.</s>
<s snum=176>Wendell Thom had black-balled him.</s>
<s snum=177>Nobody would even take his application.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=178>``You can get something,'' Nadine would snap.</s>
<s snum=179>``You can get a job working in a grocery store, if nothing else''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=180>``The high school kids have got everything sewed up'', he said, a whine in his voice.</s>
<s snum=181>``Those damn punks- taking work away from men who need it''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=182>``By fall they'll be back in school'', I'd say, trying to sound encouraging.</s>
<s snum=183>But this was only the middle of July.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=184>And I couldn't take six more weeks of this.</s>
<s snum=185>I mentioned it to Chris one stifling hot night, when I had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air.</s>
