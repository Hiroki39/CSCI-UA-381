<s snum=1>Under normal circumstances, he had a certain bright-eyed all-American-boy charm, with great appeal for young ladies, old ladies, and dogs.</s>
<s snum=2>Today, he looked like an Astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on the bureau and spent six months in space: hollow eyes, hollow cheeks, hollow stomach.</s>
<s snum=3>Breakfast, he thought.</s>
<s snum=4>A shot of orange juice would make everything seem better.</s>
<s snum=5>He looked around his little Eden: bureau, bed, table, chair, two-burner stove.</s>
<s snum=6>Then he remembered.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=7>``You share a refrigerator'', Mrs. Kirby had said, and somehow, at midnight, after the long drive from New York in pelting rain, that had sounded reasonable.</s>
<s snum=8>In the cold light of day, it seemed a lunatic arrangement.</s>
<s snum=9>Share bath, maybe- but share refrigerator?</s>
<s snum=10>She had explained it- something about summer people's eating out and not enough space in the units.</s>
<s snum=11>And where was the thing?</s>
<s snum=12>He remembered seeing it last night, when he put away his small store of bachelor-type eatables.</s>
<s snum=13>Ah, yes- his half of a refrigerator stood outside, on the ``curving veranda'' between Unit Number Three and Unit Number Four.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=14>It was still raining, and Mrs. Kirby's cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore, vivid blue and green and magenta.</s>
<s snum=15>Charlie downed his orange juice and one of the long, skinny green pills, his spirits as damp as the day.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=16>This vacation had seemed like a good idea last week, when his doctor had prescribed it.</s>
<s snum=17>``Take a full month'', the doctor had said.</s>
<s snum=18>``Lots of sun, lots of rest.</s>
<s snum=19>The red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound.</s>
<s snum=20>This is a sleeping capsule.</s>
<s snum=21>The others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked.</s>
<s snum=22>You young men get to be my age, you won't take flu so lightly''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=23>Charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment.</s>
<s snum=24>The doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi; but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew, too, that there was no pill to cure it.</s>
<s snum=25>He had loved and lost Vivian Wayne to somebody else, had watched her marry the somebody else, and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever, which was really piling it on.</s>
<s snum=26>He had caught, too, like an ailment, a confirmed distrust of women.</s>
<s snum=27>Once burned- scalded, really, because Vivian had given him every encouragement- forever shy.</s>
<s snum=28>From now on, his was going to be a man's world: the North Woods, duck blinds at dawning, beer and poker and male secretaries.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=29>Meanwhile, he had this miserable cold, and as he leaned against the refrigerator, watching the rain make sandy puddles at his feet, the doctor's prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery.</s>
<s snum=30>In these damp circumstances, he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=31>He looked up to see Mrs. Kirby, awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted slicker, bearing down on him.</s>
<s snum=32>``Three-day blow''! she bellowed triumphantly.</s>
<s snum=33>He had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of Pyhrric victory over the tourists.</s>
<s snum=34>``Fine, day after tomorrow'', she added.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=35>``I hope so'', he said.</s>
<s snum=36>``I've got this cold.</s>
<s snum=37>Thought I'd bake it out in the sun''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=38>``Ah''.</s>
<s snum=39>She studied him briefly.</s>
<s snum=40>``You've got a peaked look.</s>
<s snum=41>Better get in out of the wet''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=42>Charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal, Peony being less than weatherproof.</s>
<s snum=43>As for its being fine, day after tomorrow, he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again, with Vivian lost to him forever.</s>
<s snum=44>He could imagine her at this minute, honeymooning in Nassau with what's-his-name, lounging on golden sands, looking forward to a life of unalloyed bliss.</s>
<s snum=45>All Charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon, a salami sandwich for lunch, and a lonely old age- if he lived that long.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=46>He leafed through the light reading provided by Mrs. Kirby for her guests: four separate adventures of the Bobbsey Twins (At the Seashore, At the Mountains, On the Farm, and In Danger) and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle, hideously illustrated.</s>
<s snum=47>He dozed, only to dream of Vivian, and woke, only to crash into the night table, bruising his other shin.</s>
<s snum=48>He took a yellow pill, only to choke on it, and went for the salami, only to find something alive in the refrigerator- something pink and fuzzy.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=49>His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby, in her mania for color, had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in; but on further investigation, the thing proved to be a sweater, of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men's jackets- pale, pale pink and, according to the label, size thirty-four.</s>
<s snum=50>He thought about it for a minute, could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator, got the salami, bread, and a Bermuda onion, and put the whole thing out of his mind.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=51>Next morning, he found a note in the refrigerator.</s>
<s snum=52>``Would you mind wrapping your onion''? said this note.</s>
<s snum=53>``The smell permeates everything''!</s>
<s snum=54>Everything being the sweater, a lipstick case, and a squirt bottle of Kissin' Kare pink hand lotion.</s>
<s snum=55>The note paper was pink, too, and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine.</s>
<s snum=56>Not that he had supposed, considering the evidence, that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach Patrol.</s>
<s snum=57>He scrawled ``Sorry'' across the bottom of the note and then, against his better judgment, added: ``Don't you eat''?</s>
<s snum=58>He didn't want to encourage anything here; but on the other hand, he didn't want her swiping his salami.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=59>``Not onions'', came the answer the following day.</s>
<s snum=60>``Ugh''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=61>Must have really smelled up her sweater, he thought, and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen.</s>
<s snum=62>But then, as he well knew, women are not guided by logic or common sense.</s>
<s snum=63>Take Vivian.</s>
<s snum=64>Yes, take Vivian.</s>
<s snum=65>Somebody had.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=66>Now, if this were Vivian next door to him and if, for some obscure female reason, she kept her clothes in the refrigerator, they would not be pink.</s>
<s snum=67>They would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid, chic and splashy, like Vivian herself.</s>
<s snum=68>Pink, Vivian once had told him, was for baby girls, and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=69>``Why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator''?</s>
<s snum=70>he mused aloud.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=71>Eh``?</s>
<s snum=72>It was Mrs. Kirby, making her toilsome way along the veranda, laden with a clattery collection of mops, brushes, and pails.</s>
<s snum=73>''What's that you say``?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=74>``Oh, nothing.</s>
<s snum=75>Just glad the rain's stopped''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>``Oh, yes.</s>
<s snum=77>Just look at that sky.</s>
<s snum=78>Be a scorcher by afternoon''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=79>``I hope so.</s>
<s snum=80>I've got this cold''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=81>``So you said''.</s>
<s snum=82>She scrutinized him.</s>
<s snum=83>``My, you're peaked.</s>
<s snum=84>You want to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash, first sunny day.</s>
<s snum=85>I must remember to warn the girl next to you in Larkspur.</s>
<s snum=86>That pale kind's the worst''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=87>That pale kind, Charlie thought.</s>
<s snum=88>Hardly an inviting description.</s>
<s snum=89>But then, neither was peaked.</s>
<s snum=90>He could hear Mrs. Kirby now, warning her pale guest against sunburn.</s>
<s snum=91>``I spoke to the fellow next door, too'', she might say.</s>
<s snum=92>``He's that peaked kind''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=93>Surely there was a better word.</s>
<s snum=94>Charlie looked in the mirror.</s>
<s snum=95>Run-down, iron-poor.</s>
<s snum=96>He looked more closely.</s>
<s snum=97>Frail, feeble- peaked.</s>
<s snum=98>Clearly, two damp days with the Bobbsey Twins had done him no good.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=99>The sun, blazing hot as prophesied, was far from kind to Mrs. Kirby's varicolored properties.</s>
<s snum=100>When Charlie came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill, the whole establishment (gaudy enough when seen through mist and fog) looked like a floodlit modern painting- great blocks of dizzy color, punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators.</s>
<s snum=101>This weekend, he thought, he would look around for some more subdued retreat, with Cape roses, maybe, at the door.</s>
<s snum=102>He could not imagine a flower's being brave enough to grow beside Peony, Larkspur, and the rest.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=103>The sweater was gone from the refrigerator, and in its place was a large plastic bag, full of wet pink clothes.</s>
<s snum=104>No wonder she was so pale, wearing all those cold clothes.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=105>He got a red pill and a beer and then, on impulse, transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled ``Be my guest'' on the wrapping.</s>
<s snum=106>It gave him a good feeling.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=107>``M-m-m.</s>
<s snum=108>Thanks'', was her answer the next day.</s>
<s snum=109>The note was propped against his pill bottles and bore a postscript: ``You're not at all well, are you''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=110>``I've got this cold'', he wrote.</s>
<s snum=111>Not that it was any of her business.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=112>``It's none of my business'', said the next note, ``but my aunt Elsie used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold, and she lived to be ninety-six.</s>
<s snum=113>I mean, she's still living, and she's ninety-six.</s>
<s snum=114>Why don't you try that''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=115>``I don't have a lemon''.</s>
<s snum=116>He had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=117>By the next morning, she had turned the paper over.</s>
<s snum=118>``Gee, neither do I''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=119>Charlie grinned.</s>
<s snum=120>She didn't sound like a pale girl.</s>
<s snum=121>She sounded a little like a redhead.</s>
<s snum=122>But then, redheads are often pale.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=123>He stuck his head in Mrs. Kirby's little rental office.</s>
<s snum=124>``I guess that redhead next to me took your advice.</s>
<s snum=125>I haven't seen her on the beach''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=126>``You won't, if you're looking for a redhead.</s>
<s snum=127>She's got browny hair''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=128>He spent that afternoon on the beach, looking for a pale, browny-haired girl in a pink bathing suit.</s>
<s snum=129>There were pink bathing suits on blondes, and browny-haired girls in red or black or green bathing suits.</s>
<s snum=130>There were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits.</s>
<s snum=131>Up on a dune, he saw a girl, all by herself, sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting.</s>
<s snum=132>He paid little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white- one of those bulky, turtle-neck sweaters.</s>
<s snum=133>On the beach, there were pale girls and not-so-pale girls.</s>
<s snum=134>And he saw them all as he walked up and down.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=135>At two that morning, he was still walking- up and down Peony, up and down the veranda, up and down the silent, moonlit beach.</s>
<s snum=136>Finally, in desperation, he opened the refrigerator, filched her hand lotion, and left a note.</s>
<s snum=137>``I've got this sunburn'', said the note, ``and I used some of your hand lotion.</s>
<s snum=138>Hope you don't mind''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=139>``Of course I don't mind'', she answered.</s>
<s snum=140>``You're having a miserable time, aren't you?</s>
<s snum=141>Use all the lotion you want, and for goodness' sake, stay in out of the sun for a couple of days''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=142>This was a very warm, sympathetic girl, he decided.</s>
<s snum=143>Sympathy is a fine quality in a woman.</s>
<s snum=144>Now Vivian, for instance, was not too long on sympathy.</s>
<s snum=145>She felt, and said, that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves; it was a tough world, and you had to be tough to hold your own.</s>
<s snum=146>He didn't know what was so tough about Vivian's world, slopping around Nassau with what's-his-name.</s>
<s snum=147>Suppose what's-his-name got a sunburn?</s>
<s snum=148>Charlie couldn't see Vivian offering any hand lotion.</s>
<s snum=149>She might peel him, once the worst of the agony was over.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=150>Charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms, waiting for the fire in his back to subside, and used generous quantities of the hand lotion.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=151>Correspondence passed back and forth.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=152>``How's your sunburn now?</s>
<s snum=153>The only thing, this lotion has glycerin in it, and that whitens the skin, so if you're so anxious to get a tan, you may not want to use it''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=154>``I'm not that anxious, but maybe that's why you're so fair''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=155>``That Mrs. Kirby!</s>
<s snum=156>I'll bet she told you I was puny, too.</s>
<s snum=157>How's your cold''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=158>``Broiled out.</s>
<s snum=159>She didn't say you were puny.</s>
<s snum=160>Are you?</s>
<s snum=161>What's puny''?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=162>``Puny goes with pale and peaked.</s>
<s snum=163>Do you have anything to read while you're shut up?</s>
<s snum=164>There are two things here about Surviving in the Wilderness, and a book called 'Tom Swift and His Speedy Canoe'; but the picture of Tom Swift is pretty sinister.</s>
<s snum=165>Also the canoe''.</s>
