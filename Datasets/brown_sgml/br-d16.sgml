<s snum=1>Pope Leo 13,, on the 13th day of December 1898, granted the following indulgences: ``An indulgence of three hundred days is granted to all the Faithful who read the Holy Gospels at least a quarter of an hour.</s>
<s snum=2>A Plenary Indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading''.</s>
<s snum=3>Pope Pius the Sixth, at Rome, in april, 1778, wrote the following:</s>
<s snum=4>``The faithful should be excited to the reading of the Holy Scriptures: For these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone, to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine, to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times''.</s>
<s snum=5>The American Bishops assembled at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore urged the Catholic people to read the Holy Bible.</s>
<s snum=6>``We hope'', they said, ``that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the Holy Scriptures''.</s>
<s snum=7>They recommended, also, that ``at a fixed hour, let the entire family be assembled for night prayers, followed by a short reading of the Holy Scriptures''.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=8>Since the Catholic Church expresses such desire that the Sacred Scriptures be read, the following taken from the Holy Bible (New Catholic Edition) will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing.</s>

</p>
<hl>THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE NATURAL MAN IS SPIRITUALLY DEAD AND BLIND.</hl>

<s snum=94>St.John 1:12, 13.</s>
</p>
<hl>A FINAL WORD</hl>
<p>
<s snum=95>You may be very religious, a good church member, an upright, honest and sincere person; you may be baptized, confirmed, reverent and worshipful; you may attend mass, do penance, say prayers and zealously keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church; you may have the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal punishment.</s>
<s snum=96>You cannot be saved; you cannot go to heaven unless you are born again.</s>
<s snum=97>Our blessed Lord Jesus Christ, the sinless Son of God, who could not lie, said, ``Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God'' (St. John 3:3).</s>
<s snum=98>``You must be born again'' (St. John 3:7).</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=99>Being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting Christ as Saviour, and being convicted by the Holy Spirit of my lost condition, I do repent of all effort to be saved by any form of good works, and just now receive Jesus as my personal Saviour and salvation as a free gift from Him.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=100>You may do as you please with God now.</s>
<s snum=101>It is permitted.</s>
<s snum=102>God placed Himself in men's hands when He sent Jesus Christ into the world as perfect God and perfect Man in one Being.</s>
<s snum=103>He was then in man's hands.</s>
<s snum=104>They cursed Him.</s>
<s snum=105>It was permitted.</s>
<s snum=106>Men spit on Him.</s>
<s snum=107>God allowed it.</s>
<s snum=108>They called Him a devil.</s>
<s snum=109>God withheld His wrath.</s>
<s snum=110>Finally men arrested Him, gave Him a mock trial, flogged Him, nailed Him on a cross and hung Him between earth and heaven; and God allowed it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=111>You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily present.</s>
<s snum=112>You can ignore Him.</s>
<s snum=113>You can ignore His Book, the Bible, and His church.</s>
<s snum=114>You can laugh at His blood-bought salvation, curse His followers, and laugh at hell.</s>
<s snum=115>It is permitted.</s>
<s snum=116>The eternal Christ may knock at your soul's door, calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven.</s>
<s snum=117>You may refuse Him, spit on Him, call Him a devil, curse Him.</s>
<s snum=118>It is permitted.</s>
<s snum=119>You may take His name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose.</s>
<s snum=120>He is in your hands- now.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=121>On the other hand, you may seek His favor, humble yourself before Him and beg His mercy, implore His forgiveness, forsake your sins, and abandon your whole life to Him.</s>
<s snum=122>He has said, ``Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me'' (Revelation 3:20).</s>
<s snum=123>The choice is up to you.</s>
<s snum=124>The latch is on your side of the door.</s>
<s snum=125>The choice is yours: the revellings and banquetings of this world or quiet communion with God; the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of Holy Spirit discipline.</s>
<s snum=126>The choice is yours: God is in your hands, now.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=127>God has already set the day when you will be in His hands.</s>
<s snum=128>What He does with you then depends on what you do with Him now.</s>
<s snum=129>Then it will be a ``fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God'' if you have abused Him in your hands.</s>
