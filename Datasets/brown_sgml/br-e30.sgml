<p>
<s snum=27>Have you considered using vending equipment to replace or reduce the number of cafeteria employees?</s>

</p>
<p>
<s snum=29>Have you checked the cost of subcontracting your cafeteria operation in order to save administrative costs?</s>

</p>
<p>
<s snum=36>Have you audited your program recently to weed out those phases that draw least participation?</s>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<hl>TRANSPORTATION AND PARKING</hl>
<p>
<s snum=44>Do you know the trend in your cost of maintaining access roads and parking lots?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=45>If you use parking attendants, can they be replaced by automatic parking gates?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=46>Will your local bus company erect and/or maintain the bus stops at your plant?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=47>If you provide inter-plant transportation, can this be replaced by available public transportation?</s>

</p>

</p>
<p>
<s snum=53>Can vacations be spaced throughout the 12 months to minimize the number of employee fill-ins?</s>

<hl>RETIREMENT</hl>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<s snum=57>What sort of effort do you make to assure that older or disabled workers are fully productive?</s>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<hl>MEDICAL AND HEALTH</hl>
<p>
<s snum=60>Can you share medical facilities and staff with neighboring plants?</s>

<p>
<s snum=61>If you have a full-time doctor now, can he be replaced with a part-time doctor or one who serves on a fee-per-case basis only?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=62>Can your plant nurse be replaced by a trained first-aid man who works full-time on some other assignment?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=63>Do you rigidly distinguish between job- and non-job-connected health problems and avoid treating the latter?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=64>Are you indiscriminantly offering unnecessary medical services- flu shots, sun lamp treatments, etc.?</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=65>If you have an annual or regular physical examination program, is it worth what it is costing you?</s>
</p>
<hl>A PROGRAM TO FIT YOUR NEEDS</hl>
<p>
<s snum=66>Consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee benefit program.</s>
<s snum=67>Too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=68>But even if that other plant employs the same number of workers and makes the same product, there are other facts to consider.</s>
<s snum=69>How old is your working force?</s>
<s snum=70>What's your profit margin?</s>
<s snum=71>In what section of the country are you located?</s>
<s snum=72>Are you in a rural or urban area?</s>
<s snum=73>These factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=74>Above all, don't set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good will.</s>
<s snum=75>Unions stress fringe benefits, but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=76>Aim to balance your employee benefit package.</s>
<s snum=77>Some plants go overboard on one type of fringe- say a liberal retirement plan- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere.</s>
<s snum=78>They're asking for union trouble.</s>
</p>
<hl>COMMUNICATIONS</hl>
<p>
<s snum=79>If you want credit for your employee services program, let your workers know what they're entitled to.</s>
<s snum=80>Encourage them to exercise their benefits.</s>
<s snum=81>This can be done by stories in your house organs, posters, special publications, letters to workers' homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=82>Some companies find a little imagination helpful.</s>
<s snum=83>Hallmark Cards, Inc., Kansas City, Mo., has a do-it-yourself quiz game called ``Benefit Bafflers'', which it distributes to employees.</s>
<s snum=84>~M + ~R Dietetic Laboratories, Inc., Columbus, gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook- each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe.</s>
<s snum=85>U. S. Rubber Company, New York, passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits.</s>
<s snum=86>The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package, for example, costs $227.72.</s>
</p>
<hl>INSURANCE</hl>
<p>
<s snum=87>Have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically.</s>
<s snum=88>You may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible, thereby alerting you to desirable revisions.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=89>Check to see if some of your benefits- such as on-the-job disability pay- can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=90>Use deductable insurance wherever feasible.</s>
<s snum=91>It can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates.</s>
<s snum=92>Also, beware of open-end policies, especially in the medical field.</s>
<s snum=93>This will mean that every time there's an increase in hospital rates your cost will go up in like manner.</s>
<s snum=94>Put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=95>Don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death.</s>
<s snum=96>Generally, your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement.</s>
</p>
<hl>SPECIAL TIME OFF</hl>
<p>
<s snum=97>In granting bereavement leaves, specify the maximum time off and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify.</s>
<s snum=98>Thus, you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin's funeral.</s>
<s snum=99>Also, reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you'll probably never use it.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=100>Coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated.</s>
<s snum=101>Vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time.</s>
<s snum=102>If coffee is sold at the cafeteria, let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group.</s>
<s snum=103>Consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas.</s>
<s snum=104>Make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers, if you are supplying the coffee.</s>
<s snum=105>Otherwise, you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers.</s>
</p>
<hl>RETIREMENT POLICIES</hl>
<p>
<s snum=106>Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company.</s>
<s snum=107>And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age.</s>
<s snum=108>Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements tied into your pension plan.</s>
<s snum=109>Younger men usually don't think of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they're liable to change jobs several times before settling down.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=110>Choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans.</s>
<s snum=111>There are two sides of a coin for this decision.</s>
<s snum=112>Workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to.</s>
<s snum=113>And they can at least collect the money they put in, plus interest, when they leave the company.</s>
<s snum=114>A non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he retires.</s>
<s snum=115>Thus, there is an added incentive to stay on the job.</s>
</p>
<hl>HOLIDAYS</hl>
<p>
<s snum=116>Make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working.</s>
<s snum=117>These include:</s>
<s snum=118>leaves of absences, illnesses, and layoffs.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=119>Consider adopting a system of holidays in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant.</s>
<s snum=120>It's usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods.</s>
<s snum=121>For example, the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's birthday.</s>
<s snum=122>This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=123>Require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay.</s>
<s snum=124>This cuts the absentee rate.</s>
</p>
<hl>EATING FACILITIES</hl>
<p>
<s snum=125>Consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias.</s>
<s snum=126>Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices, and at a profit to you.</s>
<s snum=127>If a concessionaire runs the cafeteria, keep an eye out for quality and price.</s>
<s snum=128>If the soup tastes like dishwater, your employees won't blame the concessionaire.</s>
<s snum=129>You'll take the rap.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=130>Check your cafeteria location to make sure it's convenient for most employees.</s>
<s snum=131>You may save valuable production minutes with a change.</s>
</p>
<hl>VACATIONS</hl>
<p>
<s snum=132>Spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks.</s>
<s snum=133>This will cut the expense of vacation replacements.</s>
<s snum=134>And with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates.</s>
</p>
<p>
<s snum=135>Also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation.</s>
<s snum=136>You might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year.</s>
