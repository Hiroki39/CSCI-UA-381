00/wsj_0001:Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V., the Dutch publishing group. 
00/wsj_0002:Rudolph Agnew, 55 years old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, was named a nonexecutive director of this British industrial conglomerate. 
00/wsj_0003:A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago, researchers reported. 
00/wsj_0003:Lorillard Inc., the unit of New York-based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes, stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956. 
00/wsj_0003:Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago, the latest results appear in today's New England Journal of Medicine, a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem. 
00/wsj_0003:We're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties.
00/wsj_0003:Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes. "We have no useful information on whether users are at risk," said James A. Talcott of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
00/wsj_0003:Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University. 
00/wsj_0003:The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in "very modest amounts" in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956.
00/wsj_0003:Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases, including three with recently diagnosed cancer.
00/wsj_0003:The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma, lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected, the researchers said. 
00/wsj_0003:"The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos-related diseases," said Dr. Talcott. 
00/wsj_0003:The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton, Mass., paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries, he said.
00/wsj_0003:The finding probably will support those who argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos, chrysotile, found in most schools and other buildings, Dr. Talcott said. 
00/wsj_0003:The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that doesn't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth, needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles, according to Brooke T. Mossman, a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine.
00/wsj_0003:In July, the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos.
00/wsj_0003:By 1997, almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed. 
00/wsj_0003:Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used.
00/wsj_0003:Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin, poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters.
00/wsj_0003:Workers described "clouds of blue dust" that hung over parts of the factory, even though exhaust fans ventilated the area. 
00/wsj_0003:"There's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases," said Darrell Phillips, vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose. "But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago.
00/wsj_0004:The average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45% from 8.47% for the week ended Tuesday.
00/wsj_0004:Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year. 
00/wsj_0004:Average maturity of the funds' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days, the longest since early August, according to Donoghue's.
00/wsj_0004:Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner. 
00/wsj_0004:Nevertheless, said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report, yields "may blip up again before they blip down" because of recent rises in short-term interest rates.
00/wsj_0004:Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $1.5 billion during the latest week, to $352.7 billion. 
00/wsj_0004:Dreyfus World-Wide Dollar, the top-yielding fund, had a seven-day compound yield of 9.37% during the latest week, down from 9.45% a week earlier.
00/wsj_0004:The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12%, down from 8.14%.
00/wsj_0005:J.P. Bolduc, vice chairman of W.R. Grace & Co., which holds a 83.4% interest in this energy-services company, was elected a director.
00/wsj_0005:W.R. Grace holds three of Grace Energy's seven board seats. 
00/wsj_0006:Pacific First Financial Corp. said shareholders approved its acquisition by Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto for $27 a share, or $212 million. 
00/wsj_0007:McDermott International Inc. said its Babcock & Wilcox unit completed the sale of its Bailey Controls Operations to Finmeccanica S.p.
00/wsj_0007:It employs 2,700 people and has annual revenue of about $370 million. 
00/wsj_0008:The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress hasn't lifted the ceiling on government debt. 
00/wsj_0008:Until Congress acts, the government hasn't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind, the Treasury said. 
00/wsj_0009:Clark J. Vitulli was named senior vice president and general manager of this U.S. sales and marketing arm of Japanese auto maker Mazda Motor Corp.
00/wsj_0009:Previously, Mr. Vitulli, 43 years old, was general marketing manager of Chrysler Corp. 's Chrysler division.
00/wsj_0010:When it's time for their biannual powwow, the nation's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs. 
00/wsj_0010:The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting.
00/wsj_0010:The idea, of course: to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt isn't so rusty after all, that it's a good place for a company to expand. 
00/wsj_0010:On the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag, along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory. 
00/wsj_0010:For starters, the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist-comedian Victor Borge.
00/wsj_0010:The next morning, with a police escort, busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, unimpeded by traffic or red lights.
00/wsj_0010:Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom, nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline, lobster consomme, veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce.
00/wsj_0011:South Korea registered a trade deficit of $101 million in October, reflecting the country's economic sluggishness, according to government figures released Wednesday. 
00/wsj_0011:South Korea's economic boom, which began in 1986, stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes, trade conflicts and sluggish exports.
00/wsj_0011:Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $68 billion. 
00/wsj_0011:Despite the gloomy forecast, South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $71 million so far this year. 
00/wsj_0012:The new ad plan from Newsweek, a unit of the Washington Post Co., is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years.
00/wsj_0012:Mr. Spoon said the plan is not an attempt to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989; Newsweek's ad pages totaled 1,620, a drop of 3.2% from last year, according to Publishers Information Bureau. "What matters is what advertisers are paying per page, and in that department we are doing fine this fall," said Mr. Spoon. 
00/wsj_0012:Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers, such as telephones or watches.
00/wsj_0012:However, none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently.
00/wsj_0012:According to Audit Bureau of Circulations, Time, the largest newsweekly, had average circulation of 4,393,237, a decrease of 7.3%.
00/wsj_0012:Newsweek's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453, flat from the same period last year.
00/wsj_0013:New England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, saying that the risks were too high and the potential payoff too far in the future to justify a higher offer. 
00/wsj_0013:The move leaves United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire, which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company. 
00/wsj_0013:New England Electric, based in Westborough, Mass., had offered $2 billion to acquire PS of New Hampshire, well below the $2.29 billion value United Illuminating places on its bid and the $2.25 billion Northeast says its bid is worth.
00/wsj_0013:PS of New Hampshire, Manchester, N.H., values its internal reorganization plan at about $2.2 billion. 
00/wsj_0013:John Rowe, president and chief executive officer of New England Electric, said the company's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- didn't come true. "When we evaluated raising our bid, the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years, and the rewards seemed a long way out.
00/wsj_0013:No matter who owns PS of New Hampshire, after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation, he said. "That attracts attention . . . it was just another one of the risk factors" that led to the company's decision to withdraw from the bidding, he added. 
00/wsj_0013:Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc., the financial adviser to the troubled company's equity holders, said the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process.
00/wsj_0013:Separately, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down for now a request by Northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of PS of New Hampshire.
00/wsj_0013:PS of New Hampshire shares closed yesterday at $3.75, off 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
00/wsj_0014:Norman Ricken, 52 years old and former president and chief operating officer of Toys "R" Us Inc., and Frederick Deane Jr., 63, chairman of Signet Banking Corp., were elected directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain.
00/wsj_0015:The refund was about $55 million more than previously ordered by the Illinois Commerce Commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility. 
00/wsj_0015:State court Judge Richard Curry ordered Edison to make average refunds of about $45 to $50 each to Edison customers who have received electric service since April 1986, including about two million customers who have moved during that period.
00/wsj_0015:Judge Curry ordered the refunds to begin Feb. 1 and said that he wouldn't entertain any appeals or other attempts to block his order by Commonwealth Edison. "The refund pool . . . may not be held hostage through another round of appeals," Judge Curry said. 
00/wsj_0015:The exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual collections made until Dec. 31 of this year.
00/wsj_0015:For 1988, Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of $737.5 million, or $3.01 a share. 
00/wsj_0015:In August, the commission ruled that between $190 million and $195 million of the plant's construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded, plus interest.
00/wsj_0015:Last year Commonwealth Edison had to refund $72.7 million for poor performance of its LaSalle I nuclear plant. 
00/wsj_0016:Japan's domestic sales of cars, trucks and buses in October rose 18% from a year earlier to 500,004 units, a record for the month, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said. 
00/wsj_0016:The strong growth followed year-to-year increases of 21% in August and 12% in September.
00/wsj_0016:Sales of passenger cars grew 22% from a year earlier to 361,376 units.
00/wsj_0016:Sales of medium-sized cars, which benefited from price reductions arising from introduction of the consumption tax, more than doubled to 30,841 units from 13,056 in October 1988. 
00/wsj_0017:Texas Instruments Japan Ltd., a unit of Texas Instruments Inc., said it opened a plant in South Korea to manufacture control devices. 
00/wsj_0018:The survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity -- and longevity -- of its chairman and chief designer, Seymour Cray. 
00/wsj_0018:Not only is development of the new company's initial machine tied directly to Mr. Cray, so is its balance sheet.
00/wsj_0018:While many of the risks were anticipated when Minneapolis-based Cray Research first announced the spinoff in May, the strings it attached to the financing hadn't been made public until yesterday. 
00/wsj_0018:"We didn't have much of a choice," Cray Computer's chief financial officer, Gregory Barnum, said in an interview. "The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray-3, and without him it could not be completed.
00/wsj_0018:The filing on the details of the spinoff caused Cray Research stock to jump $2.875 yesterday to close at $38 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
00/wsj_0018:Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research's decision to link its $98.3 million promissory note to Mr. Cray's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company. "It has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor," said Gary P. Smaby of Smaby Group Inc., Minneapolis. "Cray Computer will be a concept stock," he said. "You either believe Seymour can do it again or you don't." 
00/wsj_0018:The SEC documents describe those chips, which are made of gallium arsenide, as being so fragile and minute they will require special robotic handling equipment.
00/wsj_0018:Cray Computer also will face intense competition, not only from Cray Research, which has about 60% of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the C-90 machine, a direct competitor with the Cray-3, in 1991.
00/wsj_0018:Under terms of the spinoff, Cray Research stockholders are to receive one Cray Computer share for every two Cray Research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks.
00/wsj_0018:Without the Cray-3 research and development expenses, the company would have been able to report a profit of $19.3 million for the first half of 1989 rather than the $5.9 million it posted.
00/wsj_0018:Regarded as the father of the supercomputer, Mr. Cray was paid $600,000 at Cray Research last year.
00/wsj_0018:Cray Computer, which currently employs 241 people, said it expects a work force of 450 by the end of 1990. 
00/wsj_0019:Mr. Stevens was executive vice president of this electric-utility holding company.
00/wsj_0019:Arthur A. Hatch, 59, was named executive vice president of the company.
00/wsj_0019:He was previously president of the company's Eastern Edison Co. unit.
00/wsj_0019:John D. Carney, 45, was named to succeed Mr. Hatch as president of Eastern Edison.
00/wsj_0019:Previously he was vice president of Eastern Edison.
00/wsj_0019:Robert P. Tassinari, 63, was named senior vice president of Eastern Utilities.
00/wsj_0020:The U.S., claiming some success in its trade diplomacy, removed South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries it is closely watching for allegedly failing to honor U.S. patents, copyrights and other intellectual-property rights. 
00/wsj_0020:However, five other countries -- China, Thailand, India, Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced.
00/wsj_0020:Under the new U.S. trade law, those countries could face accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they don't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring. 
00/wsj_0020:Mrs. Hills said many of the 25 countries that she placed under varying degrees of scrutiny have made "genuine progress" on this touchy issue.
00/wsj_0020:She said there is "growing realization" around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations, and particularly the "creativity and inventiveness of an {offending} country's own citizens." 
00/wsj_0020:Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained to pursue movie and book pirates.
00/wsj_0020:Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by initialing a bilateral copyright agreement, amending its trademark law and introducing legislation to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films.
00/wsj_0020:That measure could compel Taipei's growing number of small video-viewing parlors to pay movie producers for showing their films. 
00/wsj_0020:Those countries -- including Japan, Italy, Canada, Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed to pose less-serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the "priority" list. 
00/wsj_0020:Gary Hoffman, a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual-property cases, said the threat of U.S. retaliation, combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country's own interest, prompted the improvements made by South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. "What this tells us is that U.S. trade law is working," he said.
00/wsj_0020:He said Mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law. 
00/wsj_0020:Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about "disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia." She didn't elaborate, although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey. 
00/wsj_0020:The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30.
00/wsj_0020:So far, Mrs. Hills hasn't deemed any cases bad enough to merit an accelerated investigation under the so-called special 301 provision of the act. 
00/wsj_0021:Argentina said it will ask creditor banks to halve its foreign debt of $64 billion -- the third-highest in the developing world. 
00/wsj_0021:The declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is believed to be the first time such an action has been called for by an Argentine official of such stature.
00/wsj_0021:"Argentina aspires to reach a reduction of 50% in the value of its external debt," Mr. Rapanelli said through his spokesman, Miguel Alurralde. 
00/wsj_0021:Mr. Rapanelli recently has said the government of President Carlos Menem, who took office July 8, feels a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way the debt problem may be solved.
00/wsj_0022:(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 
00/wsj_0022:THREE COMPUTERS THAT CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched in 1977. 
00/wsj_0022:But the new 1977 PCs -- unlike earlier built-from-kit types such as the Altair, Sol and IMSAI -- had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories.
00/wsj_0022:William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language-housekeeper system for PCs, and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981.
00/wsj_0022:Alan F. Shugart, currently chairman of Seagate Technology, led the team that developed the disk drives for PCs.
00/wsj_0022:Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington, two Atlanta engineers, were co-developers of the internal modems that allow PCs to share data via the telephone. 
00/wsj_0023:Faulding said it owns 33% of Moleculon's voting stock and has an agreement to acquire an additional 19%.
00/wsj_0023:That stake, together with its convertible preferred stock holdings, gives Faulding the right to increase its interest to 70% of Moleculon's voting stock. 
00/wsj_0024:Oil production from Australia's Bass Strait fields will be raised by 11,000 barrels a day to about 321,000 barrels with the launch of the Whiting field, the first of five small fields scheduled to be brought into production before the end of 1990. 
00/wsj_0024:Esso Australia Ltd., a unit of New York-based Exxon Corp., and Broken Hill Pty. operate the fields in a joint venture. 
00/wsj_0024:The field has reserves of 21 million barrels.
00/wsj_0024:Esso said the fields were developed after the Australian government decided in 1987 to make the first 30 million barrels from new fields free of excise tax. 
00/wsj_0025:R.P. Scherer Corp. said it completed the $10.2 million sale of its Southern Optical subsidiary to a group led by the unit's president, Thomas R. Sloan, and other managers. 
00/wsj_0025:Following the acquisition of R.P. Scherer by a buy-out group led by Shearson Lehman Hutton earlier this year, the maker of gelatin capsules decided to divest itself of certain of its non-encapsulating businesses.
00/wsj_0025:The sale of Southern Optical is a part of the program. 
00/wsj_0026:The White House said President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that aren't produced in "significant quantities" in the U.S., the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions. 
00/wsj_0026:The action came in response to a petition filed by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations.
00/wsj_0026:Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches, covered by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications.
00/wsj_0026:The White House said Mr. Bush decided to grant duty-free status for 18 categories, but turned down such treatment for other types of watches "because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands." 
00/wsj_0026:Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches, including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled in the Philippines and other developing nations covered by the U.S. tariff preferences. 
00/wsj_0026:U.S. trade officials said the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president's action. 
00/wsj_0026:Imports of the types of watches that now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $37.3 million in 1988, a relatively small share of the $1.5 billion in U.S. watch imports that year, according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills. 
00/wsj_0027:Mr. Stronach will direct an effort to reduce overhead and curb capital spending "until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained," Magna said. 
00/wsj_0027:The company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years, despite steady sales growth. 
00/wsj_0027:Magna recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the company's Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars (US$13.73).
00/wsj_0027:Mr. Stronach, founder and controlling shareholder of Magna, resigned as chief executive officer last year to seek, unsuccessfully, a seat in Canada's Parliament. 
00/wsj_0027:Magna said Mr. McAlpine resigned to pursue a consulting career, with Magna as one of his clients. 
00/wsj_0028:Lord Chilver, 63-year-old chairman of English China Clays PLC, was named a nonexecutive director of this British chemical company. 
00/wsj_0029:The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage-based instruments, Fannie Mae's chairman, David O. Maxwell, said at a news conference.
00/wsj_0029:He said more than 90% of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors.
00/wsj_0029:The latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman, Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. 
00/wsj_0029:First, they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline, and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates.
00/wsj_0029:Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1% of the $900 billion in such instruments outstanding, and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate.
00/wsj_0029:They also have become large purchasers of Fannie Mae's corporate debt, buying $2.4 billion in Fannie Mae bonds during the first nine months of the year, or almost a tenth of the total amount issued. 
00/wsj_0030:James L. Pate, 54-year-old executive vice president, was named a director of this oil concern, expanding the board to 14 members. 
00/wsj_0031:The company is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, giving it court protection from creditors' lawsuits while it attempts to work out a plan to pay its debts. 
00/wsj_0032:A., through its Montedison Acquisition N.V. indirect unit, began its $37-a-share tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of Erbamont N.V., a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the Netherlands. 
00/wsj_0032:The offer, advertised in today's editions of The Wall Street Journal, is scheduled to expire at the end of November. 
00/wsj_0032:Montedison currently owns about 72% of Erbamont's common shares outstanding. 
00/wsj_0033:Japan's reserves of gold, convertible foreign currencies, and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $1.82 billion in October to $84.29 billion, the Finance Ministry said.
00/wsj_0033:The protracted downturn reflects the intensity of Bank of Japan yen-support intervention since June, when the U.S. currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level. 
00/wsj_0034:It's the latest investment craze sweeping Wall Street: a rash of new closed-end country funds, those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country. 
00/wsj_0034:No fewer than 24 country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year, triple the level of all of 1988, according to Charles E. Simon & Co., a Washington-based research firm. 
00/wsj_0034:Next week, the Philippine Fund's launch will be capped by a visit by Philippine President Corazon Aquino -- the first time a head of state has kicked off an issue at the Big Board here. 
00/wsj_0034:The next province? "Anything's possible -- how about the New Guinea Fund?" quips George Foot, a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates of Northampton, Mass.
00/wsj_0034:The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the "closed-end fund mania" of the 1920s, Mr. Foot says, when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular.
00/wsj_0034:Unlike traditional open-end mutual funds, most of these one-country portfolios are the "closed-end" type, issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly. 
00/wsj_0034:The surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in New York or London.
00/wsj_0034:These funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets. 
00/wsj_0034:"People are looking to stake their claims" now before the number of available nations runs out, says Michael Porter, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., New York. 
00/wsj_0034:Financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities.
00/wsj_0034:Country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies. 
00/wsj_0034:What's so wild about the funds' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios.
00/wsj_0034:After trading at an average discount of more than 20% in late 1987 and part of last year, country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6%.
00/wsj_0034:The reason: Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold. 
00/wsj_0034:The newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds, Mr. Porter suggests.
00/wsj_0034:Nonetheless, plenty of U.S. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds.
00/wsj_0034:They argue that U.S. investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds; these so-called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the U.S.
00/wsj_0035:The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $188 million in pre-Communist Russian debts owed to the U.S. government, the State Department said. 
00/wsj_0035:The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July. 
00/wsj_0035:Under a 1934 law, the Johnson Debt Default Act, as amended, it's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government, unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
00/wsj_0035:But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the U.S. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend-lease program. 
00/wsj_0036:In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off, the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in September. 
00/wsj_0036:Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month.
00/wsj_0036:The purchasing managers, however, also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline. 
00/wsj_0036:In a separate report, the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $415.6 billion, not significantly different from the $415.8 billion reported for August.
00/wsj_0036:The figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns, but weren't adjusted for inflation. 
00/wsj_0036:Kenneth Mayland, economist for Society Corp., a Cleveland bank, said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off.
00/wsj_0036:They cite a lack of "imbalances" that provide early warning signals of a downturn. 
00/wsj_0036:Manufacturers' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5% in September to $497.34 billion, helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector.
00/wsj_0036:In its construction spending report, the Commerce Department said residential construction, which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending, was off 0.9% in September to an annual rate of $191.9 billion.
00/wsj_0036:Spending on private, nonresidential construction was off 2.6% to an annual rate of $99.1 billion with no sector showing strength.
00/wsj_0036:For the first nine months of the year, total construction spending ran about 2% above last year's level. 
00/wsj_0036:Although the purchasing managers' index continues to indicate a slowing economy, it isn't signaling an imminent recession, said Robert Bretz, chairman of the association's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc., Stamford, Conn.
00/wsj_0036:He said the index would have to be in the low 40% range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession. 
00/wsj_0036:Only 19% of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October, down from 27% in September.
00/wsj_0036:They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in October than they had for each of the five previous months.
00/wsj_0036:Each of the survey's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening. 
00/wsj_0036:It found that of the 73% who import, 10% said they imported more in October and 12% said they imported less than the previous month.
00/wsj_0036:He said that for the second month in a row, food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk.
00/wsj_0036:They blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high U.S. exports of dry milk, coupled with very low import quotas. 
00/wsj_0036:Here are the Commerce Department's figures for construction spending in billions of dollars at seasonally adjusted annual rates. 
00/wsj_0036:Here are the Commerce Department's latest figures for manufacturers in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted. 
00/wsj_0037:Judging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami's "A Wild Sheep Chase" (Kodansha, 320 pages, $18.95), baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common.
00/wsj_0037:For an American reader, part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in recognizing that Japan isn't the buttoned-down society of contemporary American lore.
00/wsj_0037:It's also refreshing to read a Japanese author who clearly doesn't belong to the self-aggrandizing "we-Japanese" school of writers who perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese, unfathomable by outsiders.
00/wsj_0037:If "A Wild Sheep Chase" carries an implicit message for international relations, it's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think. 
00/wsj_0037:That's not to say that the nutty plot of "A Wild Sheep Chase" is rooted in reality.
00/wsj_0037:A disaffected, hard-drinking, nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister, erudite mobster with a Stanford degree.
00/wsj_0037:But he is just one of several youthful writers -- Tokyo's brat pack -- who are dominating the best-seller charts in Japan.
00/wsj_0037:Their books are written in idiomatic, contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana. 
00/wsj_0037:In Robert Whiting's "You Gotta Have Wa" (Macmillan, 339 pages, $17.95), the Beatles give way to baseball, in the Nipponese version we would be hard put to call a "game." As Mr. Whiting describes it, Nipponese baseball is a "mirror of Japan's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony." "Wa" is Japanese for "team spirit" and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it.
00/wsj_0037:Polls once named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara, a "humble, uncomplaining, obedient soul," as the male symbol of Japan. 
00/wsj_0037:But other than the fact that besuboru is played with a ball and a bat, it's unrecognizable: Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter; ties are permitted -- even welcomed -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants, for example, must always wear ties when on the road. 
00/wsj_0037:"You Gotta Have Wa" is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers, rationed to two per team, fare in Japan.
00/wsj_0037:Despite the enormous sums of money they're paid to stand up at a Japanese plate, a good number decide it's not worth it and run for home. 
00/wsj_0037:It's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom Sony hosted for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo -- to the regret of both parties. 
00/wsj_0037:In sometimes amusing, more often supercilious, even vicious passages, Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers' lives -- at the regimented office, where employees are assigned lunch partners -- and at "home" in the austere company dormitory run by a prying caretaker. 
00/wsj_0037:Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark.
00/wsj_0037:It's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity, that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager, and that Sony was chary of letting a young, short-term American employee take on any responsibility.
00/wsj_0037:All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein, who went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring to invent another Walkman. 
00/wsj_0037:But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein, after he committed the social crime of making an appointment to see the venerable Akio Morita, founder of Sony.
00/wsj_0037:More and more corners of the globe are becoming free of tobacco smoke. 
00/wsj_0037:In Malaysia, Siti Zaharah Sulaiman, a deputy minister in the prime minister's office, launched a "No-Smoking Week" at the Mara Institute of Technology near Kuala Lumpur and urged other schools to ban on-campus smoking. 
00/wsj_0037:The study by the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency also found that the colony's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets, which include the U.S. and Japan.
00/wsj_0037:The survey found that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers espouse what it identified as materialistic values, compared with about one-third in Japan and the U.S.
00/wsj_0037:More than three in five said they are under a great deal of stress most of the time, compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in Japan. 
00/wsj_0037:The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu's proposal to build a $19 million conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now.
00/wsj_0037:Yasser Arafat has written to the chairman of the International Olympic Committee asking him to back a Palestinian bid to join the committee, the Palestine Liberation Organization news agency WAFA said.
00/wsj_0037:An official of the Palestinian Olympic Committee said the committee first applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application in August of this year.
00/wsj_0037:In ending Hungary's part of the project, Parliament authorized Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth to modify a 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia, which still wants the dam to be built. 
00/wsj_0037:A painting by August Strindberg set a Scandinavian price record when it sold at auction in Stockholm for $2.44 million. "Lighthouse II" was painted in oils by the playwright in 1901 . . . After years of decline, weddings in France showed a 2.2% upturn last year, with 6,000 more couples exchanging rings in 1988 than in the previous year, the national statistics office said.
00/wsj_0037:But the number of weddings last year -- 271,124 -- was still well below the 400,000 registered in 1972, the last year of increasing marriages. 
00/wsj_0038:BRAMALEA Ltd. said it agreed to issue 100 million Canadian dollars (US$85.1 million) of 10.5% senior debentures due Nov. 30, 1999, together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants.
00/wsj_0038:The Toronto-based real estate concern said each bond warrant entitles the holder to buy C$1,000 principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase.
00/wsj_0038:Bramalea said it expects to complete the issue by the end of the month. 
00/wsj_0039:As an actor, Charles Lane isn't the inheritor of Charlie Chaplin's spirit.
00/wsj_0039:In 1976, as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York, Mr. Lane shot "A Place in Time," a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets.
00/wsj_0039:Now, 13 years later, Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called "Sidewalk Stories," a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp.
00/wsj_0039:Of course, if the film contained dialogue, Mr. Lane's Artist would be called a homeless person.
00/wsj_0039:Composer Marc Marder, a college friend of Mr. Lane's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles, or even words, would. 
00/wsj_0039:Much of Mr. Lane's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets (though probably no more romanticized than Mr. Chaplin's notion of the Tramp as the good-hearted free spirit).
00/wsj_0039:Filmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill, the New York streets of "Sidewalk Stories" seem benign.
00/wsj_0039:The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village, on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers, magicians and other good-natured hustlers. (This clearly is not real life: no crack dealers, no dead-eyed men selling four-year-old copies of Cosmopolitan, no one curled up in a cardboard box.) 
00/wsj_0039:Then, just as the Tramp is given a blind girl to cure in "City Lights," the Artist is put in charge of returning a two-year-old waif (Nicole Alysia), whose father has been murdered by thugs, to her mother.
00/wsj_0039:She gives the Artist a sense of purpose, but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life.
00/wsj_0039:The beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night. 
00/wsj_0039:This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it. 
00/wsj_0039:He has a point he wants to make, and he makes it, with a great deal of force.
00/wsj_0039:The movie ends with sound, the sound of street people talking, and there isn't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough, beaten voices. 
00/wsj_0039:The French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his "Story of Women." He has made a harsh, brilliant picture -- one that's captivating -- about a character who, viewed from the most sympathetic angle, would seem disagreeable. 
00/wsj_0039:Yet this woman, Marie-Louise Giraud, carries historical significance, both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government's hypocrisy.
00/wsj_0039:While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews, its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor.
00/wsj_0039:There is very little to recommend "Old Gringo," a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution.
00/wsj_0039:Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory.
00/wsj_0039:I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot, and this one has Gregory Peck, in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die. 
00/wsj_0040:Boeing Co. said it is discussing plans with three of its regular Japanese suppliers to possibly help build a larger version of its popular 767 twin-jet. 
00/wsj_0040:The three Japanese companies build the body sections of the 767, accounting for a combined 15% of the aircraft.
00/wsj_0041:The irony is that the attack commercial, after getting a boost in last year's presidential campaign, has come of age in an off-off election year with only a few contests scattered across the country. 
00/wsj_0041:But in the three leading political contests of 1989, the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility, raising fears that this kind of mudslinging, empty of significant issues, is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content. 
00/wsj_0041:A trend that started with the first stirrings of politics, accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988, has reached an entirely new stage. 
00/wsj_0041:New York City: The screen fills with a small, tight facial shot of David Dinkins, Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City. "David Dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years," says a disembodied male voice. 
00/wsj_0041:And then this television commercial, paid for by Republican Rudolph Giuliani's campaign and produced by Roger Ailes, the master of negative TV ads, really gets down to business.
00/wsj_0041:"Nasty innuendoes," says John Siegal, Mr. Dinkins's issues director, "designed to prosecute a case of political corruption that simply doesn't exist." 
00/wsj_0041:Stung by the Giuliani ads, Mr. Dinkins's TV consultants, Robert Shrum and David Doak, finally unleashed a negative ad of their own.
00/wsj_0041:The screen shows two distorted, unrecognizable photos, presumably of two politicians. "Compare two candidates for mayor," says the announcer. "One says he's for banning cop-killer bullets.
00/wsj_0041:It's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate. 
00/wsj_0041:He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems, but he insists he made no secret of it.
00/wsj_0041:And, says Mr. Dinkins, he didn't know the man his campaign paid for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping.
00/wsj_0041:Virginia: Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force.
00/wsj_0041:Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag, an announcer talks about the "strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty" that Virginians have nurtured for generations.
00/wsj_0041:Then, just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen, the announcer continues: "On the issue of abortion, Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians." 
00/wsj_0041:That commercial -- which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion "even in cases of rape and incest," a charge Mr. Coleman denies -- changed the dynamics of the campaign, transforming it, at least in part, into a referendum on abortion.
00/wsj_0041:The ad prompted Mr. Coleman, the former Virginia attorney general, to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad. 
00/wsj_0041:The Coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal.
00/wsj_0041:So the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women, ask him about this law he tried to pass." 
00/wsj_0041:Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago, but he did so at the request of a constituent, a common legislative technique used by lawmakers.
00/wsj_0041:"People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner," says Mark Rozell, a political scientist at Mary Washington College. "Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and -- more important -- has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman." 
00/wsj_0041:Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning, but the truce lasted only hours.
00/wsj_0041:New Jersey: The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio's rival, Republican Rep. Jim Courter. "Remember Pinocchio?" says a female voice. "Consider Jim Courter." 
00/wsj_0041:Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus, and the female voice purrs, "That hazardous waste on his {Mr.
00/wsj_0041:In this one, the screen fills with photographs of both candidates. "Who's really lying?" asks a female voice. "Florio's lying," the voice goes on, because "the barrel on Courter's land . . . contained heating oil, was cleaned up and caused no pollution." 
00/wsj_0041:Stephen Salmore, a political scientist at New Jersey's Eagleton Institute, says it's another example of an ad that's true but not fully accurate.
00/wsj_0041:In 1966, on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor, GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person saying, "If you want to keep the crime rates high, O'Connor is your man." 
00/wsj_0042:A seat on the Chicago Board of Trade was sold for $350,000, down $16,000 from the previous sale last Friday. 
00/wsj_0043:But Japan's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions. 
00/wsj_0043:The flow of Japanese funds has set in motion "a process whereby these economies will be knitted together by the great Japanese investment machine," says Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Corp. 
00/wsj_0043:In Thailand, for example, the government's Board of Investment approved $705.6 million of Japanese investment in 1988, 10 times the U.S. investment figure for the year.
00/wsj_0043:But Asian nations' harsh memories of their military domination by Japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under Japanese economic hegemony now. 
00/wsj_0043:Because of budget constraints in Washington, the U.S. encourages Japan to share economic burdens in the region.
00/wsj_0043:Japan's swelling investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution.
00/wsj_0043:These nations' internal decisions "will be made in a way not to offend their largest aid donor, largest private investor and largest lender," says Richard Drobnick, director of the international business and research program at the University of Southern California's Graduate School of Business. 
00/wsj_0043:Rather, Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors, says Kent Calder, a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University.
00/wsj_0043:The economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet in Australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications.
00/wsj_0043:Participants will include the U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand as well as the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei. 
00/wsj_0043:In addition, the U.S. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the Pacific rim in a major speech by Secretary of State James Baker, following up a proposal made in January by Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke. 
00/wsj_0043:But maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region.
00/wsj_0043:Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries (although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia).
00/wsj_0043:While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan's enlarged role in Asia, they also convey an undertone of caution. "There's an understanding on the part of the U.S. that Japan has to expand its functions" in Asia, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for trade. "If they approach it with a benevolent, altruistic attitude, there will be a net gain for everyone." 
00/wsj_0043:The issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the U.S.'s leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U.S. troop reduction in South Korea.
00/wsj_0043:"They don't want Japan to monopolize the region and sew it up," says Chong-sik Lee, professor of East Asian politics at the University of Pennsylvania. 
00/wsj_0044:While giving the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to ninth graders at Greenville High School last March 16, she spotted a student looking at crib sheets. 
00/wsj_0044:She had seen cheating before, but these notes were uncanny. "A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance. . . . At the end of World War II, Germany surrendered before Japan. . . . The Senate-House conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the House and Senate in different forms." 
00/wsj_0044:Virtually word for word, the notes matched questions and answers on the social-studies section of the test the student was taking.
00/wsj_0044:In fact, the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section.
00/wsj_0044:The teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin -- considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school.
00/wsj_0044:Her story is partly one of personal downfall.
00/wsj_0044:In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer; of colleagues who say she brought them shame; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly; and of school-district officials stunned that despite the bald-faced nature of her actions, she became something of a local martyr. 
00/wsj_0044:Mrs. Yeargin's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform, where pressures on teachers are growing and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat.
00/wsj_0044:The 1987 statute Mrs. Yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of South Carolina's school-improvement laws.
00/wsj_0044:"There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores," says Walt Haney, an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College. "So efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise." And most disturbing, it is educators, not students, who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing. 
00/wsj_0044:Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so.
00/wsj_0044:After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students, Texas is revising its security practices. 
00/wsj_0044:And sales of test-coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming.
00/wsj_0044:These materials, including Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. 's Scoring High and Learning Materials -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets, according to some recent academic research.
00/wsj_0044:Use of Scoring High is widespread in South Carolina and common in Greenville County, Mrs. Yeargin's school district. 
00/wsj_0044:Since the reforms went in place, for example, no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina, although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination.
00/wsj_0044:Friends of Education rates South Carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating.
00/wsj_0044:Paul Sandifer, director of testing for the South Carolina department of education, says Mr. Cannell's allegations of cheating "are purely without foundation," and based on unfair inferences.
00/wsj_0044:Partly because of worries about potential abuse, however, he says the state will begin keeping closer track of achievement-test preparation booklets next spring. 
00/wsj_0044:Standing on a shaded hill in a run-down area of this old textile city, the school has educated many of South Carolina's best and brightest, including the state's last two governors, Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes and actress Joanne Woodward.
00/wsj_0044:But by the early 1980s, its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade. 
00/wsj_0044:"It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class," says Linda Ward, the school's principal. "Crime was awful, test scores were low, and there was no enrollment in honors programs." 
00/wsj_0044:Academically, Mrs. Ward says, the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two disparate, and evenly split, student groups: a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks, many of them poor, from run-down, inner city neighborhoods. 
00/wsj_0044:Another was Nancy Yeargin, who came to Greenville in 1985, full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward. 
00/wsj_0044:She won grant money for the school, advised cheerleaders, ran the pep club, proposed and taught a new "Cultural Literacy" class in Western Civilization and was chosen by the school PTA as "Teacher of the Year." 
00/wsj_0044:"She was an inspirational lady; she had it all together," says Laura Dobson, a freshman at the University of South Carolina who had Mrs. Yeargin in the teacher-cadet class last year.
00/wsj_0044:She says that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher.
00/wsj_0044:Because of deteriorating hearing, she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer. 
00/wsj_0044:But the most important source of points was student improvement on tests.
00/wsj_0044:Huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $5,000 in bonuses over two years -- a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $23,000. 
00/wsj_0044:When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time, she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students. 
00/wsj_0044:Mrs. Yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct. "I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation," she says. "Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions.
00/wsj_0044:Mrs. Yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift Greenville High School's overall test scores, usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers.
00/wsj_0044:They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help, although because the case wasn't tried in court, this evidence was never presented publicly. "That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child," says Joe Watson, the prosecutor in the case, who is also president of Greenville High School's alumni association.
00/wsj_0044:To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs. Yeargin won widespread local support.
00/wsj_0044:The show didn't give the particulars of Mrs. Yeargin's offense, saying only that she helped students do better on the test. "The message to the board of education out of all this is we've got to take a serious look at how we're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state," said the talk-show host.
00/wsj_0044:Partly because of the show, Mr. Watson says, the district decided not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record.
00/wsj_0044:And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case.
00/wsj_0044:On the back, the shirts read, "We have all the answers." Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin. "She did a lot of harm," says Cathryn Rice, who had discovered the crib notes. "We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay, and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us." 
00/wsj_0044:But several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores.
00/wsj_0044:Says Gayle Key, a mathematics teacher, "The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms.
00/wsj_0044:Mrs. Yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement, and because she was afraid of further charges.
00/wsj_0045:The mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test asks fifth graders: "What is another name for the Roman numeral IX?" It also asks them to add two-sevenths and three-sevenths. 
00/wsj_0045:What's more, the test and Learning Materials are both produced by the same company, Macmillan/McGraw-Hill, a joint venture of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Macmillan's parent, Britain's Maxwell Communication Corp. 
00/wsj_0045:But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of school-sponsored cheating. 
00/wsj_0045:He and other critics say such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests, which is to gauge learning progress. 
00/wsj_0045:"It's as if France decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class, and when everybody aces the test, they say their kids are good in European history," says John Cannell, an Albuquerque, N.M., psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization, Friends for Education, which has studied standardized testing. 
00/wsj_0045:The most widely used of these tests are Macmillan/McGraw's CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, by Houghton Mifflin Co.; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test. 
00/wsj_0045:Sales figures of the test-prep materials aren't known, but their reach into schools is significant.
00/wsj_0045:Macmillan/McGraw says "well over 10 million" of its Scoring High test-preparation books have been sold since their introduction 10 years ago, with most sales in the last five years.
00/wsj_0045:About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers' binders have also been sold in the past four years.
00/wsj_0045:Michael Kean, director of marketing for CTB Macmillan/McGraw, the Macmillan/McGraw division that publishes Learning Materials, says it isn't aimed at improving test scores.
00/wsj_0045:Mr. Kaminski, the schoolteacher, and William Mehrens, a Michigan State University education professor, concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials shouldn't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test.
00/wsj_0045:They devised a 69-point scale -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test -- to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade CAT. 
00/wsj_0045:Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures, metric measurement of volume, or pie and bar graphs, for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum, Mr. Kaminski says, the preparation kits wouldn't replicate too many, if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures.
00/wsj_0045:But Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills.
00/wsj_0045:In CAT sections where students' knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds is tested, the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know. 
00/wsj_0045:Learning Materials for the fifth-grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items. 
00/wsj_0045:Rick Brownell, senior editor of Scoring High, says that Messrs.
00/wsj_0045:Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring "the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format." He said authors of Scoring High "scrupulously avoid" replicating exact questions, but he doesn't deny that some items are similar. 
00/wsj_0045:When Scoring High first came out in 1979, it was a publication of Random House.
00/wsj_0045:In a 1985 advisory to educators, McGraw-Hill said Scoring High shouldn't be used because it represented a "parallel form" of the CAT and CTBS tests.
00/wsj_0045:But in 1988, McGraw-Hill purchased the Random House unit that publishes Scoring High, which later became part of Macmillan/McGraw.
00/wsj_0045:Brownell and Kean say they are unaware of any efforts by McGraw-Hill to modify or discontinue Scoring High. 
00/wsj_0046:Alleghany Corp. said it completed the acquisition of Sacramento Savings & Loan Association from the H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation for $150 million. 
00/wsj_0046:The Sacramento-based S&L, which has 44 branch offices in north central California, had assets of $2.4 billion at the end of September.
00/wsj_0047:The Department of Health and Human Services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants. 
00/wsj_0047:Medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's.
00/wsj_0047:But anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions. 
00/wsj_0047:James Mason, assistant secretary for health, said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research "should be continued indefinitely." He said the ban won't stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that doesn't involve transplants. 
00/wsj_0047:Department officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Mason's ruling, which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health.
00/wsj_0047:The controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health, aware of the policy implications of its research, asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson's disease.
00/wsj_0047:The department placed a moratorium on the research, pending a review of scientific, legal and ethical issues. 
00/wsj_0047:A majority of an NIH-appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions, but the issue became embroiled in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding.
00/wsj_0047:The dispute has hampered the administration's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control. 
00/wsj_0047:Dr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. 
00/wsj_0047:Earlier this week, Dr. Sullivan tried to defuse these charges by stressing that candidates to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged by "standards of scientific and administrative excellence," not politics. 
00/wsj_0047:But the administration's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists. "When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground, there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications," says Myron Genel, associate dean of the Yale Medical School. "The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized, so that no mechanism exists" for finding a middle ground. 
00/wsj_0047:Yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants.
00/wsj_0047:But Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Mason's ruling may discourage private funding. "The unavailability of federal funds, and the climate in which the decision was made, certainly don't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support," he said. 
00/wsj_0047:Despite the flap over transplants, federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts. "Such research may ultimately result in the ability to regenerate damaged tissues or to turn off genes that cause cancer" or to regulate genes that cause Down's syndrome, the leading cause of mental retardation, according to an NIH summary.
00/wsj_0047:The NIH currently spends about $8 million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $8 billion. 
00/wsj_0048:The Nasdaq composite index added 1.01 to 456.64 on paltry volume of 118.6 million shares.
00/wsj_0048:In terms of volume, it was an inauspicious beginning for November.
00/wsj_0048:Yesterday's share turnover was well below the year's daily average of 133.8 million.
00/wsj_0048:In October, the busiest month of the year so far, daily volume averaged roughly 145 million shares. 
00/wsj_0048:The Nasdaq 100 index of the biggest nonfinancial stocks gained 1.39 to 446.62.
00/wsj_0048:The index of the 100 largest Nasdaq financial stocks rose modestly as well, gaining 1.28 to 449.04.
00/wsj_0048:The bank stocks got a boost when Connecticut Bank & Trust and Bank of New England said they no longer oppose pending legislation that would permit banks from other regions to merge with Connecticut and Massachusetts banks.
00/wsj_0048:Bank of New England's shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
00/wsj_0048:The stocks of banking concerns based in Massachusetts weren't helped much by the announcement, traders said, because many of those concerns have financial problems tied to their real-estate loan portfolios, making them unattractive takeover targets. 
00/wsj_0048:But speculators, anticipating that Connecticut will approve a law permitting such interstate banking soon, immediately bid up shares of Connecticut banks on the news. "A lot of the stocks that have been under water finally saw a reason to uptick," said George Jennison, head trader of banking issues in Shearson Lehman Hutton's OTC department. 
00/wsj_0048:The Stamford, Conn., concern has agreed to a buy-out by Bank of New York in a transaction with an indicated value of about $100 a share that expires next August.
00/wsj_0048:First Constitution has signed a merger agreement with WFRR L.P. and GHKM Corp., under which all of its common shares will be acquired for $25 each, or $273.5 million. 
00/wsj_0048:Centerbank added 5/8 to 8 3/4; shares of NESB, a New London-based bank holding company, rose 5/8 to 5 7/8. 
00/wsj_0048:Among other banking issues, Pennview Savings Association leapt more than 44% with a gain of 6 5/8 to 21 5/8.
00/wsj_0048:The Pennsylvania bank agreed to be acquired in a merger with Univest Corp. of Pennsylvania for $25.50 a share.
00/wsj_0048:Valley Federal Savings & Loan, a California thrift issue, gained 1 to 4 1/4 after reporting a third-quarter loss of $70.7 million after an $89.9 million pretax charge mostly related to its mobile home financing unit. 
00/wsj_0048:The two concerns said they entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ratners will begin a tender offer for all of Weisfield's common shares for $57.50 each. 
00/wsj_0048:Also on the takeover front, Jaguar's ADRs rose 1/4 to 13 7/8 on turnover of 4.4 million.
00/wsj_0048:Heritage Media, which already owns about 51% of POP Radio, proposed paying POP Radio shareholders with shares of a new class of Heritage Media preferred stock that would be convertible into four shares of Heritage Media's common. 
00/wsj_0048:Giant Group is led by three Rally's directors, Burt Sugarman, James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II, who earlier this month indicated they had a 42.5% stake in Rally's and planned to seek a majority of seats on Rally's nine-member board. 
00/wsj_0048:SCI Systems slipped 7/8 to 10 on volume of 858,000 shares.
00/wsj_0048:In the year-earlier period, SCI had net income of $4.8 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $225.6 million. 
00/wsj_0049:The warnings, issued to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week, have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar, who claim the information is protected by attorney-client privilege. 
00/wsj_0049:The IRS warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than $10,000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions "in the course of trade or business" to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300.
00/wsj_0049:"This form forces a lawyer to become, in effect, a witness against his client," said Neal R. Sonnett, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. "The IRS is asking lawyers to red-flag a criminal problem to the government," added Mr. Sonnett, a Miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer-generated IRS forms sent by certified mail. 
00/wsj_0049:The American Bar Association's House of Delegates passed a resolution in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement.
00/wsj_0049:Michael Ross, a New York lawyer who heads the ABA's grand jury committee, said that lawyers are prohibited by the ABA's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death. 
00/wsj_0049:Mr. Ross said he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department, which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers, to discuss the issue last May.
00/wsj_0049:But in the letters sent in recent days, Christopher J. Lezovich of the IRS computing center in Detroit, told attorneys that "failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated." In some cases, the IRS asked for information dating back to forms it received in 1985. 
00/wsj_0049:Individuals familiar with the Justice Department's policy said that Justice officials hadn't any knowledge of the IRS's actions in the last week. 
00/wsj_0049:Lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients, that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors.
00/wsj_0049:Prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business.
00/wsj_0049:In a number of recent cases, federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential. 
00/wsj_0049:The reason: the refusal of Congress to give federal judges a raise. 
00/wsj_0049:"A couple of my law clerks were going to pass me in three or four years, and I was afraid I was going to have to ask them for a loan," the judge quipped in an interview.
00/wsj_0049:When you become a federal judge, all of a sudden you are relegated to a paltry sum." 
00/wsj_0049:At his new job, as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento office of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, he will make out much better. 
00/wsj_0049:Cartoonist Garry Trudeau is suing the Writers Guild of America East for $11 million, alleging it mounted a "campaign to harass and punish" him for crossing a screenwriters' picket line. 
00/wsj_0049:Mr. Trudeau's attorney, Norman K. Samnick, said the harassment consists mainly of the guild's year-long threats of disciplinary action.
00/wsj_0049:ABORTION RULING UPHELD: A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that the U.S. can bar the use of federal funds for family-planning programs that include abortion-related services.
00/wsj_0049:A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted in 1988 prohibits the use of so-called Title X funds for programs that assist a woman in obtaining an abortion, such as abortion counseling and referrals.
00/wsj_0049:The rule also prohibits funding for activities that "encourage, promote or advocate abortion." Title X funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family-planning services, according to the opinion by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.
00/wsj_0049:The panel ruled that the restrictions don't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services don't violate the rights of pregnant women. 
00/wsj_0049:INQUIRY CLEARS TEXAS JUDGE of bias in comments on homosexual murder victims. 
00/wsj_0049:But Robert R. Murray, a special master appointed by the Texas Supreme Court, said Judge Hampton didn't breach any judicial standards of fairness, although he did violate the state's judicial code by commenting publicly on a pending case.
00/wsj_0049:Mr. Murray also said Judge Hampton's comments didn't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice. 
00/wsj_0049:Attorneys in the third stock-manipulation trial of GAF Corp. began opening arguments yesterday in the Manhattan courtroom of U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe.
00/wsj_0049:In an eight-count indictment, the government has charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., specialty chemical maker, and its Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin with attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock in November 1986.
00/wsj_0049:SWITCHING TO THE DEFENSE: A former member of the prosecution team in the Iran/Contra affair joined the Chicago firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt.
00/wsj_0049:Michael R. Bromwich, a member since January 1987 of the three-lawyer trial team in the prosecution of Oliver North, became a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the 520-lawyer firm.
00/wsj_0049:Mr. Bromwich, 35, also has served as deputy chief and chief of the narcotics unit for the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, based in Manhattan. 
00/wsj_0050:The tire maker said the buildings consist of 1.8 million square feet of office, manufacturing and warehousing space on 353 acres of land. 
00/wsj_0051:Fujitsu Ltd. 's top executive took the unusual step of publicly apologizing for his company's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects, while computer rival NEC Corp. made a written apology for indulging in the same practice. 
00/wsj_0051:Fujitsu said it bid the equivalent of less than a U.S. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years.
00/wsj_0051:NEC, one of its largest domestic competitors, said it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987.
00/wsj_0051:The Ministry of International Trade and Industry summoned executives from the companies to "make sure they understood" the concern about such practices, according to a government spokesman. "These cases lead to the loss of the firms' social and international credibility," a ministry statement said. 
00/wsj_0051:NEC released a statement saying, "We feel sorry for having caused trouble to society," a form of apology common in Japan for companies caught in embarrassing situations. 
00/wsj_0051:But in one of the auctions in question, International Business Machines Corp. made a bid substantially higher than the Fujitsu offer, according to the municipality.
00/wsj_0051:The U.S. government in recent years has accused Japanese companies of excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers -- products Fujitsu and NEC make. 
00/wsj_0051:The "one-yen" controversy first came to a head last week when the city of Hiroshima announced that Fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to map its waterworks.
00/wsj_0051:Fujitsu and NEC said they were still investigating, and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge.
00/wsj_0051:Mr. Yamamoto insisted that headquarters hadn't approved the bids, and that he didn't know about most of the cases until Wednesday. 
00/wsj_0051:"One yen is not ethical," Michio Sasaki, an official at Keidanren, the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, said. "Profit may be low, but at least costs should be covered." 
00/wsj_0052:PAPERS: Backe Group Inc. agreed to acquire Atlantic Publications Inc., which has 30 community papers and annual sales of $7 million.
00/wsj_0052:TV: Price Communications Corp. completed the sale of four of its TV stations to NTG Inc. for $120 million in cash and notes, retaining a 10% equity stake in the new concern.
00/wsj_0053:Michaels Stores Inc., which owns and operates a chain of specialty retail stores, said October sales rose 14.6% to $32.8 million from $28.6 million a year earlier. 
00/wsj_0054:Furukawa Co. of Japan said it will acquire two construction machinery plants and a sales unit in France formerly belonging to Dresser Industries Inc. of the U.S. 
00/wsj_0054:Furukawa said the purchase of the French and German plants together will total about 40 billion yen ($280 million). 
00/wsj_0057:But company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a $43 million pretax charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world-wide manufacturing operations, citing extended weakness in the market as well as a decision to switch to more economical production techniques. 
00/wsj_0057:"Over the summer months, there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector, our primary market," said Wilfred J. Corrigan, chairman and chief executive officer. "In addition, recent industry forecasts for 1990 indicate a slow environment, at least until midyear." As a result, the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and "make appropriate reductions" in operating expenses. 
00/wsj_0057:Not counting the extraordinary charge, the company said it would have had a net loss of $3.1 million, or seven cents a share.
00/wsj_0057:A year earlier, it had profit of $7.5 million, or 18 cents a share.
00/wsj_0057:Part of the problem is that chip buyers are keeping inventories low because of jitters about the course of the U.S. economy. 
00/wsj_0058:INGERSOLL-RAND Co. (Woodcliff Lake, N.J.) -- William G. Kuhns, former chairman and chief executive officer of General Public Utilities Corp., was elected a director of this maker of industrial and construction equipment, increasing board membership to 10. 
00/wsj_0059:Jay Goldinger, with Capital Insight Inc., reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well -- the mark climbed to 77.70 yen from 77.56 yen late Tuesday in New York -- the strength of the U.S. bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar-denominated bonds, rather than mark bonds. 
00/wsj_0059:In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 143.93 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 143.08 yen. 
00/wsj_0059:Douglas Madison, a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles, traced the dollar's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by Japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings. 
00/wsj_0059:He contends that the perception in Japan of a vitriolic U.S. response to Sony Corp. 's announcement of its purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. has been temporarily mollified.
00/wsj_0059:He cites the recent deal between the Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Rockefeller Group, as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the Georgia-Pacific Corp. takeover bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. as evidence. 
00/wsj_0059:The forthcoming maturity in November of a 10-year Japanese government yen-denominated bond issue valued at about $16 billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar-denominated instruments, according to Mr. Madison. 
00/wsj_0059:Meanwhile, traders in Tokyo say that the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates has spurred dollar buying by Japanese institutions. 
00/wsj_0059:The market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing U.S. economy, and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from Wall Street than U.S. economic indicators. 
00/wsj_0059:Dealers said the dollar merely drifted lower following the release Wednesday of the U.S. purchasing managers' report.
00/wsj_0059:The managers' index, which measures the health of the manufacturing sector, stood at 47.6% in October, above September's 46%, and also above average forecasts for the index of 45.3%. 
00/wsj_0059:Some dealers said the dollar was pressured slightly because a number of market participants had boosted their expectations in the past day and were looking for an index above 50, which indicates an expanding manufacturing economy.
00/wsj_0060:"The Cosby Show" may have single-handedly turned around ratings at NBC since its debut in 1984, and the Huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing Thursday night on the network. 
00/wsj_0060:But some of the TV stations that bought "Cosby" reruns for record prices two years ago aren't laughing much these days.
00/wsj_0060:The reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that air the shows.
00/wsj_0060:Meanwhile, stations are fuming because, many of them say, the show's distributor, Viacom Inc., is giving an ultimatum: Either sign new long-term commitments to buy future episodes or risk losing "Cosby" to a competitor.
00/wsj_0060:At the same time, Viacom is trying to persuade stations to make commitments to "A Different World," a spin-off of "Cosby" whose reruns will become available in 1991. 
00/wsj_0060:Viacom denies it's using pressure tactics. "We're willing to negotiate," says Dennis Gillespie, executive vice president of marketing. "We're offering this plan now because we feel it's the right time." 
00/wsj_0060:But, says the general manager of a network affiliate in the Midwest, "I think if I tell them I need more time, they'll take `Cosby' across the street," 
00/wsj_0060:One station manager says he believes Viacom's move is a "pre-emptive strike" because the company is worried that "Cosby" ratings will continue to drop in syndication over the next few years. "Cosby" is down a full ratings point in the week of Oct. 2-8 over the same week a year ago, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. 
00/wsj_0060:And executives at stations in such major markets as Washington; Providence, R.I.; Cleveland; Raleigh, N.C.; Minneapolis, and Louisville, Ky., say they may very well not renew "Cosby." Dick Lobo, the general manager of WTVJ, the NBC-owned station in Miami, for example, says the show has "been a major disappointment to us." "At the prices we were charged, there should have been some return for the dollar.
00/wsj_0060:Neil Kuvin, the general manager of WHAS, the CBS affiliate in Louisville, says "Cosby" gets the station's highest ratings and he's "pleased." But he adds, "I feel pressured, disappointed, uncomfortable and, frankly, quite angry with Viacom." 
00/wsj_0061:The Life Insurance Co. of Georgia has officially opened an office in Taipei. 
00/wsj_0061:David Wu, the company's representative in Taiwan, said Atlanta-based Life of Georgia will sell conventional life-insurance products. 
00/wsj_0061:Life of Georgia is part of the Nationale Nederlanden Group, based in the Netherlands. 
00/wsj_0062:In this era of frantic competition for ad dollars, a lot of revenue-desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers -- fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space.
00/wsj_0062:From an advertising standpoint, the problem is these offenders are likely to be some of the same folks that are major magazine advertisers these days. 
00/wsj_0062:With only two issues under its belt, Garbage has alienated some would-be advertisers and raised the ire of others.
00/wsj_0062:The magazine's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging's polystyrene foam, polyproplene and polyester film -- all plastic items they say are non-biodegradable. "It's precisely the kind of product that's created the municipal landfill monster," the editors wrote. 
00/wsj_0062:He admits, though, it isn't one of Campbell Soup's better products in terms of recyclability. 
00/wsj_0062:Some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk turning off Madison Avenue's big spenders. "You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you're going to make a run of it," says Mike White, senior vice president and media director at DDB Needham, Chicago. "The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base" of big-time ad spenders, he adds. 
00/wsj_0062:The first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers, including General Electric and Adolph Coors, but the majority were from companies like Waste Management Inc. and Bumkins International, firms that don't spend much money advertising and can't be relied on to support a magazine over the long haul. 
00/wsj_0062:Individual copies of the magazine sell for $2.95 and yearly subscriptions cost $21. (It is, of course, printed on recycled paper.) 
00/wsj_0062:According to Ms. Poore, Old-House Journal Corp., her publishing company, printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue.
00/wsj_0062:INTERPUBLIC ON TV: Interpublic Group said its television programming operations -- which it expanded earlier this year -- agreed to supply more than 4,000 hours of original programming across Europe in 1990.
00/wsj_0062:It said the programs, largely game shows, will be provided by its E.C. Television unit along with Fremantle International, a producer and distributor of game shows of which it recently bought 49%.
00/wsj_0062:It said that volume makes it the largest supplier of original TV programming in Europe.
00/wsj_0062:NEW ACCOUNT: CoreStates Financial Corp., Philadelphia, named Earle Palmer Brown & Spiro, Philadelphia, as agency of record for its $5 million account.
00/wsj_0062:LANDOR ASSOCIATES: Young & Rubicam said it completed its acquisition of Landor Associates, a San Francisco identity-management firm. 
00/wsj_0063:Sea Containers Ltd. said it might increase the price of its $70-a-share buy-back plan if pressed by Temple Holdings Ltd., which made an earlier tender offer for Sea Containers. 
00/wsj_0063:Sea Containers, a Hamilton, Bermuda-based shipping concern, said Tuesday that it would sell $1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50% of its common shares for $70 apiece. 
00/wsj_0063:Yesterday, Sea Containers' chief executive officer, James Sherwood, said in an interview that, under the asset-sale plan, Sea Containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $620 million.
00/wsj_0063:About $490 million of that would be allocated to the buy-back, leaving about $130 million, he said. 
00/wsj_0063:Temple added that Sea Containers is still mired in legal problems in Bermuda, where the Supreme Court has temporarily barred Sea Containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by Stena and Tiphook. {The court has indicated it will rule on the case by the end of the month.} 
00/wsj_0064:"Today's action," Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said, "represents another milestone in the ongoing program to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards." 
00/wsj_0064:Safety advocates, including some members of Congress, have been urging the department for years to extend car-safety requirements to light trucks and vans, which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the U.S.
00/wsj_0064:They didn't have much luck during the Reagan administration. "But now, there seems to be a fairly systematic effort to address the problem," said Chuck Hurley, vice president of communications for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. "We're in a very different regulatory environment." Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) praised the department's actions, noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light-truck deaths. "We could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof-crush standards," he said. 
00/wsj_0064:The roofs would be required to withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle.
00/wsj_0064:In Detroit, a Chrysler Corp. official said the company currently has no rear-seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks, but plans to begin phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year.
00/wsj_0064:John Leinonen, executive engineer of Ford Motor Co. 's auto-safety office, said Ford trucks have met car standards for roof-crush resistance since 1982.
00/wsj_0065:The multilevel railcars, scheduled for delivery in 1990, will be made by Thrall Manufacturing Co., a Chicago Heights, Ill., division of closely held Duchossois Industries Inc., Elmhurst, Ill.
00/wsj_0066:Sir Peter Walters, 58-year-old chairman of British Petroleum Co. until next March, joins the board of this cement products company on Dec. 1.
00/wsj_0067:Bank of New England Corp. said it has held talks with potential merger partners outside New England, although it added that nothing is imminent and it hasn't received any formal offers. 
00/wsj_0067:Currently, both Massachusetts and Connecticut, where most of Bank of New England's operations are, allow interstate banking only within New England. 
00/wsj_0067:Richard Driscoll, vice chairman of Bank of New England, told the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report, "Certainly, there are those outside the region who think of us prospectively as a good partner.
00/wsj_0067:A bank spokeswoman also declined to comment on any merger-related matters, but said the company decided to drop its opposition to the interstate banking legislation because "prevailing sentiment is in favor of passage." 
00/wsj_0067:Bank of New England has been hit hard by the region's real-estate slump, with its net income declining 42% to $121.6 million, or 61 cents a share, in the first nine months of 1989 from the year-earlier period.
00/wsj_0067:The company recently said it would sell some operations and lay off 4% of its work force, altogether reducing employment to less than 16,000 from about 18,000.
00/wsj_0067:It recently signed a preliminary agreement to negotiate exclusively with the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. for the sale of part of its leasing business to the Japanese bank. 
00/wsj_0068:The reduced dividend is payable Jan. 2 to stock of record Dec. 15.
00/wsj_0068:The Kearny, N.J.-based maker of hair accessories and other cosmetic products said it cut the dividend due to its third-quarter loss of $992,000, or 15 cents a share.
00/wsj_0068:In the year-ago quarter, the company reported net income of $1.9 million, or 29 cents a share.
00/wsj_0069:Michael Henderson, 51-year-old group chief executive of this U.K. metals and industrial materials maker, will become chairman in May, succeeding Ian Butler, 64, who is retiring.
00/wsj_0070:The company said holders of stock of record Nov. 10 will receive 1/10th of one cent a share as the redemption payment. 
00/wsj_0070:Giant Group is led by three Rally's directors, Burt Sugarman, James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II, who last month indicated they hold a 42.5% stake in Rally's and plan to seek a majority of seats on Rally's nine-member board. 
00/wsj_0071:When Warren Winiarski, proprietor of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley, announced a $75 price tag for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet this fall, few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked. "This is the peak of my wine-making experience," Mr. Winiarski declared when he introduced the wine at a dinner in New York, "and I wanted to single it out as such." 
00/wsj_0071:Diamond Creek 1985 Lake Vineyard Cabernet weighed in this fall with a sticker price of $100 a bottle. 
00/wsj_0071:One of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums -- wines limited in production, of exceptional quality (or so perceived, at any rate), and with exceedingly high prices.
00/wsj_0071:For years, this group included a stable of classics -- Bordeaux first growths (Lafite-Rothschild, Latour, Haut-Brion, Petrus), Grand Cru Burgundies (Romanee-Conti and La Tache) deluxe Champagnes (Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal), rarefied sweet wines (Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from Germany, and Biondi-Santi Brunello Riserva from Tuscany).
00/wsj_0071:In the last year or so, however, this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members.
00/wsj_0071:France can boast the lion's share of high-priced bottles.
00/wsj_0071:Bordeaux's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $60 to $80 each (except for the smallest in terms of production, Chateau Petrus, which costs around $250!).
00/wsj_0071:These prices seem rather modest, however, in light of other French wines from current vintages.
00/wsj_0071:In Champagne, some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward $100 a bottle.
00/wsj_0071:The great reds of the Rhone Valley have soared in price as well.
00/wsj_0071:None of France's wine regions can steal a march on Burgundy, however.
00/wsj_0071:The six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world, have commanded three-digit price tags for several years now.
00/wsj_0071:"There are certain cult wines that can command these higher prices," says Larry Shapiro of Marty's, one of the largest wine shops in Dallas. "What's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out.
00/wsj_0071:Wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines, Mr. Shapiro continued: "We've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the '40s and '50s, which go for $300 to $400 a bottle.
00/wsj_0071:Some of the newer wines, even at $90 to $100 a bottle or so, almost offer a bargain." 
00/wsj_0071:It's made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly (the last was 1979) and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987.
00/wsj_0071:Offering the wine at roughly $65 a bottle wholesale ($100 retail), he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers: 1) no, the wine is too high (2 responses); 2) yes, it's high but I'll take it (2 responses); 3) I'll take all I can get (58 responses).
00/wsj_0071:The wine was shipped in six-bottle cases instead of the usual 12, but even at that it was spread thin, going to 62 retailers in 28 states. 
00/wsj_0071:"We thought it was awfully expensive," said Sterling Pratt, wine director at Schaefer's in Skokie, Ill., one of the top stores in suburban Chicago, "but there are people out there with very different opinions of value.
00/wsj_0071:"It's just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people," added Larry Shapiro. "They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace {one of Diamond Creek's Cabernets} or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet, or the Petrus.
00/wsj_0071:That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly.
00/wsj_0071:But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago. "They won't buy if the quality is not there," said Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans. "Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less." Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines (like Grgich Hills Chardonnay, now $32) just to slow down movement, but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $30 to $40 range. 
00/wsj_0071:Image has, of course, a great deal to do with what sells and what doesn't, and it can't be forced.
00/wsj_0071:It's hardly a question of quality -- the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine, but, as Mr. Pratt noted, people have their own ideas about value. 
00/wsj_0071:It's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines aren't always walking out the door.
00/wsj_0071:In every major market in the U.S., for instance, you can buy '86 La Tache or Richebourg, virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux (except Petrus), as well as Opus One and Dominus from California and, at the moment, the Stag's Leap 1985 Cask 23. 
00/wsj_0071:With the biggest wine-buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach, it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare.
00/wsj_0072:Signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates, but it isn't clear whether the central bank will do so. 
00/wsj_0072:A survey by the Fed's 12 district banks shows economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks, while upward pressures on prices have moderated. "The economy is clearly slowing," says Robert Black, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank. 
00/wsj_0072:Nevertheless, both Mr. Guffey and Mr. Black say the slowdown so far is no cause for concern. "We're coming closer to achieving the stated objective of slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur," said Mr. Guffey. 
00/wsj_0072:Bush administration officials are looking to the Fed to bring down rates, and financial markets seem to be expecting easier credit as well. "I think the market had been expecting the Fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has to date," said Robert Johnson, vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co. 
00/wsj_0072:The Fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75% after the Oct. 13 stock market plunge, but has shown no sign of movement since. 
00/wsj_0072:And in the Chicago district, the report said, "a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types, including defense equipment, petroleum equipment, food packaging machinery and material handling equipment." Retail sales also were reported slow in most districts, particularly "for discretionary, big-ticket items such as furniture, home appliances and consumer electronics." And construction also was described as slow in most areas. 
00/wsj_0072:Several Fed governors in Washington have been pushing for easier credit; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move. 
00/wsj_0072:Mr. Black said he is "pleased" with the economy's recent performance, and doesn't see "a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession." 
00/wsj_0072:"There is always a chance of recession," added Mr. Guffey, "but if you ask me to put a percentage on it, I would think it's well below a 50% chance." 
00/wsj_0073:Integra-A Hotel & Restaurant Co. said its planned rights offering to raise about $9 million was declared effective and the company will begin mailing materials to shareholders at the end of this week. 
00/wsj_0073:Each right entitles the shareholder to buy $100 face amount of 13.5% bonds due 1993 and warrants to buy 23.5 common shares at 30 cents a share.
00/wsj_0073:Hallwood, a Cleveland merchant bank, owns about 11% of Integra. 
00/wsj_0075:"Each day that Congress fails to act . . . will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule, possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer," Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a speech prepared for delivery last night to a group of bankers. "To avoid these costs, and a possible default, immediate action is imperative." 
00/wsj_0075:The new securities, part of the federal government's regular quarterly refunding, will consist of: 
00/wsj_0075:-- $10 billion of three-year notes, to be auctioned Tuesday and to mature Nov. 15, 1992. 
00/wsj_0075:-- $10 billion of 10-year notes, to be auctioned Wednesday and to mature Nov. 15, 1999. 
00/wsj_0075:-- $10 billion of 30-year bonds, to be auctioned Thursday and to mature Aug. 15, 2019.
00/wsj_0075:None of the securities will be eligible for when-issued trading until Congress approves an increase in the debt ceiling, clearing the way for a formal offering, Mr. Basham said. 
00/wsj_0075:Auctions held in October and those scheduled for next week will raise a total of $25.6 billion. 
00/wsj_0075:The remaining $21.9 billion could be raised through the sale of short-term Treasury bills, two-year notes in November and five-year notes in early December, the Treasury said. 
00/wsj_0075:In the first three months of 1990, the Treasury estimates that it will have to raise between $45 billion and $50 billion, assuming that it decides to aim for a $10 billion cash balance at the end of March. 
00/wsj_0076:Reames, a maker and marketer of frozen noodles and pre-cooked pasta based in Clive, Iowa, has annual sales of about $11 million, Lancaster said. 
00/wsj_0077:Investors took advantage of Tuesday's stock rally to book some profits yesterday, leaving stocks up fractionally.
00/wsj_0077:But advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange were tidily ahead of declining stocks, 847 to 644.
00/wsj_0077:Long-term bond prices rose despite prospects of a huge new supply of Treasury debt this month.
00/wsj_0077:Analysts were disappointed that the enthusiasm investors showed for stocks in the wake of Georgia-Pacific's $3.18 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa evaporated so quickly.
00/wsj_0077:The industrial average jumped more than 41 points Tuesday as speculators rushed to buy shares of potential takeover targets.
00/wsj_0077:But with the end of the year in sight, money managers are eager to take profits and cut their risks of losing what for many have been exceptionally good returns in 
00/wsj_0077:The Federal Reserve's Beige Book, a summary of economic conditions across the country, indicated that the overall economy remains in a pattern of sluggish growth. 
00/wsj_0077:The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount.
00/wsj_0079:Eaton Corp. said it sold its Pacific Sierra Research Corp. unit to a company formed by employees of that unit.
00/wsj_0080:Analysts saw the latest offer as proof that Mr. Simmons, an aggressive and persistent investor, won't leave Georgia Gulf alone until some kind of transaction is completed. "He has clamped on their ankle like a pit bull," says Paul Leming, a vice president with Morgan Stanley & Co. "He appears to be in it for the long haul." Mr. Simmons and NL already own a 9.9% stake in Georgia Gulf. 
00/wsj_0080:Mr. Simmons owns 88% of Valhi Inc., which in turn owns two-thirds of NL. NL is officially making the offer. 
00/wsj_0080:J. Landis Martin, NL president and chief executive officer, said NL and Mr. Simmons cut the price they were proposing for Georgia Gulf because they initially planned a transaction that included about $250 million in equity and a substantial amount of high-yield subordinated debt.
00/wsj_0080:Mr. Martin said they haven't yet decided what their next move would be, but he didn't rule out the possibility of a consent solicitation aimed at replacing Georgia Gulf's board.
00/wsj_0080:Although Georgia Gulf hasn't been eager to negotiate with Mr. Simmons and NL, a specialty chemicals concern, the group apparently believes the company's management is interested in some kind of transaction.
00/wsj_0080:The management group owns about 18% of the stock, most purchased at nominal prices, and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold. 
00/wsj_0081:A licensing company representing the University of Pennsylvania added Johnson & Johnson to its lawsuit challenging a university faculty member over rights to Retin-A acne medicine. 
00/wsj_0081:University Patents Inc., based in Westport, Conn., said it seeks Johnson & Johnson's profits from sales of Retin-A, estimated at $50 million, a similar amount of punitive damages and the right to license Retin-A elsewhere. 
00/wsj_0081:In May, University Patents filed a suit in federal court in Philadelphia against Albert M. Kligman, a researcher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who developed Retin-A in the 1960s to combat acne.
00/wsj_0081:Dr. Kligman patented the medicine while employed by the University, but later licensed the Retin-A to a division of Johnson & Johnson. 
00/wsj_0082:Officials from both nations say the U.S. public's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in Washington.
00/wsj_0082:Not that Washington and Tokyo disagree on the Japanese acquisitions; indeed, each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the U.S. 
00/wsj_0082:Where they disagree is on the subject of U.S. direct investment in Japan.
00/wsj_0082:The U.S. wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment; Japan denies there are real barriers.
00/wsj_0082:The heated talk stirred up by recent Japanese investments in the U.S. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate, even though it's only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks, known as the Structural Impediments Initiative. 
00/wsj_0082:The Japanese "should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy," says Charles Dallara, U.S. assistant Treasury secretary, who has been in Tokyo this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders. 
00/wsj_0082:"We have a long history of maintaining an open direct-investment policy," Mr. Dallara says. "U.S. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment" in Japan. 
00/wsj_0082:One clear sign of Japan's nervousness came this week, when a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry devoted nearly all of a regular, half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the U.S. 
00/wsj_0082:"We believe that it is vitally important for those Japanese business interests {in the U.S.} to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people," said the spokesman, Taizo Watanabe.
00/wsj_0082:Fears that Japanese investors are buying up America have escalated sharply in the past several weeks, with Sony Corp. 's purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. from Coca-Cola Co. and Mitsubishi Estate Co. 's acquisition of a 51% holding in Rockefeller Group, the owner of some of midtown Manhattan's most exclusive real estate. 
00/wsj_0082:Even before those moves added fuel, the fires of discontent had been well stoked by the highly publicized experience in Japan of one U.S. investor, T. Boone Pickens Jr.
00/wsj_0082:While Mr. Dallara and Japanese officials say the question of investors' access to the U.S. and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public's attention, a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week's talks.
00/wsj_0082:Each side has a litany of recommendations for the other. 
00/wsj_0082:The U.S. says it is anxious for results. "We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues we've identified, and we need it by next spring," Mr. Dallara says. 
00/wsj_0082:After the first set of meetings two months ago, some U.S. officials complained that Japan hadn't come up with specific changes it was prepared to make.
00/wsj_0082:"Just to say the distribution system is wrong doesn't mean anything," says a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official. "We need to clarify what exactly is wrong with it." 
00/wsj_0082:That process of sorting out specifics is likely to take time, the Japanese say, no matter how badly the U.S. wants quick results.
00/wsj_0082:Since then, a team of about 15 MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials have crossed the globe gauging consumer prices.
00/wsj_0082:By Monday, they hope to have a sheaf of documents both sides can trust. 
00/wsj_0083:But for small American companies, it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help. 
00/wsj_0083:Take the deal with Candela Laser Corp., a Wayland, Mass., manufacturer of high-tech medical devices, which three years ago set its sights on Japan as an export market.
00/wsj_0083:Partly to help clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas company trying to penetrate Japan, tiny Candela turned to Mitsui & Co., one of Japan's largest trading companies, for investment. 
00/wsj_0083:It eventually secured Ministry of Health import approval for two Candela laser products -- one that breaks up kidney stones and another that treats skin lesions.
00/wsj_0083:At last count, Candela had sold $4 million of its medical devices in Japan. 
00/wsj_0083:In the first half of 1989 alone, Japanese corporations invested $214 million in minority positions in U.S. companies, a 61% rise from the figure for all of 1987, reports Venture Economics Inc.
00/wsj_0083:In addition, of course, some of the Japanese investments involved outright purchase of small U.S. firms. 
00/wsj_0083:Heightened Japanese interest in American small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large, highly visible U.S. corporations, such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. Only this week, it was announced that Mitsubishi Estate Co. had acquired a 51% stake in Rockefeller Group, which owns New York's prestigious Rockefeller Center. 
00/wsj_0083:While the small deals are far less conspicuous, they add to Japanese penetration of the U.S. market.
00/wsj_0083:Free State Glass Industries of Warrenton, Va., a small fabricator of architectural glass, was foundering under its original management.
00/wsj_0083:Last year, Mitsubishi International Corp., the New York-based arm of Mitsubishi Corp., bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with Ronald Bodner, a glass industry executive and Mitsubishi consultant. 
00/wsj_0083:Trading companies such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, C. Itoh & Co. and Nissho-Iwai Corp., which make many of the Japanese investments in small U.S. concerns, have no U.S. counterpart.
00/wsj_0083:These vertically integrated combines, some of which got their start in Japan's feudal period, deal globally in commodities, construction and manufacturing.
00/wsj_0083:"All the "sogo-shosha" are looking for new business," says Arthur Klauser, adviser to the president of Mitsui, U.S.A., using the Japanese term for the largest of the global trading houses. 
00/wsj_0083:Adds Takeshi Kondo, senior vice president of C. Itoh America Inc.: "We have a great interest in making investments, particularly in new ventures." 
00/wsj_0083:A host of electronics firms in California's Silicon Valley were financed with trading-company venture capital.
00/wsj_0083:Profit, at least in the short term, is usually a secondary goal. "Strategic objectives, not financial return, drive many of the deals," says a Venture Economics spokesman. 
00/wsj_0083:In investing on the basis of future transactions, a role often performed by merchant banks, trading companies can cut through the logjam that small-company owners often face with their local commercial banks. "It's the classic problem of the small businessman," says Malcolm Davies, managing director of Trading Alliance Corp. of New York. "People are queuing at the door to take his product but he doesn't have the working capital to make the thing and commercial banks are very unsympathetic.
00/wsj_0083:To the extent they can do this, they're quite content to get a return on investment of 1% to 2%." 
00/wsj_0083:Mr. Klauser says Mitsui has 75 U.S. subsidiaries in which it holds 35% interest or more and the trading company hopes to double the number of its U.S. affiliates in 1990.
00/wsj_0085:All she had to do was put $15,000 in a certificate of deposit, or qualify for a $10,000 personal line of credit. 
00/wsj_0085:So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days.
00/wsj_0085:Instead, they are trying to build customer loyalty by bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population. 
00/wsj_0085:"You're dead in the water if you aren't segmenting the market," says Anne Moore, president of Synergistics Research Corp., a bank consulting firm in Atlanta. 
00/wsj_0085:NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., recently introduced its Financial Connections Program aimed at young adults just starting careers.
00/wsj_0085:In September, Union Planters Corp. of Memphis, Tenn., launched The Edge account, a package designed for the "thirtysomething" crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees, and a full percentage point off on installment loans.
00/wsj_0085:Judie MacDonald, vice president of retail sales at Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville, Fla., says the company now targets sub-segments within the market by tailoring its popular Seniors Partners Program to various life styles. 
00/wsj_0085:In 1973, Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco launched the Gold Account, which included free checking, a credit card, safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a $3 monthly fee. 
00/wsj_0085:The concept begot a slew of copycats, but the banks stopped promoting the packages.
00/wsj_0085:They are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s.
00/wsj_0085:Where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account, it began offering money-market accounts, certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking, and staggering rates based on the size of deposits. 
00/wsj_0085:The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis and Chemical Banking Corp. of New York extend their market-share battles into small towns across the nation. "Today, a banker is worrying about local, regional and money-center {banks}, as well as thrifts and credit unions," says Ms. Moore at Synergistics Research. "So people who weren't even thinking about targeting 10 years ago are scrambling to define their customer base." 
00/wsj_0085:Packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place.
00/wsj_0085:For their troubles, the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate.
00/wsj_0085:Chemical Bank spent more than $50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line, several packages aimed at different segments, in 1986, according to Thomas Jacob, senior vice president of marketing. "It's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive, and make it pay," Mr. Jacob says. 
00/wsj_0086:The Chandler, Ariz., company said it will resubmit the registration to cover only the 2.3 million warrants, each exercisable for the purchase of one common share.
00/wsj_0087:Make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an American savings-and-loan association through the Foster Corporate Parents Plan. 
00/wsj_0087:But for an ailing savings-and-loan association -- teetering on insolvency -- it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise. 
00/wsj_0087:Your $15,000 will help keep a needy savings and loan solvent -- and out of the federal budget deficit. 
00/wsj_0087:At the same time, you'll give your Foster Savings Institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors -- for good. 
00/wsj_0087:Think about the good you can do for just $15,000 a month, about the cost of a mid-size Chevrolet or two semesters at a state university.
00/wsj_0088:Separately, John Phelan told a closed House subcommittee meeting in Washington that he would support Securities and Exchange Commission halts of program trading during market emergencies.
00/wsj_0088:The Chicago Merc said a new one-hour price limit would take effect in its Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures pit once S&P 500 futures fell 20 index points -- the equivalent of about a 150-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
00/wsj_0088:If the 20-point limit is triggered after 1:30 p.m. Chicago time, it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 3:15 p.m. 
00/wsj_0088:The exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on Friday Oct. 13, when the Dow Jones industrials plunged 190 points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well.
00/wsj_0088:Late that afternoon the S&P 500 stock-index futures contract fell a total of 30 index points, hitting a Merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session. 
00/wsj_0088:But when the contract reopened, the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30-point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices synchronized. 
00/wsj_0088:Several traders maintained that the Merc's 12-point circuit-breaker aggravated the market slide Oct. 13 by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 
00/wsj_0088:All of the changes require regulatory approval, which is expected shortly. 
00/wsj_0088:The Merc said that five-point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading.
00/wsj_0088:The limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10 minutes of trading. 
00/wsj_0088:A House aide suggested that Mr. Phelan was so "vague and mushy" that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could "come out feeling good." At one point, Mr. Phelan angered the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers. 
00/wsj_0088:That response annoyed Rep. Markey, House aides said, and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter. 
00/wsj_0088:Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing, most notably Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, who has been willing to let Mr. Markey carry the legislation in recent months. 
00/wsj_0089:The art of change-ringing is peculiar to the English, and, like most English peculiarities, unintelligible to the rest of the world. 
00/wsj_0089:ASLACTON, England -- Of all scenes that evoke rural England, this is one of the loveliest: An ancient stone church stands amid the fields, the sound of bells cascading from its tower, calling the faithful to evensong. 
00/wsj_0089:The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door, as members here always have.
00/wsj_0089:But there is also a discordant, modern note in Aslacton, though it can't be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening. 
00/wsj_0089:Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells, St. Michael once had its own "band" of ringers, who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service.
00/wsj_0089:They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia. 
00/wsj_0089:Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing.
00/wsj_0089:According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago, nearly a third of England's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them. 
00/wsj_0089:The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells, as do the carillons of continental Europe, is considered by the English to be childish, fit only for foreigners.
00/wsj_0089:Then, at a signal, the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking.
00/wsj_0089:Ringers memorize patterns of changes, known as "methods," which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters.
00/wsj_0089:A series of 5,000 or so changes is a "peal" and takes about three hours. 
00/wsj_0089:A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved.
00/wsj_0089:Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle, one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter's stance, each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber.
00/wsj_0089:No one speaks, and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves, muffled by the ceiling.
00/wsj_0089:In a well-known detective-story involving church bells, English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a "passion {that} finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection." Ringers, she added, are "filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed." 
00/wsj_0089:"Ringing does become a bit of an obsession," admits Stephanie Pattenden, master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England's best female ringers. 
00/wsj_0089:More often than not, ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry.
00/wsj_0089:With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling, strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services.
00/wsj_0089:Two years ago, the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone, vicar of Great Torrington, Devon, got so fed up with ringers who didn't attend service he sacked the entire band; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest. "They were a self-perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises," the Vicar Hummerstone says. 
00/wsj_0089:An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington, several of whom are members of the congregation.
00/wsj_0089:But there still aren't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells. 
00/wsj_0089:The vicar, W.D. Jones, refuses to talk about it, saying it would "reopen the wound." But C.J.B. Marshall, vicar of a nearby church, feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar. "So crunch, crunch, crunch, bang, bang, bang -- here come the ringers from above, making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer," he says. 
00/wsj_0089:Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue, since he is both a vicar and an active bell-ringer himself. "The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church," he says. "I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life." 
00/wsj_0089:The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, a sort of parliament of ringing groups, aims to improve relations with vicars, says John C. Baldwin, president.
00/wsj_0089:It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled, "The Bells in Your Care." Says Mr. Baldwin, "We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience." 
00/wsj_0089:Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem: lack of ringers.
00/wsj_0089:One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today, only 40,000 of them still ring.
00/wsj_0089:But the council's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful, says Mr. Baldwin. "Right now, we're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10," he adds. 
00/wsj_0089:One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field; more than a third of the ringers today are women.
00/wsj_0089:The oldest bell-ringing group in the country, the Ancient Society of College Youths, founded in 1637, remains male-only, a fact that's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain's most prestigious churches, St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. 
00/wsj_0089:This being Britain, no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit, but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to "The Ringing World," a weekly newspaper for ringers.
00/wsj_0089:One writer, signing his letter as "Red-blooded, balanced male," remarked on the "frequency of women fainting in peals," and suggested that they "settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings." 
00/wsj_0089:In the torrent of replies that followed, one woman ringer from Solihull observed that "the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired: badly dressed, decorated with acne and a large beer-belly, frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals." Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing, "I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry.
00/wsj_0090:Investors unsettled by the stock market's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks.
00/wsj_0090:That can be a trap for unwary investors, says Richard Bernstein, senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. Strong dividend growth, he says, is "the black widow of valuation" -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating. 
00/wsj_0090:Stephen Boesel, president of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund, explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time. "Invariably, those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments," he says. "And recessionary environments aren't hospitable to the stock market." 
00/wsj_0090:As a result, the market's dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards. 
00/wsj_0090:A drop below that 3% benchmark "has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued," says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price. 
00/wsj_0090:There's never been an exception," says Gerald W. Perritt, a Chicago investment adviser and money manager, based on a review of six decades of stock-market data. 
00/wsj_0090:The last time the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3% was in the summer of 1987.
00/wsj_0090:Still, some market analysts say the current 3.3% reading isn't as troublesome as it might have been in years past. "It's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner," says James H. Coxon, head of stock investments for Cigna Corp., the Philadelphia-based insurer. 
00/wsj_0090:In particular, Mr. Coxon says, businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically.
00/wsj_0090:Rather than increasing dividends, some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares, notes Steven G. Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
00/wsj_0090:He factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6%.
00/wsj_0090:That is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so, he says. 
00/wsj_0090:Common wisdom suggests a single-digit rate of growth, reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits. 
00/wsj_0090:PaineWebber Inc., for instance, is forecasting growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5% in 1990, down from an estimated 11% this year.
00/wsj_0090:In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment the firm expects in 1990 -- the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4% to a decline of 1% , according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger. 
00/wsj_0090:Dividend growth on the order of 12% is expected by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs.
00/wsj_0090:Those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures. 
00/wsj_0090:One indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends.
00/wsj_0090:A total of 139 companies raised dividends in October, basically unchanged from 138 a year ago, S&P said Wednesday.
00/wsj_0090:That followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace. 
00/wsj_0090:While the S&P tally doesn't measure the magnitude of dividend changes, a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year. 
00/wsj_0090:In any case, opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels.
00/wsj_0090:Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12% to 15% total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a "cash rate of return" of perhaps 7% or 8% if dividend growth is weak. 
00/wsj_0090:But Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price, who also expects 12% growth in dividends next year, doesn't think it will help the overall market all that much. "Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook, but I don't think it's a main consideration," he says.
00/wsj_0091:Your Oct. 13 page-one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bell's offer to it of his invention, because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph. 
00/wsj_0091:Bell's father-in-law, Gardner G. Hubbard, wealthy and well-connected, obtained financing to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston, which even had a subsidiary in New York called the Telephone Co. of New York.
00/wsj_0092:Stephen G. Jerritts, president and chief executive officer, said customers weren't willing to commit to an expensive NBI hardware systems because of the company's financial troubles.
00/wsj_0092:"We flat ran out of financing resources," Mr. Jerritts said. "We had to do something structurally and radically different." 
00/wsj_0092:As a result, he said NBI will focus on servicing its installed base of systems, trying to provide maintenance for other manufacturers and expanding its software business, using some of the applications it developed for its hardware.
00/wsj_0093:Mr. Nixon, the most prominent American to come to China since Beijing's bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in June, harped on international outrage over the massacre.
00/wsj_0093:One official newspaper, Legal Daily, even directly criticized Mr. Nixon, who is normally referred to here as an "old friend." The paper accused him of being a leading proponent of "peaceful evolution," a catch phrase to describe what China believes is the policy of Western countries to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere. 
00/wsj_0093:Instead, Mr. Nixon reminded his host, Chinese President Yang Shangkun, that Americans haven't forgiven China's leaders for the military assault of June 3-4 that killed hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of demonstrators. 
00/wsj_0093:"Many in the United States, including many friends of China, believe the crackdown was excessive and unjustified," Mr. Nixon told Mr. Yang, who was directly involved in ordering the attack. "The events of April through June damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had for the leaders of China." 
00/wsj_0093:Shortly afterwards, Mr. Bush imposed a series of anti-China sanctions, including suspension of most high-level talks, which could be codified in U.S. congressional legislation in the coming weeks. 
00/wsj_0093:And he plans to brief the president at the end of the week, U.S. sources said.
00/wsj_0093:According to an American member of the Nixon party, the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks with top-level Chinese officials.
00/wsj_0093:These included China's economic policies, human rights and the question of Mr. Fang.
00/wsj_0093:China pulled out of the program in July. 
00/wsj_0093:In his talks, the former president urged China's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas. "Ideas are going over borders, and there's no SDI ideological weapon that can shoot them down," he told a group of Americans at the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday. 
00/wsj_0093:There are no signs, however, of China's yielding on key issues.
00/wsj_0093:But the guards there retained their pistols, and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars.
00/wsj_0093:Several times, Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicked the trigger.
00/wsj_0094:Your Oct. 6 article "Japan's Financial Firms Lure Science Graduates" states, "Industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of jeopardizing Japan's economy by raising the salary stakes for new employees." The Japanese industrial companies should know better.
00/wsj_0094:Takuma Yamamoto, president of Fujitsu Ltd., believes "the `money worship' among young people . . . caused the problem." He is just passing the buck to young people.
00/wsj_0094:I visited a lot of major Japanese manufacturers, but I never felt I would want to be employed by any of them. 
00/wsj_0094:Many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising to improve their images, but they should realize that the most important thing is real change, not changing people's perceptions. 
00/wsj_0094:If the Japanese companies are seriously considering their survival, they could do at least three things to improve the situation: raise salaries higher than those of financial institutions; improve working conditions (better offices and more vacations, for example); accept and hire more labor from outside Japan. 
00/wsj_0095:In reference to your Oct. 9 page-one article "Barbara Bush Earns Even Higher Ratings Than the President," it is regrettable that you must continually define blacks by our negatives: "Among liberals, 60% have positive views of her, while 50% approve of the president's job performance.
00/wsj_0095:Among professionals, 76% have a favorable opinion of her, compared to 62% who approve of her husband's performance.
00/wsj_0095:While a quarter of black voters disapprove of Mr. Bush's handling of his job, only 15% have a negative view of his spouse." 
00/wsj_0095:The statistics imply that three-quarters of blacks approve of Mr. Bush's job performance and 85% of blacks approve of Mrs. Bush.
00/wsj_0095:Such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious, stereotyped perspective.
00/wsj_0096:The National Association of Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory organization for the over-the-counter securities markets, disciplined a number of firms and individuals for alleged violations of industry rules. 
00/wsj_0096:First Securities Group of California and a principal of the firm, Louis Fernando Vargas of Marina del Rey, Calif., were jointly fined $15,000 and expelled for alleged violations of reporting requirements on securities sales.
00/wsj_0096:Neither First Securities, of Beverly Hills, nor Mr. Vargas could be reached for comment.
00/wsj_0096:J.L. Henry & Co., Miami, and a principal of the firm, Henry I. Otero of Miami, were jointly fined $30,000 and expelled, for alleged improper use of a customer's funds, among other things.
00/wsj_0096:Biscayne Securities Corp., of Lauderhill, Fla., and a principal of the firm, Alvin Rosenblum of Plantation, Fla., were jointly fined $20,000 and given 10-day suspensions for allegedly selling securities at unfair prices.
00/wsj_0096:Triton Securities, of Danville, Calif., and a principal of the firm, Delwin George Chase, also of Danville, were jointly fined $10,000 and given 30-day suspensions as part of a settlement.
00/wsj_0096:While neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing, Triton and Mr. Chase consented to findings of violations in connection with limited-partnership sales.
00/wsj_0096:Officials of Triton couldn't be reached for comment.
00/wsj_0096:Crane & Co. Securities Inc., of Mount Clemens, Mich., and its president, Glenn R. Crane, of Sterling Heights, Mich., consented to a joint fine of $10,000.
00/wsj_0096:Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, they consented to findings of violations of escrow and record-keeping rules.
00/wsj_0096:First Commonwealth Securities Corp., of New Orleans, and its president, Kenneth J. Canepa, also of New Orleans, consented to a $10,000 fine.
00/wsj_0096:Weatherly Securities Corp., New York, and three of its principals -- Dell Eugene Keehn and William Northy Prater Jr., both of Mercer Island, Wash., and Thomas Albert McFall, of Red Bank, N.J. -- consented to a fine of $20,000.
00/wsj_0096:W.N. Whelen & Co., of Georgetown, Del., and its president, William N. Whelen Jr., also of Georgetown, were barred from transacting principal trades for 90 days and were jointly fined $15,000.
00/wsj_0096:Mr. Whelen denied the firm had sold securities at unfair prices and suggested that the examination practices of the NASD need improvement.
00/wsj_0096:The firm and the NASD differ over the meaning of markup and markdown, he added. 
00/wsj_0096:Except where noted, none of these people could be reached for comment or had any comment. 
00/wsj_0096:It was just a stupid mistake to get the license," he said, adding, "I'd just as soon not get into" details of the settlement. 
00/wsj_0097:Program traders are fond of predicting that if they are blocked in the U.S., they will simply emigrate to foreign stock markets.
00/wsj_0097:But in London and Tokyo, where computer-driven trading now plays a small but growing role, traders say a number of hurdles loom. 
00/wsj_0097:Government officials, especially in Japan, probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by players trying to shrug off the U.S. furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business.
00/wsj_0097:Japan is "very concerned" about the possible effects of program trading, a senior Japanese official said after the Oct. 13 stock plunge in New York. 
00/wsj_0097:And because of the time difference, the Japanese and the U.S. markets' trading hours don't overlap.
00/wsj_0097:It all adds up to a barrier to American-style index arbitrage, the most popular form of U.S. program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in New York and the price of a futures contract in Chicago based on those stocks. 
00/wsj_0097:About 11.6% of all program trading by New York Stock Exchange firms in September took place in foreign markets, according to Big Board data. 
00/wsj_0097:Japan's Finance Ministry already is scrutinizing institutional investors' activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading, said Makato Utsumi, vice minister for international finance. 
00/wsj_0097:Program trading has taken off in Japan since last year's introduction of home-market stock-index futures trading on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges.
00/wsj_0097:They haven't forgotten the leap in share prices last Dec. 7, when the first bout of foreign-led index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last half-hour of trading, startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing.
00/wsj_0097:Some U.S. firms, notably Salomon Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc., have reaped a hefty chunk of their Japanese earnings from index arbitrage, both for customers and for their own accounts. (Morgan Stanley last week joined a growing list of U.S. securities firms that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts.) 
00/wsj_0097:Both Deryck C. Maughan, who heads Salomon in Tokyo, and John S. Wadsworth, who heads Morgan Stanley there, ascribe a good part of their firms' success in Tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated, futures-related investment strategies to big institutional clients.
00/wsj_0097:London serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of U.S. stocks.
00/wsj_0097:In addition to the extra privacy of these trades, the transactions can often be less expensive to execute, because the parties don't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist's fee. 
00/wsj_0097:The average number of FT-SE option contracts traded on the London exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract's launch in 1984.
00/wsj_0097:This year, the average of daily contracts traded totaled 9,118, up from 4,645 a year earlier and from 917 in 1984. 
00/wsj_0097:But a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of index-options trading was only 15% of the size of the underlying equity market, exchange officials said.
00/wsj_0098:The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor.
00/wsj_0098:Advocates said the 90-cent-an-hour rise, to $4.25 an hour by April 1991, is too small for the working poor, while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs. 
00/wsj_0098:So both sides accepted the compromise, which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in 1977, raising the wage to $3.35 an hour from $2.65.
00/wsj_0098:While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average U.S. manufacturing wage, the level of $4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35% of average factory pay, Mr. Williams said. 
00/wsj_0098:But Rep. Marge Roukema (R., N.J.) instead praised the House's acceptance of a new youth "training" wage, a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought for many years.
00/wsj_0098:Adopting a training-wage policy means "getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage," Mrs. Roukema said. 
00/wsj_0098:Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage, but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force. 
00/wsj_0098:Labor unions and Democrats long fought the idea, but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence.
00/wsj_0098:The compromise sets the training wage at $3.35 an hour next April, and at $3.61 an hour, or 85% of the minimum wage, in April 1991. 
00/wsj_0098:Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days, without restriction, to workers with less than six months of job experience, and for another 90 days if the company uses a government-certified training program for the young workers.
00/wsj_0098:The White House previously insisted on an unrestricted six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job. 
00/wsj_0098:The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, still opposed to any mininum-wage increase, said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27% in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 "will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers." 
00/wsj_0099:Zenith Data Systems Corp., a subsidiary of Zenith Electronics Corp., received a $534 million Navy contract for software and services of microcomputers over an 84-month period. 
01/wsj_0100:Mr. Hahn, the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of Georgia-Pacific Corp. is leading the forest-product concern's unsolicited $3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. Nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder, a reaction Mr. Hahn hasn't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions, all of which were negotiated behind the scenes. 
01/wsj_0100:So far, Mr. Hahn is trying to entice Nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough. "We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction," he says. 
01/wsj_0100:But a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war, with all that implies.
01/wsj_0100:If a competitor enters the game, for example, Mr. Hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival. 
01/wsj_0100:Given that choice, associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers say the former university president -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold. 
01/wsj_0100:Says long-time associate Jerry Griffin, vice president, corporate development, at WTD Industries Inc.: "He isn't of the old school of winning at any cost." 
01/wsj_0100:The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa, for example, was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on, says Mr. Correll.
01/wsj_0100:Associates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute.
01/wsj_0100:Assuming that post at the age of 35, he managed by consensus, as is the rule in universities, says Warren H. Strother, a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn.
01/wsj_0100:In 1975, Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals; the move befuddled many in Georgia-Pacific who didn't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world. 
01/wsj_0100:The son of a physicist, Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates.
01/wsj_0100:Moving rapidly through school, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age 18, after spending only 2 1/2 years in college.
01/wsj_0100:He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
01/wsj_0100:Mr. Hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of Georgia-Pacific.
01/wsj_0100:At the same time, he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling, rather than materials for new-home construction.
01/wsj_0100:Mr. Hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best. 
01/wsj_0100:"The record of companies that have diversified isn't all that impressive," he says. 
01/wsj_0100:It would be a good match, Mr. Hahn and many analysts say, of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows.
01/wsj_0100:The resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $13 billion. 
01/wsj_0101:A House-Senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on $240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment. 
01/wsj_0101:For the Agency for International Development, appropriators approved $200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program, and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased by $40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package. 
01/wsj_0101:And though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant, recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively. 
01/wsj_0101:The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations, but the size of the increase is itself significant. 
01/wsj_0101:In a second area of common concern, the world environment, an additional $15 million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives, related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant. 
01/wsj_0101:The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments, running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market. 
01/wsj_0101:Panama was stripped of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime, but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21-month period ending Sept. 30, 1990.
01/wsj_0101:About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated, according to the industry, but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate. 
01/wsj_0101:The potential sales are nearly $9.3 million, and House Majority Whip William Gray (D., Pa.) began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to English-speaking countries of the Caribbean, such as Jamaica and Barbados.
01/wsj_0101:Rep. Jerry Lewis, a conservative Californian, added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia, and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines-backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye.
01/wsj_0101:Jamaica, wary of upsetting its Caribbean Basin allies, has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr. Gray, but the greater question is whether Mr. Inouye, who has strong ties to the sugar industry, is able to insert a claim by the Philippines. 
01/wsj_0102:EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation's old bridges need to be repaired or replaced.
01/wsj_0102:"The primary purpose of a railing is to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view," says Jack White, a planner with the Indiana Highway Department.
01/wsj_0102:Garret Boone, who teaches art at Earlham College, calls the new structure "just an ugly bridge" and one that blocks the view of a new park below. 
01/wsj_0102:Citizens in Peninsula, Ohio, upset over changes to a bridge, negotiated a deal: The bottom half of the railing will be type F, while the top half will have the old bridge's floral pattern. 
01/wsj_0102:PORTING POTABLES just got easier, or so claims Scypher Corp., the maker of the Cup-Tote. 
01/wsj_0102:The Chicago company's beverage carrier, meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast-food outlets, resembles the plastic loops used on six-packs of beer, only the loops hang from a web of strings.

01/wsj_0102:AN EXCHANGE of U.S. and Soviet designers promises change on both sides. 
01/wsj_0102:An exhibition of American design and architecture opened in September in Moscow and will travel to eight other Soviet cities.
01/wsj_0102:The show runs the gamut, from a blender to chairs to a model of the Citicorp building. 
01/wsj_0102:Dan Droz, leader of the Carnegie-Mellon group, sees benefits all around.
01/wsj_0102:Mr. Droz says the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose. "In Moscow, they kept asking us things like, `Why do you make 15 different corkscrews, when all you need is one good one? '" he says. "They got us thinking maybe we should be helping U.S. companies improve existing products rather than always developing new ones." 
01/wsj_0102:Besides, Eggers says, grain elevators are worth preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt. 
01/wsj_0102:A number of cities -- including Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators, Eggers says.
01/wsj_0103:The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of $6.1 million for alleged violations at the company's Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility.
01/wsj_0103:OSHA cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical, crane-safety, record-keeping and other requirements. 
01/wsj_0103:A second citation covering the company's Clairton, Pa., coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical-safety and other requirements, for which OSHA proposed $1.2 million in fines. 
01/wsj_0103:Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said, "The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health, and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards." 
01/wsj_0103:Gerard Scannell, the head of OSHA, said USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years, "yet have failed to take necessary action to counteract the hazards." 
01/wsj_0103:"Particularly flagrant," Mrs. Dole said, "are the company's numerous failures to properly record injuries at its Fairless works, in spite of the firm promise it had made in an earlier corporate-wide settlement agreement to correct such discrepancies." That settlement was in April 1987. 
01/wsj_0103:A USX spokesman said the company hadn't yet received any documents from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine. "Once we do, they will receive very serious evaluation," the spokesman said. "No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees." 
01/wsj_0103:He has promised stiffer fines, though the size of penalties sought by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year. 
01/wsj_0103:Before the USX case, OSHA's largest proposed fine for one employer was $4.3 million for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co., a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co., Cincinnati.
01/wsj_0105:Your Oct. 6 editorial "The Ill Homeless" referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
01/wsj_0105:Your comments implied we had discovered that the "principal cause" of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population.
01/wsj_0105:The "causes" of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case. 
01/wsj_0105:In quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism.
01/wsj_0105:You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse.
01/wsj_0105:They suffered from malnutrition, chest diseases, cardiovascular disorders, skin problems, infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape.
01/wsj_0105:Homeless people not only lack safety, privacy and shelter, they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition, cleanliness and basic health care.
01/wsj_0105:In a recent report, the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness, others may be a consequence of it, and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter.
01/wsj_0105:This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess, an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research. 
01/wsj_0105:Department of Psychiatry 
01/wsj_0105:School of Medicine 
01/wsj_0105:James Wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems, with the common thread of poverty.
01/wsj_0105:The study shows that nearly 40% of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25% of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug, alcohol and mental problems. 
01/wsj_0105:According to Dr. Wright, homelessness is "simultaneously a housing problem, an employment problem, a demographic problem, a problem of social disaffiliation, a mental health problem, a family violence problem, a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending, a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family, and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level." 
01/wsj_0105:To quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop-in center for the homeless in New York: "If you're homeless, you don't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered.
01/wsj_0105:After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation, you're scarcely in touch with reality any more; without psychiatric treatment, you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again." 
01/wsj_0105:Some of the homeless, obviously, had pre-existing mental illness or addiction.
01/wsj_0105:But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim, brutal world of our city streets.
01/wsj_0105:Once there, what ways of escape are open to them other than drink, drugs or insanity? 
01/wsj_0105:You dismiss as "sentimental" the view that the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by 77% might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the Reagan-Bush years.
01/wsj_0105:There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic: namely, that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness.
01/wsj_0105:Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless, you chose to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that "know a good thing when they see it," and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive.
01/wsj_0105:Choose 203 business executives, including, perhaps, someone from your own staff, and put them out on the streets, to be deprived for one month of their homes, families and income.
01/wsj_0105:I would predict that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their "normal" phobias, anxieties, depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically. 
01/wsj_0106:ROGERS COMMUNICATIONS Inc. said it plans to raise 175 million to 180 million Canadian dollars (US$148.9 million to $153.3 million) through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares.
01/wsj_0106:He declined to discuss other terms of the issue. 
01/wsj_0107:The Bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry, but the 300-113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto. 
01/wsj_0107:Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline, it is aimed at giving the Transportation Department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt. "The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier's ability to compete," Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, (R., Ark.) said. 
01/wsj_0107:The bill, as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15% or more of the stock in an airline.
01/wsj_0107:The department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished; it would be put into foreign control; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets -- unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit. 
01/wsj_0107:The House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.) that would, in addition to the previous criteria, also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier's employees, or their wages or benefits. 
01/wsj_0107:On Tuesday, the House approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 
01/wsj_0108:You now may drop by the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week.
01/wsj_0108:You can do all this even if you're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress. 
01/wsj_0108:And my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts. 
01/wsj_0108:Until the other day, you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world.
01/wsj_0108:Government press releases, speeches, briefings, tours of military facilities, publications are all propaganda of sorts.
01/wsj_0108:Propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint, and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue. 
01/wsj_0108:The restrictions on viewing and dissemination of Voice material were especially absurd: An agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform. 
01/wsj_0108:Assuming it wasn't one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door, I'll review the facts. 
01/wsj_0108:The Voice of America is a government agency that broadcasts news and views -- some might say propaganda -- in 43 languages to 130 million listeners around the world.
01/wsj_0108:But a 1948 law barred the "dissemination" of that material in the U.S.
01/wsj_0108:The law let scholars, reporters and researchers read texts of VOA material, only at VOA headquarters in Washington, but it barred them from copying texts.
01/wsj_0108:And, of course, there's that word "dissemination." 
01/wsj_0108:That sounded a lot like censorship, so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere, I sued. 
01/wsj_0108:A couple of weeks ago, I lost the case in federal district court in Des Moines.
01/wsj_0108:But I -- I like to think of it in terms of we, all of us -- won the point. 
01/wsj_0108:-- The USIA said that, on reflection, of course I could print anything I could get my hands on.
01/wsj_0108:The word dissemination, it decided, referred only to itself. "The USIA officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the USIA to disseminate agency program materials in the United States," my lawyer, the scholarly Mark McCormick of Des Moines, said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost.
01/wsj_0108:-- The USIA said that, on reflection, anyone could view the VOA materials, not just the reporters, scholars, researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute. "The USIA publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials, notwithstanding the statutory designations, because the USIA has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials," Mr. McCormick noted. 
01/wsj_0108:-- And the USIA said that all of us could take extensive notes. "The agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and, while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes, no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken," Mr. McCormick reported. 
01/wsj_0108:But the court disagreed. "The First Amendment proscribes the government from passing laws abridging the right to free speech," Judge Donald O'Brien ruled. "The First Amendment does not prescribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press." 
01/wsj_0108:So now the situation is this: You have a right to read Voice of America scripts if you don't mind traveling to Washington every week or so and visiting the Voice office during business hours.
01/wsj_0108:But neither of us can copy the material on a Xerox machine or have it sent to us. 
01/wsj_0108:Section 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 says Voice material shall be available to certain of us (but now, thanks to the USIA's new position, all of us) "for examination only." If those words weren't there, the nice people at the Voice would be able to send you the information or, at the very least, let you photocopy it. 
01/wsj_0108:"You have . . . raised important questions which ought to be answered: What does USIA say about America abroad; how do we say it; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions?" a man wrote me a couple of years ago.
01/wsj_0108:At the time, he was director of the

01/wsj_0109:R. Gordon McGovern was forced out as Campbell Soup Co. 's president and chief executive officer, the strongest evidence yet of the power that Dorrance family members intend to wield in reshaping the troubled food company. 
01/wsj_0109:Herbert M. Baum, the 53-year-old president of the company's Campbell U.S.A. unit, and Edwin L. Harper, 47, the chief financial officer, will run Campbell as a team, dividing responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named.
01/wsj_0109:"The profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better," said John McMillin, a food industry analyst for Prudential-Bache in New York.
01/wsj_0109:Some of the surge in the stock's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation, which has contributed to volatility of Campbell shares in recent months. 
01/wsj_0109:Campbell's international businesses, particularly in the U.K. and Italy, appear to be at the heart of its problems.
01/wsj_0109:Growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in U.S. units. 
01/wsj_0109:Mr. Harper, a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined Campbell in 1986, will take charge of all overseas operations as well as Pepperidge. 
01/wsj_0109:Mr. McGovern, 63, had been under intense pressure from the board to boost Campbell's mediocre performance to the level of other food companies.
01/wsj_0109:The board is dominated by the heirs of the late John T. Dorrance Jr., who controlled about 58% of Campbell's stock when he died in April.
01/wsj_0109:Campbell officials said Mr. McGovern wasn't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure.
01/wsj_0109:But people familiar with the agenda of the board's meeting last week in London said Mr. McGovern was fired. 
01/wsj_0109:Mr. McGovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of 65 in October 1991, "unless I get fired." Campbell said Mr. McGovern had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting, scheduled for Nov. 17. 
01/wsj_0109:For fiscal 1989, Mr. McGovern received a salary of $877,663.
01/wsj_0109:He owns about 45,000 shares of Campbell stock and has options to buy more than 100,000 additional shares.
01/wsj_0109:He will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $244,000 with certain other fringe benefits. 
01/wsj_0109:Mr. Harper expressed confidence that he and Mr. Baum can convince the board of their worthiness to run the company. "We look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team," he said.
01/wsj_0109:Mr. Baum said the two have orders to "focus on bottom-line profits" and to "take a hard look at our businesses -- what is good, what is not so good." Analysts generally applaud the performance of Campbell U.S.A., the company's largest division, which posted 6% unit sales growth and a 15% improvement in operating profit for fiscal 1989. "The way that we've been managing Campbell U.S.A. can hopefully spread to other areas of the company," Mr. Baum said.

01/wsj_0111:Robert L. Bernstein, chairman and president of Random House Inc., announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for 23 years. 
01/wsj_0111:Abrupt departures aren't unheard of within the Newhouse empire. 
01/wsj_0111:In an interview, Mr. Bernstein said his departure "evolved out of discussions with Si Newhouse and that's the decision I reached." He declined to elaborate, other than to say, "It just seemed the right thing to do at this minute.
01/wsj_0111:Mr. Newhouse, meanwhile, insisted that he isn't unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House, the largest trade publishing house in the U.S.
01/wsj_0111:The company said the publisher's annual sales volume increased to $800 million from $40 million during Mr. Bernstein's tenure. "Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly," said Mr. Newhouse. "The company is doing well, it's stable, it's got good people.
01/wsj_0111:Publishing officials believe that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years, some of the bigger ones haven't been absorbed so easily.
01/wsj_0111:Mr. Bernstein, who succeeded Bennett Cerf, has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded in 1925.
01/wsj_0111:Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house.
01/wsj_0111:Possible candidates include Susan Petersen, president of Ballantine/Del Rey/ Fawcett, Random House's huge and successful paperback division.
01/wsj_0111:Some say Anthony Cheetham, head of a recently acquired British company, Century Hutchinson, could be chosen. 
01/wsj_0111:Not included on the most-likely-successor list are Joni Evans, recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House, and Sonny Mehta, president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit.
01/wsj_0111:Mr. Bernstein, a tall, energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive, has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues. 
01/wsj_0112:It signals Congress's attempt, under the pretext of guarding the public purse, to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution. 
01/wsj_0112:This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional.
01/wsj_0112:The appropriations clause states that "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. . . ." The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding.
01/wsj_0112:As partisans of congressional power understand, a "power of the purse" so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers.
01/wsj_0112:It is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution. 
01/wsj_0112:The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, according to Madison's notes.
01/wsj_0112:Moreover, the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation.
01/wsj_0112:It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause (technically a limitation on legislative power) could be read as placing the president on Congress's short leash, making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress. 
01/wsj_0112:As it went to the conference panel now deliberating, the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public's money.
01/wsj_0112:During the coming weeks, President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or, alternatively, to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II, and thus void and severable. 
01/wsj_0112:The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II. Article II places on the president the duty to nominate, "and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate" appoint, ambassadors, judges, and other officers of the U.S.
01/wsj_0112:It also empowers the president to make recess appointments, without Senate approval: "The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session." 
01/wsj_0112:Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides: "No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person." Thus, with one brief passage in an appropriations bill, Congress repeals the president's power to make recess appointments under Article II. 
01/wsj_0112:Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing.
01/wsj_0112:The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person's salary.
01/wsj_0112:The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of "muzzling" provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution.
01/wsj_0112:Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress, but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations. 
01/wsj_0112:Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny.
01/wsj_0112:Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill: "None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement, administer, or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States." 
01/wsj_0112:This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president's execution of the law, since a one-house resolution could be said to be "duly adopted" even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto.
01/wsj_0112:President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives.
01/wsj_0112:If President Bush fails to do so in his first year, he will invite Congress, for the remainder of his presidency, to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes.
01/wsj_0112:If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded, the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision, declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable.
01/wsj_0112:The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto. 
01/wsj_0112:Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto.
01/wsj_0112:As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending, the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives.
01/wsj_0112:The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability.
01/wsj_0112:One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president, by exerting a power of excision, to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers. 
01/wsj_0112:There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills.
01/wsj_0112:In that case, he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive. 
01/wsj_0112:Moreover, the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice. 
01/wsj_0112:If he does not, he will help realize Madison's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature "everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex." 
01/wsj_0112:His longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the Duke Law Journal later this year. 
01/wsj_0113:Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record, net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of $59.9 billion last year. 
01/wsj_0113:Most of those states set farm income records. 
01/wsj_0113:What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had "mortgaged" to the government under price-support loan programs.
01/wsj_0113:In less parched areas, meanwhile, farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices. 
01/wsj_0113:To the surprise of some analysts, net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit states, including Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska and the Dakotas.
01/wsj_0113:Last year's record net cash income confirms the farm sector's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s.
01/wsj_0113:It also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year. 
01/wsj_0113:"All of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture," Mr. Collins said. 
01/wsj_0113:Despite federal disaster relief, the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers, according to the department.
01/wsj_0113:At the same time, an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn, soybeans and other commodities, causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets. 
01/wsj_0114:After years of struggling, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner will publish its last edition today, shut down by its parent, Hearst Corp., following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper. 
01/wsj_0114:The demise of the 238,000-circulation Herald, once the nation's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding 700,000, turns the country's second-largest city into a one-newspaper town, at least in some senses.
01/wsj_0114:The Los Angeles Times, with a circulation of more than 1.1 million, dominates the region.
01/wsj_0114:An attempted buy-out led by John J. McCabe, chief operating officer, never materialized, and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as "tire-kickers and lookee-loos" had filed through since.
01/wsj_0114:The death of the Herald, a newsstand paper in a freeway town, was perhaps inevitable.
01/wsj_0114:Los Angeles is a sprawling, balkanized newspaper market, and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth Times, then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies.
01/wsj_0114:The Herald joins the Baltimore News-American, which folded, and the Boston Herald-American, which was sold, as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s.
01/wsj_0114:Many felt Hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did, if marginally, because of its place in family history.
01/wsj_0114:Analysts said the Herald's demise doesn't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry. "The Herald was a survivor from a bygone age," said J. Kendrick Noble, a media analyst with PaineWebber Inc. "Actually, the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end, and the industry looks pretty healthy." 
01/wsj_0114:Robert J. Danzig, vice president and general manager of Hearst Newspapers, stood up in the paper's newsroom yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would fold, putting more than 730 full-time employees out of work. 
01/wsj_0114:Hours after the announcement, representatives of the Orange County Register were in a bar across the street recruiting. 
01/wsj_0114:"I'm doing the main story, and I'm already two beers drunk," said reporter Andy Furillo, whom the Times hired away several years ago but who returned to the Herald out of preference.
01/wsj_0115:Olympia Broadcasting Corp. said it didn't make a $1.64 million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $23.4 million of senior subordinated debentures. 
01/wsj_0115:It said it needs to make the payment by Dec. 1 to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt. 
01/wsj_0116:American Express Co. and General Motors Corp. 's beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting Buick's sales while encouraging broader use of the American Express card. 
01/wsj_0116:The companies are giving four-day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card.
01/wsj_0116:For American Express, the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales, where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business.
01/wsj_0116:Phillip Riese, an American Express executive vice president, says the promotion with Buick is his company's first with an auto maker, but "hopefully {will be} the first of many" in the company's effort to promote its green card as "the total car-care card." To that end, American Express has been signing up gasoline companies, car repair shops, tire companies and car dealers to accept the card. 
01/wsj_0116:Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card, but few card holders realize this, Mr. Riese says. 
01/wsj_0116:Until now, however, buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. couldn't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates, says a spokesman for the GM finance arm.
01/wsj_0116:When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases, Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars, the spokeswoman says. 
01/wsj_0116:Some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC.
01/wsj_0116:A spokesman for Visa International's U.S. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards, but doesn't have plans for a tie-in similar to the American Express-Buick link. 
01/wsj_0116:In lieu of the vacation, buyers can choose among several prizes, including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder.
01/wsj_0116:A few years ago, the company offered two round-trip tickets on Trans World Airlines to buyers of its Riviera luxury car.
01/wsj_0117:The United Kingdom High Court declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks. 
01/wsj_0117:The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions.
01/wsj_0117:In response to the ruling, gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session.
01/wsj_0117:Gilts, or British government bonds, which also fell sharply initially, retraced some of the losses to end about 3/8 point lower. 
01/wsj_0117:The council, which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over #6 billion ($9.5 billion), lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals.
01/wsj_0117:At one point, Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10% of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings. 
01/wsj_0117:In most of the British transactions, the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks, which would make fixed-rate payments.
01/wsj_0117:The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell, district auditor for Hammersmith, who argued that local councils aren't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capital-markets activities.
01/wsj_0117:"While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith, it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature," a solicitor representing one of the banks said. 
01/wsj_0117:If the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal, it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways, some market sources said.
01/wsj_0118:In the aftermath of the stock market's gut-wrenching 190-point drop on Oct. 13, Kidder, Peabody & Co. 's 1,400 stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and letter-writing campaign aimed at quashing the country's second-largest program trader. 
01/wsj_0118:The target of their wrath?
01/wsj_0118:Since October's minicrash, Wall Street has been shaken by an explosion of resentment against program trading, the computer-driven, lightning-fast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes. 
01/wsj_0118:Program trading itself, according to many academics who have studied it, is merely caught in the middle of this battle, unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace.
01/wsj_0118:On one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms, their pension fund clients with immense pools of money, and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago futures exchanges.
01/wsj_0118:These are the main proponents of program trading. 
01/wsj_0118:Defending their ramparts are Wall Street's Old Guard -- the traditional, stock-picking money managers, tens of thousands of stock brokers, the New York Stock Exchange's listed companies and the clannish floor traders, known as specialists, who make markets in their stocks. 
01/wsj_0118:The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a major futures marketplace, yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market, and the Big Board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading. 
01/wsj_0118:Stung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot, almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage, a common form of program trading, for their own accounts in the past few days.
01/wsj_0118:Big Board stock specialists, in a bold palace revolt, began shortly after Oct. 13 to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the Big Board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading. 
01/wsj_0118:Charles Wohlstetter, the chairman of Contel Corp. who is rallying other CEOs to the anti-program trading cause, says he has received "countless" letters offering support. "They said universally, without a single exception: Don't even compromise.
01/wsj_0118:Program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country, and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them.
01/wsj_0118:What's more, the last time major Wall Street firms said they were getting out of program trading -- in the aftermath of the 1987 crash -- they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it. 
01/wsj_0118:Even some members of the Old Guard, despite their current advantage, seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the New Guard.
01/wsj_0118:Last week, Robert M. Bradley, one of the Big Board's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders' organization, surrendered.
01/wsj_0118:At Kidder, a unit of General Electric Co., and other big brokerage firms, stockbrokers battle their own firm's program traders a few floors away.
01/wsj_0118:But the Big Board's leadership -- over the specialists' protests -- two weeks ago began trading a new stock "basket" product designed to facilitate program trading. "A lot of people would like to go back to 1970," before program trading, Mr. Phelan said this week. "I would like to go back to 1970.
01/wsj_0118:They say greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation's free-enterprise system, turning the stock market into a big gambling den, with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor. "The public didn't come to the market to play a game; they can go to Off-Track Betting for that," says A. Brean Murray, chairman of Brean Murray, Foster Securities, a traditional money management firm. 
01/wsj_0118:The program traders, on the other hand, portray old-fashioned stock pickers as the Neanderthals of the industry.
01/wsj_0118:Critics like Mr. Murray "are looking for witches, and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman," says J. Thomas Allen, president of Advanced Investment Management Inc., a Pittsburgh firm that runs a $200 million fund that uses index arbitrage. "Just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to beg the regulators for protection." 
01/wsj_0118:For all the furor, there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage, the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading.
01/wsj_0118:Like other forms of arbitrage, it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case, a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago futures markets. 
01/wsj_0118:When it occurs, the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks (such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index) in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market; they lock in the difference in price as profit. 
01/wsj_0118:Such program trades, which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock, occur in a matter of seconds.
01/wsj_0118:A program trade of $5 million of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of $25,000.
01/wsj_0118:To keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives, traders must seize every opportunity their computers find. 
01/wsj_0118:But many experts and traders say that program trading isn't the main reason for stock-market gyrations. "I have not seen one iota of evidence" to support restrictions on program trading, says a Vanderbilt University finance professor, Hans Stoll, an authority on the subject.
01/wsj_0118:The Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders, but by news of the unraveling of the $6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp. Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares, takeover-stock speculators, or risk arbitragers, dumped every blue-chip stock they had.
01/wsj_0118:Susan Del Signore, head trader at Travelers Investment Management Co., says critics are ignoring "the role the {takeover stock} speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility." Many arbs are "overleveraged," she says, and they "have to sell when things look like they fall apart." 
01/wsj_0118:Like virtually everything on Wall Street, the program-trading battle is over money, and the traditionalists have been losing out on bundles of it to the New Guard in recent years.
01/wsj_0118:Yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with, much less beat, the returns of standard benchmarks like the S&P 
01/wsj_0118:Today, about $200 billion, or 20% of all pension-fund stock investments, is held by index funds. 
01/wsj_0118:The new Wall Street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 Big Board stock-specialist firms.
01/wsj_0118:These small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of 30% to 40% a year on their capital, by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks.
01/wsj_0118:The son of a specialist and once one himself, Mr. Phelan has nonetheless been striving -- with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much -- to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets. 
01/wsj_0118:Meanwhile, specialists' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility. "When the sell programs hit, you can hear the order printers start to go" on the Big Board trading floor, says one specialist there. "The buyers walk away, and the specialist is left alone" as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks, he contends. 
01/wsj_0118:They are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market's swings since then. "Small investors are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them, and these wide swings are scaring them to death," says Raymond A. Mason, chairman of regional broker Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore.
01/wsj_0118:Corporate executives resent that their company's stock has been transformed into a nameless piece of a stock-index basket.
01/wsj_0118:Index traders who buy all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 often don't even know what the companies they own actually do, complains Andrew Sigler, chairman of Champion International Corp. "Do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs?
01/wsj_0118:By this September, program traders were doing a record 13.8% of the Big Board's average daily trading volume.
01/wsj_0118:Stock futures trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their 20s and 30s.
01/wsj_0118:Now, on a good day, Chicago's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the Big Board trades in stock. 
01/wsj_0118:"You're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks," says Vanderbilt's Prof.
01/wsj_0118:Short of a total ban, some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms, which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors don't. 
01/wsj_0118:One such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement -- or the "good-faith" payment of cash needed to trade them -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks.
01/wsj_0118:Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell, they say. 
01/wsj_0118:Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an "uptick rule"a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices, namely short sellers.
01/wsj_0118:The Big Board's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price. 
01/wsj_0118:A reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably.
01/wsj_0118:Program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the "pricing efficiency" of the futures and stock markets. 
01/wsj_0118:Thus the band-wagon psychology of recent days picks up new impetus. 
01/wsj_0118:Index arbitrage is a common form of program trading.
01/wsj_0118:As usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept: Two separate markets in different locations, trading basically the same widgets, can't trade them for long at prices that are widely different.
01/wsj_0118:If the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index, he is likely to remain fully invested at all times. (Few, if any, index-fund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more than 100% exposure to stocks, and equally few will want to own less than a 100% position should stocks rise.) 
01/wsj_0118:By constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget, index-arbitrage traders hope to add between 1% and 3% to the annual return of the S&P 500.
01/wsj_0118:The fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue. 
01/wsj_0118:The New York Stock Exchange's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares. 
01/wsj_0118:So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget, how did "program trading" evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers?
01/wsj_0118:But many of these reforms are unneeded, even harmful. 
01/wsj_0118:The start of the whole process is the key-someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move. 
01/wsj_0118:Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in Chicago instead of New York?
01/wsj_0118:Perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade.
01/wsj_0118:Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage, but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity.
01/wsj_0118:Eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising, creating more volatility instead of less.
01/wsj_0118:The speed of his transaction isn't to be feared either, because faster and cleaner execution is desirable, not loathsome.
01/wsj_0118:If slowing things down could reduce volatility, stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future. 
01/wsj_0118:We must be very cautious about labeling investors as "long-term" or "short-term." Policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board's door saying: "Buyers welcome, sellers please go away!" The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive, and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term.
01/wsj_0118:In point of fact, volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today.
01/wsj_0118:Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile, usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change (1973-75, 1937-40, and 1928-33 for example).
01/wsj_0118:Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks, instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins? 
01/wsj_0118:Some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled "program-trading volatility" could be far worse than the perceived problem.
01/wsj_0118:This argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading -- not because of its merits, but because of the firms championing the cause.
01/wsj_0118:The loudest of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors.
01/wsj_0118:Yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studiously devouring press clippings on each company he follows. 
01/wsj_0118:Almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy, and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences. 
01/wsj_0118:The sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue stellar performers first, while leaving institutions to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter.
01/wsj_0119:The funding mechanism, which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by President Bush, would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. 
01/wsj_0119:As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending, Congress cut by $30 million the Bush administration's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1.
01/wsj_0119:Under measures approved by both houses of Congress, the administration's request for $47 million for the Antitrust Division would be cut $15 million.
01/wsj_0119:The FTC budget request of $70 million, about $34 million of which would go for antitrust enforcement, would also be cut by $15 million.
01/wsj_0119:Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that, based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year, the fees will yield at least $40 million this fiscal year, or $10 million more than the budget cuts. "When you do that, there is not a cut, but there is in fact a program increase of $5 million" each for the FTC and the Justice Department, Rep. Neal Smith (D., Iowa) said during House debate. 
01/wsj_0119:But Rep. Don Edwards (D., Calif.) responded that a recession could stifle merger activity, reducing the amount of fees collected.
01/wsj_0119:The antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut more than 40% in the Reagan administration, and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period. "Today is not the time to signal that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen," Mr. Edwards argued. 
01/wsj_0119:Any money in excess of $40 million collected from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the Treasury at large. 
01/wsj_0120:But the 1989 fall total of 80, while well below 1988 activity, shows "a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives," says Patrick McGuigan, editor of Family, Law and Democracy Report.
01/wsj_0120:In California, two petition drives for next year's election are "essentially finished," says David Schmidt, author of "Citizen Lawmakers." Mr. McGuigan cites three completed efforts in Oklahoma.
01/wsj_0120:Taking a cue from California, more politicians will launch their campaigns by backing initiatives, says David Magleby of Brigham Young University. 
01/wsj_0120:At Christie's, a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz's "Equivalents" series sold for $396,000, a single-lot record.
01/wsj_0120:In part, prices reflect development of a market structure based on such variables as the number of prints.
01/wsj_0120:This information used to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal, says Beth Gates-Warren of Sotheby's. "There is finally some sort of sense in the market," she says. 
01/wsj_0120:Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers, giving greater market stability, says Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector. "When I see prints going into the hands of institutions, I know they aren't going to come back on the market." Most in demand: classic photographs by masters such as Stieglitz and Man Ray.
01/wsj_0120:But much contemporary work is also fetching "a great deal of money," says Miles Barth of the International Center of Photography. 
01/wsj_0120:DIALING 900 brings callers a growing number of services. 
01/wsj_0120:Currently a $300 million-a-year business, 900 telephone service is expected to hit $500 million next year and near $2 billion by 1992 as uses for the service continue to expand, says Joel Gross of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.
01/wsj_0120:"I'm starting to see more business transactions," says Andrea West of American Telephone & Telegraph Co., noting growing interest in use of 900 service for stock sales, software tutorials and even service contracts.
01/wsj_0120:Much of the 800 service will "migrate to 900," predicts Jack Lawless, general manager of US Sprint's 900 product.

01/wsj_0120:MEDICINE TRANSPLANT: Growth of Japanese trade and travel prompts Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, to set up a bilingual medical practice.
01/wsj_0120:Concerned about shrinking landfills and the safety of chemicals used in super-absorbent disposables, parents are returning to the cloth diaper.
01/wsj_0120:Tiny Tots Inc., Campbell, Calif., says business is up 35% in the past year. "We're gaining 1,200 new customers each week," says Jack Mogavero of General Health Care Corp., Piscataway, N.J.
01/wsj_0120:The National Association of Diaper Services, Philadelphia, says that since January it has gotten more than 672 inquiries from people interested in starting diaper services.
01/wsj_0120:BRIEFS: Only 57.6% of New Yorkers watch the local news, the lowest viewership in the country, says a new study by Impact Resources Inc., Columbus, Ohio. . . . FreudToy, a pillow bearing the likeness of Sigmund Freud, is marketed as a $24.95 tool for do-it-yourself analysis. 
01/wsj_0121:Program trading is "a racket," complains Edward Egnuss, a White Plains, N.Y., investor and electronics sales executive, "and it's not to the benefit of the small investor, that's for sure." But although he thinks that it is hurting him, he doubts it could be stopped. 
01/wsj_0121:Mr. Egnuss's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters across the country.
01/wsj_0121:He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades, that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading. 
01/wsj_0121:But he blames program trading for only some of the market's volatility.
01/wsj_0121:Or, as Dorothy Arighi, an interior decorator in Arnold, Calif., puts it: "All kinds of funny things spook the market these days." But she believes that "program trading creates deviant swings.
01/wsj_0121:At the Charles Schwab & Co. office in Atlanta's Buckhead district, a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program trading.
01/wsj_0121:Similarly, Rick Wamre, a 31-year-old asset manager for a Dallas real-estate firm, would like to see program trading disappear because "I can't see that it does anything for the market or the country." Yet he isn't in favor of new legislation. "I think we've got enough securities laws," he says. "I'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit." 
01/wsj_0121:And surprising numbers of small investors seem to be adapting to greater stock market volatility and say they can live with program trading. 
01/wsj_0121:You can't hold back technology." And the practice shouldn't be stopped, he says, because "even big players aren't immune to the rigors of program trading." 
01/wsj_0121:The market is just becoming more efficient." Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets, he says.
01/wsj_0121:Jim Enzor of Atlanta defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge. "If we have a real bad day, the program would say, `Buy, '" he explains. "If you could get the rhythm of the program trading, you could take advantage of it." 
01/wsj_0121:Now, he plans to sell all his stocks by the first quarter of 1990. 
01/wsj_0121:In October, before the market dropped, Mrs. Arighi of Arnold, Calif., moved to sell the "speculative stocks" in her family trust "so we will be able to withstand all this flim-flammery" caused by program trading.
01/wsj_0121:Mrs. Gorman took advantage of low prices after the 1987 crash to buy stocks and has hunted for other bargains since the Oct. 13 plunge. 
01/wsj_0122:Young's Market Co., a wholesaler of spirits, wines and other goods, said it will merge with a new corporation formed by the Underwood family, which controls Young's. 
01/wsj_0122:Under terms of the agreement, shareholders other than the Underwoods will receive $3,500 a share at closing, which is expected in December.
01/wsj_0122:The Underwood family said that holders of more than a majority of the stock of the company have approved the transaction by written consent. 
01/wsj_0123:Researchers at American Telephone & Telegraph Co. 's Bell Laboratories reported they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100, moving the materials closer to commercial use. 
01/wsj_0123:The scientists said they created small changes in the crystal-lattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field.
01/wsj_0123:Their report appears in today's issue of the journal Nature. 
01/wsj_0123:Scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors, but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry. 
01/wsj_0123:A family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation -- but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised. 
01/wsj_0123:The AT&T advance shows how one aspect of the current-carrying problem can be overcome.
01/wsj_0123:But "it won't lead to imminent use" of new superconductors, cautioned Robert B. van Dover, one of the AT&T researchers.
01/wsj_0123:He added that the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals.
01/wsj_0123:Still, scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding, because it demonstrates how to overcome the "flux pinning" problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors' potential.
01/wsj_0123:The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals, limiting their current-carrying capacity.
01/wsj_0123:The combined processes may significantly raise the current-carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples. 
01/wsj_0124:William C. Walbrecher Jr., an executive at San Francisco-based 1st Nationwide Bank, was named president and chief executive officer of Citadel Holding Corp. and its principal operating unit, Fidelity Federal Bank. 
01/wsj_0124:Separately, Citadel posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.3 million, or 68 cents a share, versus net income of $5.3 million, or $1.61 a share, a year earlier. 
01/wsj_0124:The latest results include some unusual write-downs, which had an after-tax impact of $4.9 million.

01/wsj_0125:Maryland Community Development Administration, Department of Housing and Community Development -- $80.8 million of single-family program bonds, 1989 fourth and fifth series, tentatively priced by a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group to yield from 6.25% in 1992 for fourth series bonds to 7.74% in 2029 for fifth series bonds.
01/wsj_0125:There is $30.9 million of fourth series bonds, the interest on which is not subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.
01/wsj_0125:There is $49.9 million of fifth series bonds, which are subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.
01/wsj_0125:Heiwado Co. (Japan) -- $100 million of Eurobonds due Nov. 16, 1993, with equity-purchase warrants, indicating a 3 7/8% coupon at par, via Daiwa Europe Ltd.
01/wsj_0125:Each $5,000 bond carries one warrant, exercisable from Nov. 30, 1989, through Nov. 2, 1993, to buy shares at an expected premium of 2 1/2% to the closing price when terms are fixed Tuesday.
01/wsj_0125:Svenska Intecknings Garanti Aktiebolaget (Sweden) -- 20 billion yen of 6% Eurobonds due Nov. 21, 1994, priced at 101 3/4 to yield 6.03% less full fees, via Mitsui Finance International.

01/wsj_0126:He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week's ballot to help build a replacement for Candlestick Park.
01/wsj_0126:It's fueled by the increasing profitability of major-league teams.
01/wsj_0126:Something like one-third of the nation's 60 largest cities are thinking about new stadiums, ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg. 
01/wsj_0126:Stadiums tend to redistribute existing wealth within a community, not create more of it. 
01/wsj_0126:Its backers fielded every important interest on their team -- a popular mayor, the Chamber of Commerce, the major media -- and spent $100,000 on promotion.
01/wsj_0126:Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces, Mr. Christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal "games" of their own with the voters. 
01/wsj_0126:But to Moon Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor who helped build that city's cavernous, money-losing Superdome, questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance. "The Superdome is an exercise in optimism, a statement of faith," he has said. "It is the very building of it that is important, not how much of it is used or its economics." 
01/wsj_0126:Today taxpayers get to vote, most of the time, on whether they want to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs, or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions. 
01/wsj_0127:While there were no one-time gains or losses in the latest period, there was a one-time gain of #18 million in the 1988 period.
01/wsj_0127:Pretax profit fell 3.7% to #128 million from #133 million and was below analysts' expectations of #130 million to #135 million, but shares rose 6 pence to 388 pence in early trading yesterday in London. 
01/wsj_0127:Reed is paying an interim dividend of 4.6 pence, up 15% from 4 pence a year earlier. 
01/wsj_0127:Earnings were hurt by disposal of operations in its restructuring, Reed said. 
01/wsj_0128:Wall Street's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered. 
01/wsj_0128:The downgrading of debt issued by CS First Boston Inc., parent of First Boston Corp., by Moody's Investors Service Inc., coupled with a Moody's announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade, sent shivers through the brokerage community this week.
01/wsj_0128:With the shudders came the realization that some of Wall Street's biggest players are struggling to maintain the stellar credit standing required to finance their activities profitably. 
01/wsj_0128:Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs, which they sell to finance their daily operations.
01/wsj_0128:"Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business, so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s," says Christopher T. Mahoney, a Moody's vice president. "A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible." Standard & Poor's Corp. says First Boston, Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., in particular, are likely to have difficulty shoring up their credit standing in months ahead. 
01/wsj_0128:That's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors.
01/wsj_0128:"Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation," says Mr. Mahoney of Moody's.
01/wsj_0128:Merchant banking, where firms commit their own money, "is getting riskier, and there's less of it to go around." In addition, he says, the buy-out business is under pressure "because of the junk bond collapse," meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks. 
01/wsj_0128:In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing, with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sales of its assets. 
01/wsj_0128:In a recent report, Moody's said it "expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry, which, combined with overcapacity, will create poor prospects for profitability." It said that the "temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor." 
01/wsj_0128:Both Moody's and S&P cited First Boston's reliance in recent years on merchant banking, which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm's profit.
01/wsj_0128:The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp., First Boston's most lucrative client of the decade, is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $3 billion of high-yield, high-risk junk financings for Campeau units.
01/wsj_0128:In addition, a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co. wasn't repaid on time when its $450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn. 
01/wsj_0128:"These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston's equity," Moody's said. "Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm's equity." CS First Boston, however, benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder, Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third largest bank. 
01/wsj_0128:But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail, or individual investor, business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash.
01/wsj_0128:In addition, Shearson's listed $2 billion of capital is overstated, according to the rating concerns, because it includes $1.7 billion of goodwill.
01/wsj_0128:Shearson "really only has $300 million of capital," says Mr. Bowman of S&P. 
01/wsj_0128:A Shearson spokesman said the firm isn't worried. "A year ago, Moody's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade," he said. "After two months of talks, our rating was maintained." Drexel, meanwhile, already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating. 
01/wsj_0128:The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel, the leading underwriter in that market.
01/wsj_0128:Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness. "We're well positioned with $1.7 billion of capital," a Drexel spokesman said. "And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm, the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view.
01/wsj_0129:Lewis C. Veraldi, the father of the team that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars, retired early after experiencing recent heart problems. 
01/wsj_0129:Most recently, Mr. Veraldi, 59 years old, has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co.
01/wsj_0129:But he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car-development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company's Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division as the top-selling nameplate in the U.S. 
01/wsj_0129:Under the so-called Team Taurus approach, Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers, assembly-line workers, auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle. 
01/wsj_0129:Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen said yesterday that Mr. Veraldi has "helped to change the world's perception of American-made cars." Mr. Veraldi worked at Ford for 40 years, holding a variety of car and parts-engineering positions. 
01/wsj_0130:We can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who've been hurt.
01/wsj_0130:But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk, technology and innovation.
01/wsj_0130:In the 1970s, scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of DES users. 
01/wsj_0130:The cases quickly went to court, but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs couldn't recall whose brand they used.
01/wsj_0130:Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same, and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales. 
01/wsj_0130:Lilly, where the highest New York court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz's mother didn't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages. 
01/wsj_0130:Despite the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case, there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants.
01/wsj_0130:The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs.
01/wsj_0130:The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs, citing the huge, hidden social costs. "Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs, even though some risks, perhaps serious ones, might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering," the unanimous court said.
01/wsj_0130:The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug, Bendectin, off the U.S. market. 
01/wsj_0130:We now know that holding drug makers liable where there's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs won't be available to anyone.
01/wsj_0130:DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts.
01/wsj_0130:Everyone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving people without its becoming some billion-dollar morass.
01/wsj_0131:Odyssey Partners Limited Partnership, an investment firm, completed the purchase of May Department Stores Co. 's Caldor discount chain for $500 million plus the assumption of $52 million in debt. 
01/wsj_0131:Caldor, based in Norwalk, Conn., operates 118 stores in the Northeast; it reported revenue of $1.6 billion last year.
01/wsj_0132:The 32% state-owned DSM had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter, mainly to reflect one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations.
01/wsj_0132:The charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the company's construction division. 
01/wsj_0132:Last year, DSM had 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions. 
01/wsj_0133:Cataracts refer to a clouding of the eye's natural lens. 
01/wsj_0133:Allergan was spun off in July from SmithKline Beckman Corp. as part of the merger of SmithKline and Beecham Group 
01/wsj_0134:The committee's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of Poland's own farmers.
01/wsj_0134:However well intentioned, food transfers have the habit of growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country's own farmers.
01/wsj_0134:The First World has for some time had the bad habit of smothering other people's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness.
01/wsj_0135:Elco Industries Inc. said it expects net income in the year ending June 30, 1990, to fall below a recent analyst's estimate of $1.65 a share. 
01/wsj_0135:The Rockford, Ill., maker of fasteners also said it expects to post sales in the current fiscal year that are "slightly above" fiscal 1989 sales of $155 million.
01/wsj_0136:In fiscal 1988, the company earned $17.3 million, or $1.92 a share, on revenue of $352.9 million. 
01/wsj_0136:Oshkosh Truck attributed the downturn in its earnings to higher start-up costs of its new chassis division, a softer motor-home market and higher administrative costs of compliance with government contractor regulations. 
01/wsj_0136:The company said it is in the process of phasing out John Deere, its current source of production for midsized motor home chassis.
01/wsj_0136:In anticipation of the start-up of its new factory, the company said a larger-than-normal chassis supply has been built to carry it through the transition period. 
01/wsj_0137:At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which gained 132 points Tuesday, added 14.99 points to 35564.43. 
01/wsj_0137:Institutions mostly remained on the sidelines because of uncertainty regarding interest rates and the dollar. 
01/wsj_0137:The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed in the First Section, which gained 16.05 points Tuesday, was down 1.46 points, or 0.05%, at 2691.19. 
01/wsj_0137:Akio Yamamoto, managing director of Nomura Investment Trust Management, said that if the U.S. federal funds rate declines to around 8.5%, institutions would acquire a clearer idea regarding the direction of the market and thus more comfortably participate in active buying.
01/wsj_0137:Wednesday's dominant issue was Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance, which continued to surge on rumors of speculative buying.
01/wsj_0137:Due to continuingly high gold prices tied to uncertainty about the U.S. currency, investor interest was directed toward oil and mining shares, which traders called a "defensive" action frequently taken when the dollar is expected to fall or during times of inflation. 
01/wsj_0137:Teikoku Oil, also stimulated by rumors of speculative buying, advanced 100 yen to 1,460.
01/wsj_0137:It rose largely throughout the session after posting an intraday low of 2141.7 in the first 40 minutes of trading.
01/wsj_0137:The index ended the day near its session high of 2163.2, which was posted within the last half-hour of trading. 
01/wsj_0137:Also, several key blue chips were pushed higher in thin volume because of a technical squeeze among market makers. 
01/wsj_0137:They cited Wall Street's recent volatility and the lack of a clear indication over the market's short-term direction as factors in the institutional caution. 
01/wsj_0137:It shed about 7 pence, however, after dealers said the market was disappointed that Ford didn't move to tender a bid for control of the company. 
01/wsj_0137:Dealers said the U.K. government's decision Tuesday to waive its protective "golden share" in the auto maker raised prospects of a bidding war between the two U.S. auto giants. 
01/wsj_0137:But the waiver also was seen as a signal that Ford, a major U.K. auto industry employer, was able to gain government acceptance of its bid for control of Jaguar.
01/wsj_0137:Dealers said that interpretation sparked expectations of an imminent bid by Ford. 
01/wsj_0137:Analysts said the fall in pretax profit was due to the group's recent restructuring and sale of peripheral units, and that its remaining businesses are performing well.
01/wsj_0137:Drug companies in the key index also notched gains as market-makers searched for stock in anticipation of demand due to the sector's defensive qualities.
01/wsj_0137:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.

01/wsj_0140:The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed seven felony and five misdemeanor counts charging that late last year and early this year the Irvine, Calif.-based circuit-board manufacturer illegally disposed of acid, caustic and heavy metals into the sewer system, and stored hazardous materials in leaky, unlabeled or open-top containers. 
01/wsj_0140:The company said local authorities held hearings on the allegations last spring and had returned the plant to "routine inspection" in August. "The company does not feel that it or any of the individuals violated any criminal statute and the company expects full vindication in court." Arraignments are scheduled for Nov. 14. 
01/wsj_0141:Consumer confidence stayed strong in October, despite the unsettling gyrations of the stock market. 
01/wsj_0141:"The sharp stock market decline in late October appears to have had little or no effect on consumers," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research center. "Survey returns received after the drop in the Dow Jones average were about the same as the views expressed prior to that event." 
01/wsj_0141:The index was 116.9 in October 1988 and in the past year has ranged from a low of 112.9 to a high of 120.7.
01/wsj_0141:It uses a base of 100 in 1985. 
01/wsj_0141:And 19.6% of consumers contacted believed business conditions will improve in the coming six months, compared with 18.3% in September.
01/wsj_0141:"The sustained level of confidence can be attributed to the continued favorable circumstances which affect the consumer's day-to-day economic life," said Mr. Linden. "Unemployment continues at a relatively low level, providing a sense of job security, and a low inflation rate has kept the purchasing power of the weekly paycheck reasonably strong." 
01/wsj_0141:The consumer confidence survey, covering 5,000 U.S. households, is conducted in the first two weeks of each month for the Conference Board by National Family Opinion Inc., a Toledo, Ohio, market researcher.
01/wsj_0141:In October, 6.7% of respondents said they will buy a car, easing from September when 8.1% anticipated a purchase.
01/wsj_0141:In 1989, home purchase plans have ranged monthly from 2.9% to 3.7% of respondents.
01/wsj_0142:Despite a deluge of economic news, the Treasury market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over International Business Machines Corp. 's huge debt offering. 
01/wsj_0142:"There were so many economic reports but the market didn't care about any of them," said Kathleen Camilli, a money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "So the focus turned to other fixed-income markets, corporate and mortgages in particular," she said. 
01/wsj_0142:IBM, the giant computer maker, offered $750 million of non-callable 30-year debentures priced to yield 8.47%, or about 1/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds. 
01/wsj_0142:The size of IBM's issue was increased from an originally planned $500 million as money managers and investors scrambled to buy the bonds. 
01/wsj_0142:Money managers ranked IBM's offering as the most significant investment-grade sale of the year because large issues of long-term debt by companies with triple-A credit are infrequent.
01/wsj_0142:In the Treasury market, investors paid scant attention to the day's economic reports, which for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy. 
01/wsj_0142:A survey by the Federal Reserve's 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management blurred that picture of the economy.
01/wsj_0142:The purchasing managers index of economic activity rose in October, although it remains below 50%.
01/wsj_0142:Mr. Lieberman said the diverse showing in yesterday's reports "only enhances the importance of the employment data." The employment report, which at times has caused wide swings in bond prices, is due out tomorrow.
01/wsj_0142:The average estimate of 22 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in October.
01/wsj_0142:In a surprise announcement, the Treasury said it will reopen the outstanding benchmark 30-year bond rather than create a new one for next week's quarterly refunding of the federal debt. 
01/wsj_0142:The Treasury will raise $10 billion in fresh cash by selling $30 billion of securities, including $10 billion of new three-year notes and $10 billion of new 10-year notes. 
01/wsj_0142:But rather than sell new 30-year bonds, the Treasury will issue $10 billion of 29year, nine-month bonds -- essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30-year bond that was sold at the previous refunding in August. 
01/wsj_0142:The Treasury said the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling.
01/wsj_0142:Until such action takes places, the Treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind. 
01/wsj_0142:In its latest compilation of performance statistics, Moody's Investors Service found that investment-grade bonds posted a total return of 2.7% in October while junk bonds showed a negative return of 1.5%.
01/wsj_0142:For the year to date, Moody's said total returns were topped by the 16.5% of longer-term Treasury issues, closely followed by 15% for investment-grade bonds.
01/wsj_0142:Moody's said the average net asset value of 24 junk-bond mutual funds fell by 4.2% in October. 
01/wsj_0142:A $114 million issue of health facility revenue bonds from the California Health Facilities Financing Authority was temporarily withdrawn after being tentatively priced by a First Boston Corp. group. 
01/wsj_0142:An official for the lead underwriter declined to comment on the reason for the delay, but market participants speculated that a number of factors, including a lack of investor interest, were responsible.
01/wsj_0142:A $107.03 million offering of Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency, Calif., tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may be repriced at lower levels today, according to an official with lead underwriter Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
01/wsj_0142:Bucking the market trend, an issue of $130 million general obligation distributable state aid bonds from Detroit, Mich., apparently drew solid investor interest.
01/wsj_0142:West German dealers said there was little interest in Treasury bonds ahead of Thursday's new government bond issue. 
01/wsj_0143:Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered to double-C from triple-C the rating on about $130 million of debt.
01/wsj_0143:The rating concern said the textile and clothing company's interest expense exceeds operating profit "by a wide margin" and it noted United's estimated after-tax loss of $24 million for the year ended June 30. 
01/wsj_0144:Net advanced to $94.2 million, or 89 cents a share, from $85 million, or 83 cents a share, including net realized investment gains of $31 million, up from $10 million a year ago.
01/wsj_0144:Travelers estimated that the California earthquake last month will result in a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of less than $10 million. 
01/wsj_0144:The insurer's earnings from commercial property/casualty lines fell 59% in the latest quarter, while it lost $7.2 million in its personal property/casualty business, compared with earnings of $6.1 million a year ago. 
01/wsj_0144:Travelers's employee benefits group, which includes its group health insurance operations, posted earnings of $24 million, compared with a loss of $3 million last year. 
01/wsj_0144:In the first nine months, net was $306 million, compared with a loss of $195 million in the 1988 period.
01/wsj_0145:The British Department of Trade and Industry ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of Michelin Tyre PLC's planned acquisition of National Tyre Service Ltd. 
01/wsj_0145:The department said it referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the purchase's possible effects on the U.K. market for distribution of replacement tires. 
01/wsj_0145:BTR PLC, a U.K. industrial conglomerate, said in June it had sold its National Tyre Service business to Michelin Investment Ltd., a U.K. unit of the tire maker, for #140 million ($221.4 million).
01/wsj_0145:Michelin Tyre is a unit of France's Michelin S.A. 
01/wsj_0145:National Tyre, which has 420 branches throughout the U.K., had 1988 pretax profit of #8.5 million. 
01/wsj_0146:Rep. John Dingell, an important sponsor of President Bush's clean-air bill, plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue: acid rain. 
01/wsj_0146:As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell has almost single-handed control over clean-air legislation. 
01/wsj_0146:The administration, sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases, has staunchly opposed cost-sharing. 
01/wsj_0146:While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities, it might not win the support of utilities, many in the West, that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner-burning fuels.
01/wsj_0146:Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House to devise ways to tinker with the administration bill to address their acid-rain concerns. 
01/wsj_0147:Earlier this year Shaw Publishing Inc., Charlotte, acquired 30% of American City and has an agreement to acquire a further 25% from E.W. Scripps Co. next year.
01/wsj_0147:Ray Shaw, chairman of American City, said he would assume Mr. Russell's responsibilities if a successor isn't found this month. 
01/wsj_0148:Several moves were taken following the October 1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility.
01/wsj_0148:The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders.
01/wsj_0148:Used by program traders and others to zip orders into the exchange, SuperDot handles about 80% of all orders entered at the exchange. 
01/wsj_0148:Futures Contracts -- Obligations to buy (for those who have purchased a contract) or deliver (for those who sold one) a quantity of the underlying commodity or financial instrument at the agreed-upon price by a certain date.
01/wsj_0148:Indexing -- Many investors, mainly institutions, follow an investment strategy of buying and holding a mix of stocks to match the performance of a broad stock-market barometer such as the S&P 500.
01/wsj_0148:Program trading -- A wide range of computer-assisted portfolio trading strategies involving the simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks. 
01/wsj_0148:The newest breed, also called "rocket scientists" because of their backgrounds in physics and mathematics, devise the complex hedging and trading strategies that are popularly known as program trading. 
01/wsj_0148:Stock-index arbitrage -- Buying or selling baskets of stocks while at the same time executing offsetting trades in stock-index futures or options.
01/wsj_0148:Stock-index futures -- Contracts to buy or sell the cash value of a stock index by a certain date.
01/wsj_0148:The most common program-trading vehicles are futures contracts on Standard & poor's 500-stock index (traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange); the Major Market Index, a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average (traded on the chicago Board of Trade); and the S&P 100 options (traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and based on 100 stocks selected from the S&P 500). 
01/wsj_0148:Stock-index options -- Options give holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (a call) or sell (a put) a specified amount of an underlying investment by a certin date at a preset price, known as the strike price.
01/wsj_0148:For stock indexes, the underlying investment may be a stock-index futures contract or the cash value of a stock index.

01/wsj_0149:New York financier Saul Steinberg sought federal permission to buy more than 15% of United Airlines' parent, UAL Corp., saying he might seek control of the nation's second-largest airline. 
01/wsj_0149:But some investors have used such filings to boost the value of their stock holdings, which -- without buying more stock -- they then sold. 
01/wsj_0149:Reliance had already bought and sold UAL stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse Oct. 13 of the $6.79 billion, $300-a-share labor-management buy-out.
01/wsj_0149:Reliance acquired a 7% UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $110 a share, and reduced its stake to 4.7% after UAL accepted the bid at prices higher than $282 a share. 
01/wsj_0149:Market sources said Reliance has already sold its entire UAL stake, and thus wouldn't have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock.
01/wsj_0149:But the exact amount of Reliance's current holding hasn't been formally disclosed. 
01/wsj_0149:The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that Coniston Partners, a New York money manager, has bought more than 5% of UAL stock and may challenge the UAL board's decision last week to remain independent.
01/wsj_0149:Speculation about Coniston has caused the stock to rebound from a low of $145. 
01/wsj_0149:UAL wouldn't elaborate on a statement that it had been notified of the filing by Reliance.
01/wsj_0149:Some takeover experts were skeptical, saying it was possible that Mr. Steinberg made the filing only to help boost the value of any remaining Reliance stake in UAL. 
01/wsj_0149:The investor was instrumental in tapping Mr. Wolf to run the air cargo unit of Tiger International Inc. Mr. Wolf's success in that job helped him land the top job with UAL in December 1987. 
01/wsj_0149:But any potential acquirer must attempt to reach some kind of accord with the company's employees, primarily its pilots and the powerful machinists' union, which has opposed a takeover. 
01/wsj_0150:A.L. Williams Corp. was merged into Primerica Corp., New York, after a special meeting of Williams shareholders cleared the transaction, the companies said. 
01/wsj_0150:Primerica, which had owned nearly 70% of Williams, will pay about 16.7 million shares, currently valued at almost $472 million, for the rest of Williams.
01/wsj_0150:Williams shares, which were to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after the close of composite trading yesterday, closed at $23.25, off 12.5 cents.
01/wsj_0150:Primerica, as expected, also acquired certain assets of the agency and assumed certain of its liabilities.
01/wsj_0151:Intelogic Trace Inc., San Antonio, Texas, said it bought 2.7 million shares, or about 18%, of its common stock from an unaffiliated shareholder for $3.625 a share, or $9.9 million. 
01/wsj_0151:Mr. Ackerman already is seeking to oust Mr. Edelman as chairman of Datapoint Corp., an Intelogic affiliate. 
01/wsj_0151:The action followed by one day an Intelogic announcement that it will retain an investment banker to explore alternatives "to maximize shareholder value," including the possible sale of the company. 
01/wsj_0152:The offer, valued at about $576 million for the 33% of Telerate that Dow Jones doesn't already own, had been set to expire Nov. 6. 
01/wsj_0152:Dow Jones, which owns about 64 million of Telerate's 95 million common shares outstanding, said that about 24,000 shares have been tendered under its offer. 
01/wsj_0153:The aerospace, automotive supply, electronics and printing-press concern also indicated that the first half of fiscal 1990 could be rough. 
01/wsj_0153:In an interview, Donald Beall, chairman, said first-half profit certainly would trail the past year's, primarily because of weakness in the heavy-truck and passenger-car markets.
01/wsj_0153:Still, he added, if the industrial sector remains relatively stable, Rockwell should be able to recover in the second half and about equal fiscal 1989's operating profit of $630.9 million. 
01/wsj_0153:That compares with operating earnings of $132.9 million, or 49 cents a share, the year earlier. 
01/wsj_0153:The prior-year period includes a one-time favorable tax adjustment on the B-1B bomber program and another gain from sale of the industrial sewing-machine business, which made net $185.9 million, or 70 cents a share.
01/wsj_0153:For the year, electronics emerged as Rockwell's largest sector in terms of sales and earnings, muscling out aerospace for the first time. 
01/wsj_0153:For the year, bolstered by the introduction of the Colorliner newspaper-printing press, graphics earnings almost doubled. 
01/wsj_0153:Aerospace earnings sagged 37% for the quarter and 15% for the year, largely due to lower B-1B program profit; the last of the bombers rolled out in April 1988.
01/wsj_0153:That was partially offset by the resumption of space shuttle flights and increased demand for expendable launch-vehicle engines. 
01/wsj_0153:The company also took hits in the fourth quarters of 1989 and 1988 on a fixed-price weapons-modernization development program -- probably the C-130 gunship, according to analysts. 
01/wsj_0153:For fiscal 1989, the company posted net of $734.9 million, or $2.87 a share, down from $811.9 million, or $3.04 a share, in fiscal 1988.
01/wsj_0154:Dell Computer Corp. said it cut prices on several of its personal computer lines by 5% to 17%. 
01/wsj_0154:The Austin, Texas-based company, which specializes in the direct sale of personal computers and accessories, said its price cuts include a $100 reduction on its System 210 computer with 512 kilobytes of memory, a 40-megabyte hard disk and a color monitor.
01/wsj_0154:A computer using the more-advanced Intel Corp. 386 microprocessor, with four megabytes of memory and a 100-megabyte hard disk now sells for $5,699, down from $6,799. 
01/wsj_0155:Prices also were boosted by another rumor that Mexico, usually a large producer and exporter, might have to buy a large quantity of sugar. 
01/wsj_0155:The March and May contracts rose to fresh life-of-contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day.
01/wsj_0155:The May contract, which also is without restraints, ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents.
01/wsj_0155:The July delivery rose its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent a pound to 14.00 cents, while other contract months showed near-limit advances. 
01/wsj_0155:One analyst, Arthur Stevenson, of Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, estimated that 65% or more of Brazil's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and can't use gasoline. "This is a demand that must be met, regardless of the price of oil," said Mr. Stevenson. 
01/wsj_0155:Brazil is the third-largest producer and the fifth-largest exporter of sugar in the world.
01/wsj_0155:During the current crop year, Brazil was expected to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar, a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988-89.
01/wsj_0155:Its 1989-90 exports were expected to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5 million tons in 
01/wsj_0155:More than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production, according to Ms. Ganes.
01/wsj_0155:Also, there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane, and this change is being felt now, she said. 
01/wsj_0155:Most important, Ms. Ganes noted, "Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports." 
01/wsj_0155:Thomas Oxnard, sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack, N.J., said: "I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports, particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound." 
01/wsj_0155:Above all, Mr. Oxnard noted, the situation is extremely confused. "Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation," he said. "It's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out, such as the one saying exports will be suspended, and no one can confirm it." 
01/wsj_0155:On the one hand, Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program. 
01/wsj_0155:"It has to weigh, on the other hand, the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol," Mr. Oxnard said. 
01/wsj_0155:This year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs, analysts said. 
01/wsj_0155:The firmness in heating oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute, which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel. 
01/wsj_0155:GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come.
01/wsj_0155:Trading was muted in part because of the observance of All Saints' Day across much of Europe.
01/wsj_0155:As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S., market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government, which often buys U.S. grains in quantity, turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat.
01/wsj_0155:Traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S.
01/wsj_0155:The Soviets are widely believed to need additional supplies, despite running up record one-month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in October. 
01/wsj_0155:Separately, Reuter reported that the Papua-New Guinea government urged its Parliament to extend a state of emergency in copper-rich Bougainville Island for two months.
01/wsj_0155:The Bougainville copper mine has been inoperative since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners who want Bougainville to secede from Papua-New Guinea. 
01/wsj_0156:The parent of Younkers, after failing to find a buyer for the chain of Midwestern department stores, said it will sell a stake in the chain to management and take other steps to reduce its investment in retailing. 
01/wsj_0156:Equitable of Iowa Cos., Des Moines, had been seeking a buyer for the 36-store Younkers chain since June, when it announced its intention to free up capital to expand its insurance business.
01/wsj_0156:But Equitable said it was unable to find a buyer willing to pay what it considers "fair value" for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing. 
01/wsj_0156:Younkers rang up sales in 1988 of $313 million.
01/wsj_0157:Under terms of the new proposal, Equus, managed by Equus Capital Corp., Houston, would pay $12 cash and one new preferred share with a liquidation preference of $1.65 a share for each of Tony Lama's 2.1 million shares outstanding.
01/wsj_0157:The El Paso, Texas, maker of Western boots and leather accessories said the preferred stock would accrue dividends at a 12% rate, but wouldn't be paid for the first two years.
01/wsj_0157:The stock would be redeemed in five years, subject to terms of the surviving company's debt. 
01/wsj_0157:However, Tony Lama said it would promptly submit the offer to a special committee of the company's board. 
01/wsj_0158:Mr. Reupke was one of three executives on Reuters's eight-person executive committee who didn't also serve on the company's board of directors. "If I were choosing the people of tomorrow, I would have chosen the people who are now on the board," he said. 
01/wsj_0158:The senior of the three executives who will assume Mr. Reupke's duties is Nigel Judah, 58, finance director and a Reuters board director.
01/wsj_0158:Peter Holland, 45, deputy general manager, becomes director of corporate affairs.
01/wsj_0158:And Patrick Mannix, 46, international technical manager, becomes director of group quality programs. 
01/wsj_0159:DD Acquisition Corp., a partnership of Unicorp Canada Corp. 's Kingsbridge Capital Group and Cara Operations Ltd., extended to Nov. 20 its $45-a-share offer for all Dunkin' Donuts Inc. shares outstanding. 
01/wsj_0159:The offer, which was due to expire yesterday, is conditional on 50.1% of Dunkin' common shares, on a fully diluted basis, being tendered and on the withdrawal of the company's poison pill rights plan. 
01/wsj_0159:DD Acquisition has launched a suit in a Delaware court seeking the withdrawal of Dunkin's poison pill rights and employee stock ownership plans, which it claims were put in place to deter bidders. 
01/wsj_0159:DD Acquisition said 2.2 million shares, or about 38.5% of the shares outstanding, have been tendered under its offer.
01/wsj_0159:The partners said they already hold 15% of all shares outstanding. 
01/wsj_0159:Dunkin' has set Nov. 10 as the deadline for the receipt of any competing bids.
01/wsj_0160:Savin Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of $35.2 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $3.8 million, or one cent a share. 
01/wsj_0160:A spokesman for the Stamford, Conn.based company said operations had a loss of $5.5 million for the quarter; in addition, the loss was magnified by nonrecurring charges totaling $23.5 million and $8.2 million in asset-valuation adjustments that he described as "unusual." The charges were partly offset by a $2 million gain on the sale of investments of two joint ventures, he said. 
01/wsj_0161:Hadson Corp. said it expects to report a third-quarter net loss of $17 million to $19 million because of special reserves and continued low natural-gas prices. 
01/wsj_0161:The company also cited interest costs and amortization of goodwill as factors in the loss. 
01/wsj_0161:A year earlier, net income was $2.1 million, or six cents a share, on revenue of $169.9 million. 
01/wsj_0162:A lack of enthusiasm with the latest economic data hampered the stock market's bid to extend Tuesday's sharp gains, as prices closed slightly higher in sluggish trading. 
01/wsj_0162:While renewed optimism about the outlook for takeover activity boosted several so-called deal stocks, traders said profit-taking weighed on the market, with blue-chips bearing the brunt of the selling. 
01/wsj_0162:The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had jumped 41.60 points on Tuesday, drifted on either side of its previous close and finished with a gain of just 0.82 at 2645.90. 
01/wsj_0162:Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index added 0.84 to 341.20; the rise was equivalent to a gain of about six points in the industrial average.
01/wsj_0162:The October survey of corporate purchasing managers, as expected, provided evidence that economic growth remains subdued.
01/wsj_0162:An index of economic activity drawn from the survey stood last month at 47.6%; a reading above 50% would have indicated that the manufacturing sector was improving. 
01/wsj_0162:"This market's still going through its pains," said Philip Puccio, head of equity trading at Prudential-Bache Securities. "The psychology is still: `We want (stocks) up, but if they don't carry we're going to sell them. '" 
01/wsj_0162:Uncertainty about the prospects for further action to curtail stock-index arbitrage, a form of program trading blamed for recent volatility in the market, also contributed to its lack of direction, Mr. Puccio said. 
01/wsj_0162:Arbitrage-related trading during the session was confined largely to a round of buy programs near the close, which helped offset the impact of profit-taking among blue chips. 
01/wsj_0162:Trading is expected to remain subdued as the market awaits tomorrow's release of the jobs data with the hope that it will point toward a decline in interest rates. "I sense that some people are reluctant to stick their necks out in any aggressive way until after the figures come out," said Richard Eakle, president of Eakle Associates, Fair Haven, 
01/wsj_0162:Campbell Soup jumped 3 3/8 to 47 1/8 as the resignation of R. Gordon McGovern as president and chief executive officer sparked a revival of rumors that the company could become a takeover target.
01/wsj_0162:AMR climbed 1 3/4 to 73 1/8 amid rumors that New York developer Donald Trump was seeking financing to mount a new, lower offer for the parent company of American Airlines.

01/wsj_0165:Heritage, which owns 51% of POP's 3.6 million shares outstanding, said it will exchange one share of a new preferred stock for each POP common share it doesn't already own.
01/wsj_0165:Depending upon how many warrants and options are exercised prior to completion of the transaction, Heritage would issue between 1.8 million and 2.35 million preferred shares, a Heritage spokesman estimated.

01/wsj_0168:Meridian National Corp. said it sold 750,000 shares of its common stock to the McAlpine family interests, for $1 million, or $1.35 a share.
01/wsj_0168:The sale represents 10.2% of Meridian's shares outstanding. 
01/wsj_0168:The McAlpine family, which operates a number of multinational companies, including a London-based engineering and construction company, also lent to Meridian National $500,000.
01/wsj_0168:That amount is convertible into shares of Meridian common stock at $2 a share during its one-year term.
01/wsj_0168:The sale of shares to the McAlpine family along with the recent sale of 750,000 shares of Meridian stock to Haden MacLellan Holding PLC of Surrey, England and a recent public offering have increased Meridian's net worth to $8.5 million, said William Feniger, chief executive officer of Toledo, Ohio-based Meridian.

01/wsj_0171:The bulk of the pretax charge is a $62 million write-off of capitalized servicing at the mobile home financing subsidiary, which the company said had been a big drain on earnings.
01/wsj_0171:Valley Federal also added $18 million to realestate loan reserves and eliminated $9.9 million of good will.

01/wsj_0172:First of America said some of the managers will take other jobs with First of America.
01/wsj_0172:But it said that severance payments to those executives not staying with the company will reduce First of America's operating results for 1989 by $3 million to $4 million, or 15 cents to 20 cents a share.

01/wsj_0179:Bears have targeted Columbia's stock because of the thrift's exposure to the shaky junk market.
01/wsj_0179:And some investors fault Mr. Spiegel's life style; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia's jet planes. 
01/wsj_0179:Moreover, junk professionals think Columbia's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $4.4 billion wasn't enough, meaning another markdown could be coming. 
01/wsj_0179:Mr. Spiegel's fans say Columbia's Southern California branches are highly salable, and the thrift has $458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets.
01/wsj_0179:That's almost $10 of equity for each Columbia share, including convertible preferred shares, though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion. 
01/wsj_0179:The Spiegel family has 25% of the common and 75% of the votes.
01/wsj_0179:While many problems would attend a restructuring of Columbia, investors say Mr. Spiegel is mulling such a plan to mitigate Columbia's junk problems.
01/wsj_0179:That's why Columbia just wrote off $130 million of its junk and reserved $227 million for future junk losses.
01/wsj_0179:Possibly offsetting that, Columbia recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $70 million.
01/wsj_0179:It also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $300 million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings. 
01/wsj_0179:But Columbia's good bank would be a regulated thrift, while the bad bank would be a private investment company, holding some of Columbia's junk bonds, real estate and equity investments. 
01/wsj_0179:The thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity, financial industry executives say. 
01/wsj_0179:You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank," says thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri of Ranieri Associates in New York. 
01/wsj_0179:Mr. Spiegel's next career move is a subject of speculation on Wall Street.
01/wsj_0179:Of course, regulators would have to approve Columbia's reorganization.
01/wsj_0180:The second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein-1, a substance that can induce formation of new cartilage.
01/wsj_0180:The company added that it has filed patent applications "on a large number of different BMP proteins" and the patent on BMP-1 is the first it has received.
01/wsj_0181:The Bush administration's nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the American Bar Association gave Mr. Thomas only a "qualified" rating, rather than "well qualified." 
01/wsj_0181:People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will vote on the nomination, said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter.
01/wsj_0181:Mr. Thomas, currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court.
01/wsj_0181:Groups have accused him of advocating policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies.
01/wsj_0181:Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said they oppose Mr. Thomas's nomination because of "serious questions about his judgment {and} respect for the law." 
01/wsj_0181:In contrast, the lawyers' association gives a "well qualified" rating to those "regarded as one of the best available for the vacancy." 
01/wsj_0182:Metallgesellschaft AG said it agreed to acquire 51% of Lentjes AG from the Ferdinand Lentjes Foundation.
01/wsj_0182:Metallgesellschaft, a diversified Frankfurt, West Germany-based metals group, said it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants.
01/wsj_0182:Lentjes' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b.
01/wsj_0182:The move is part of a strategy to focus on its core metals trading, processing and plant engineering activities while shedding peripheral units, the company said. 
01/wsj_0182:Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks ($434.4 million) and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks. 
01/wsj_0182:The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock.
01/wsj_0182:A plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices. 
01/wsj_0183:The U.S. International Trade Commission issued preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry. 
01/wsj_0183:Because of the rulings, the Commerce Department will continue to investigate complaints by U.S. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the U.S. at unfairly low prices in violation of the U.S. anti-dumping act.
01/wsj_0183:The law defines unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter's home market. 
01/wsj_0183:If both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law, the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports, which already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements. 
01/wsj_0183:Imports of manmade-fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $405 million from Taiwan, $400 million from South Korea and $125 million from Hong Kong, according to the ITC. 
01/wsj_0183:In another action, the ITC dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed by Du Pont Co. of Wilmington, Del., against imports of neoprene, a type of synthetic rubber, from France and West Germany.
01/wsj_0184:Upjohn officials said they couldn't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees, and how many, will participate in the retirement plan.
01/wsj_0184:In addition, Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay. 
01/wsj_0184:Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and "an effective headcount-control program." 
01/wsj_0184:But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have, because few jobs will end up being eliminated. "It's a cosmetic move," said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co. 
01/wsj_0184:According to Upjohn's estimates, only 50% to 60% of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan.
01/wsj_0184:Upjohn further estimated that about 50% of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced.
01/wsj_0184:As a result, Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide. 
01/wsj_0184:An Upjohn spokesman said he had "heard nothing" to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company, which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation.
01/wsj_0185:INTER-TEL Inc. (Chandler, Ariz.) -- Jerry Chapman, managing director of WayMar Associates, was elected a director of this business telecommunications software and systems concern.
01/wsj_0186:"Feeding Frenzy" (Henry Holt, 326 pages, $19.95), a highly detailed account of the Wedtech scandal, begins on a reassuring note. 
01/wsj_0186:Right up front in the preface, co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity.
01/wsj_0186:When offered a free trip from the Bronx, Wedtech's home, to Washington, D.C., by one of Wedtech's principals, he tells the reader, "mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing about, I declined." 
01/wsj_0186:Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive, high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers.
01/wsj_0186:Bribe by bribe, Mr. Sternberg and his co-author, Matthew C. Harrison Jr., lead us along the path Wedtech traveled, from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor, entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy. 
01/wsj_0186:The book revolves around John Mariotta, the founder of the company, and Fred Neuberger, who became his partner soon after Wedtech's creation.
01/wsj_0186:Mr. Neuberger realized that, although of Italian ancestry, Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico.
01/wsj_0186:The two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation.
01/wsj_0186:Instead of 50/50 it became, on paper only, two-thirds Mariotta, one-third Neuberger, and they were in the program and off to the races. 
01/wsj_0186:Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi (now serving a jail sentence), the company began a career of bribing federal, state and local public officials and those close to public officials, right up to and including E. Robert Wallach, close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese.
01/wsj_0186:It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling, retaining politically connected "respectable" law firms, investment bankers and political consultants, including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger.
01/wsj_0186:But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy, easy-to-read tabloid writing style, "Feeding Frenzy" often falls short of gripping reading.
01/wsj_0186:None of the scams show much ingenuity: Auditors found crookery the first day on the job.
01/wsj_0186:Among the lot of them, not one is wrestling with good and evil, or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane.
01/wsj_0186:The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz, a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack.
01/wsj_0186:Absorbed in doling out "Feeding Frenzy's" tidbits, the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech, namely the Section 8(A) federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place.
01/wsj_0186:In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party.
01/wsj_0186:They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth, regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment, there is big money to be made in influencing, brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government.
01/wsj_0186:They are our version of the East bloc's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change.
01/wsj_0186:How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders?
01/wsj_0186:Mr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp., 1983-85. 
01/wsj_0187:The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle to form a new company to complete most of the troubled shipyard's backlog of 15 ships. 
01/wsj_0187:The new company will attempt to limit the shipyard's losses, participants said. "The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business.
01/wsj_0187:Everything will be taken over by the new company," said Christian Andersson, executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae, former parent of Waertsilae Marine. 
01/wsj_0187:Subcontractors will be offered a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine's two big shipyards, government officials said. 
01/wsj_0187:Under an accord signed yesterday, the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company, each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa ($23.5 million).
01/wsj_0187:Oy Waertsilae is to contribute 200 million markkaa, most of it as subordinated debt, and take a minority stake in the new company. 
01/wsj_0187:Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine's undelivered ships are expected to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital, government officials said. 
01/wsj_0188:Its plans to be acquired dashed, Comprehensive Care Corp. said it plans to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in California and some other assets to pay its debt and provide working capital. 
01/wsj_0188:In addition, the company has replaced its president and chief executive, naming W. James Nichol, head of the company's contract health services, to succeed B. Lee Karns.
01/wsj_0188:Mr. Nichol said he was "extremely disappointed in the continuing deterioration of the company's operations while it attempted to conclude the reorganization during the past four months." Concurrent with Mr. Nichol's appointment, Comprehensive Care moved its corporate headquarters from Irvine, Calif., to St. Louis, where the company maintained its contract services offices. 
01/wsj_0188:Comprehensive Care had agreed to be acquired by closely held First Hospital Corp. of Norfolk, Va., but the sale sputtered almost from the beginning and finally collapsed last week. 
01/wsj_0189:This year's results included a gain of $70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations.
01/wsj_0189:Ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville, N.C., the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company.
01/wsj_0189:Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures, which required higher advertising spending.
01/wsj_0190:Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
01/wsj_0191:First Chicago Corp. said it completed its $55.1 million cash-and-stock acquisition of closely held Ravenswood Financial Corp., another Chicago bank holding company. 
01/wsj_0192:Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business.
01/wsj_0192:And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the Soviets. 
01/wsj_0192:The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn in October, which is the most ever sold to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S.
01/wsj_0192:The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered by January, which would be a strain in most years. 
01/wsj_0192:But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River, on which flows much of the U.S. corn that is shipped overseas. 
01/wsj_0192:"We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record," said William Dunton, a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert. "It is going to be real tight." 
01/wsj_0192:Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains, the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time. 
01/wsj_0192:In a few weeks, many barges probably won't be able to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the Missouri River, which feeds into the Mississippi River.
01/wsj_0192:The Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it. 
01/wsj_0192:But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month.
01/wsj_0192:At St. Louis, the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed, an Army Corps spokesman said.
01/wsj_0192:Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years. 
01/wsj_0192:So far, the grain industry's budding logistical problems haven't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade.
01/wsj_0192:Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers. 
01/wsj_0192:At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $2.375 a bushel. 
01/wsj_0192:Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices.
01/wsj_0192:In parts of Iowa, for example, some grain elevators are offering farmers $2.15 a bushel for corn.
01/wsj_0192:Many farmers probably wouldn't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel, said Lyle Reed, president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo, Iowa. 
01/wsj_0192:Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought, the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins. 
01/wsj_0192:Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation. "The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped," said Bill Biedermann, Allendale Inc. research director. 
01/wsj_0192:Although much of this country's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge, it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port. 
01/wsj_0192:The Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October because of delays.
01/wsj_0192:But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems. 
01/wsj_0192:ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading, but much of the action was in heating oil.
01/wsj_0192:Precious metals, gold in particular, currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability, according to William O'Neill, vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York. "The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities," he said.
01/wsj_0192:Silver and platinum, which have more of an industrial nature than gold, were even weaker, he said.
01/wsj_0192:Silver is also under pressure of "extremely high" inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange, he said.
01/wsj_0192:Yesterday, these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces, according to an exchange spokesman. 
01/wsj_0192:Reasons for the walkout, the analyst said, included a number of procedural issues, such as a right to strike.
01/wsj_0192:In the case of copper, he said, the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal.
01/wsj_0192:Also contributing to the firmness in copper, the analyst noted, was a report by Chicago purchasing agents, which precedes the full purchasing agents' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold.
01/wsj_0192:The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's October index rose to 51.6% after three previous months of readings below 50%.
01/wsj_0192:A reading below 50% generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy, while a reading above 50% points to expansion.
01/wsj_0192:The Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50%. 
01/wsj_0193:NCR Corp. unveiled two models of its Tower line of midrange computers and introduced advanced networking software to allow the Tower family to operate as a central hub in a network of computers. 
01/wsj_0194:The recent quarter includes pretax gains of $98 million from asset sales, while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $61 million.
01/wsj_0194:However, third-quarter operating profit fell 14%, as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments, eliminating income from those operations. 
01/wsj_0194:The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain, Ohio, plant, which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan's Kobe Steel Ltd. 
01/wsj_0194:Profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $33 a ton from $42 a ton last year and $53 a ton in the second quarter, analysts said.
01/wsj_0194:Still, USX fared better than other major steelmakers, earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem Steel Corp., which posted a 54% drop in net income, or Inland Steel Industries Inc., whose profit plummeted 70%. 
01/wsj_0194:In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, USX shares closed up $1.25, at $34.625, as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who hadn't expected as great a volume of asset sales.
01/wsj_0194:He said USX also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products, such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet, than lower-priced structural goods. 
01/wsj_0194:Proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares.
01/wsj_0194:The company noted that it has reduced debt by $1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought back about 15.5 million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of 1987.
01/wsj_0194:The announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1% and threatened a takeover or other business combination.
01/wsj_0196:Leon J. Level, vice president and chief financial officer of this computer services concern, and F. Warren McFarlan, a professor at Harvard University's Graduate School of Business, were elected directors, increasing board membership to nine. 
01/wsj_0197:David A. DiLoreto, president of metal container division, was named to the additional post of group vice president, packaging products, at this packaging, industrial and aerospace products concern, succeeding Delmont A. Davis, who was named president and chief operating officer in August. 
01/wsj_0198:Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors, as well as the views of previous presidents. 
01/wsj_0198:A line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure.
01/wsj_0198:But the two legal experts, responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), wrote in a joint letter that the president "lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto." The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal. 
01/wsj_0198:Moreover, they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items, and there was no discussion of a line-item veto.
01/wsj_0198:They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War, and "all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach" of the president. 
01/wsj_0198:Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power, but that it would be a "reckless course of action" for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval. 
01/wsj_0199:Trinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to sell 500 railcar platforms to Trailer Train Co. of Chicago.
01/wsj_0199:Trinity said it plans to begin delivery in the first quarter of next year. 
02/wsj_0200:In an Oct. 19 review of "The Misanthrope" at Chicago's Goodman Theatre ("Revitalized Classics Take the Stage in Windy City," Leisure & Arts), the role of Celimene, played by Kim Cattrall, was mistakenly attributed to Christina Haag.
02/wsj_0203:A SEC proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company executives would undermine the usefulness of information on insider trades as a stock-picking tool, individual investors and professional money managers contend. 
02/wsj_0203:The proposed changes also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often. 
02/wsj_0203:Many of the letters maintain that investor confidence has been so shaken by the 1987 stock market crash -- and the markets already so stacked against the little guy -- that any decrease in information on insider-trading patterns might prompt individuals to get out of stocks altogether. 
02/wsj_0203:"The SEC has historically paid obeisance to the ideal of a level playing field," wrote Clyde S. McGregor of Winnetka, Ill., in one of the 92 letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed Aug. 17. "Apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal." 
02/wsj_0203:Currently, the rules force executives, directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies' shares within about a month after the transaction.
02/wsj_0203:But about 25% of the insiders, according to SEC figures, file their reports late. 
02/wsj_0203:The changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives "who are really calling the shots," said Brian Lane, special counsel at the SEC's office of disclosure policy, which proposed the changes. 
02/wsj_0203:The Committee on Federal Regulation of Securities for the American Bar Association argues, for example, in its lengthy letter to the SEC, that the proposed changes "would substantially improve the {law} by conforming it more closely to contemporary business realities." 
02/wsj_0203:What the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot telltale "clusters" of trading activity -- buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time.
02/wsj_0203:The rules will eliminate filings by "vice presidents of maintenance and personnel," but will still require reports from vice presidents of sensitive or policy-making divisions, such as sales, marketing, finance and research and development, Mr. Lane said. 
02/wsj_0203:Companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time. 
02/wsj_0203:But Robert Gabele, president of Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., company that packages and sells the insider-trading data, said the proposal is worded so vaguely that key officials may fail to file the reports. 
02/wsj_0204:Some 4,300 institutions are part of the pension fund. 
02/wsj_0204:The new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund, under pressure to relax its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options, reached with the SEC in December. 
02/wsj_0204:The new "social choice" fund will shun securities of companies linked to South Africa, nuclear power and in some cases, Northern Ireland.
02/wsj_0204:Sixty percent of the fund will be invested in stocks, with the rest going into bonds or short-term investments. 
02/wsj_0205:New Brunswick Scientific Co., a maker of biotechnology instrumentation and equipment, said it adopted an anti-takeover plan giving shareholders the right to purchase shares at half price under certain conditions. 
02/wsj_0206:W. Ed Tyler, 37 years old, a senior vice president at this printing concern, was elected president of its technology group, a new position. 
02/wsj_0207:Years ago, he collaborated with the new music gurus Peter Serkin and Fred Sherry in the very countercultural chamber group Tashi, which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time." 
02/wsj_0207:Today, the pixie-like clarinetist has mostly dropped the missionary work (though a touch of the old Tashi still survives) and now goes on the road with piano, bass, a slide show, and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop, with a few notable exceptions.
02/wsj_0207:He launched into Saint-Saens's "The Swan" from "Carnival of the Animals," a favorite encore piece for cellists, with lovely, glossy tone and no bite.
02/wsj_0207:Then, as if to show that he could play fast as well, he offered the second movement from Saint-Saens's Sonata for Clarinet, a whimsical, puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality. 
02/wsj_0207:And so it went through the first half: an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces, none longer than five minutes, none that would disturb or challenge a listener.
02/wsj_0207:Mr. Stoltzman tied the composer in by proclaiming him "the great improviser of the 18th century," and then built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some Bach two-part inventions, cleverly arranged for clarinet and bassoon by Mr. Douglas.
02/wsj_0207:The end of the first half, however, brought what the standing-room-only crowd seemed to be waiting for: the pop singer Judy Collins, who appears on "Inner Voices." Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever, Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell's "For Free" -- about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist, to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing, "Deep Peace." "Deep Peace" also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds, beaches, deserts, sunsets, etc.
02/wsj_0207:Was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half?
02/wsj_0207:Either way it was a pity, because Mr. Stolzman offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission: Steve Reich's "New York Counterpoint," one of a series of Reich works that juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing. (Mr.
02/wsj_0207:He also unfortunately illustrated this intricate, jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson's images, this time of geometric or repeating objects, in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich's piece and Mr. Stoltzman's elegant execution of it.
02/wsj_0207:The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker, Ornette Coleman, Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez, with pictures for the Douglas pieces.
02/wsj_0207:It was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club, but like the first half, much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable. 
02/wsj_0207:Is this the future of chamber music?
02/wsj_0207:Managers and presenters insist that chamber music concerts are a hard sell, but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is purged of threatening elements, served up in bite-sized morsels and accompanied by visuals?
02/wsj_0207:It was not an unpleasant evening, certainly, thanks to the high level of performance, the compositional talents of Mr. Douglas, and the obvious sincerity with which Mr. Stoltzman chooses his selections.
02/wsj_0207:But it was neither deep nor lasting: light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of Brahms. 
02/wsj_0208:One of Ronald Reagan's attributes as President was that he rarely gave his blessing to the claptrap that passes for "consensus" in various international institutions.
02/wsj_0208:In fact, he liberated the U.S. from one of the world's most corrupt organizations -- UNESCO.
02/wsj_0208:This is the U.N. group that managed to traduce its own charter of promoting education, science and culture.
02/wsj_0208:But we can think of many reasons to stay out for the foreseeable future and well beyond. 
02/wsj_0208:The U.S., along with Britain and Singapore, left the agency when its anti-Western ideology, financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand.
02/wsj_0208:The personal antics of agency Director Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow drew much attention, such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as KGB plants and ejected from France and when a mysterious office fire was set just before Congress sent accountants to trace U.S. funds. 
02/wsj_0208:The Orwellian "New World Information Order" would give government officials rights against the press; journalists would be obliged to kowtow to their government, which would have licensing and censorship powers and, indeed, duties to block printing of "wrong" ideas. 
02/wsj_0208:UNESCO somehow converted the founding U.N. ideals of individual rights and liberty into "peoples' rights." Million-dollar conferences were held to chew on subjects such as "ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament" and "the impact of the activities of transnational corporations." 
02/wsj_0208:The agency was so totally subverted from the high principles of its founding that even the Soviets now wonder about an agency that seemed so congenial to them.
02/wsj_0208:Soviets remain in charge of education programs, a former head of an African military tribunal for executions is in charge of culture, and a hard-line Polish communist in exile directs the human-rights and peace division.
02/wsj_0208:Of the agency's 2,750 staff members, 230 are in the field working on actual projects, such as literacy and oceanographic research. 
02/wsj_0208:The position of the United States, which once contributed 25% of the budget, is that nothing has changed.
02/wsj_0208:John Bolton, the assistant secretary of state for international organizations, told Congress that the continuing "statist, restrictive, nondemocratic" programs make rejoining any time soon "extremely unlikely." This hasn't much bothered the UNESCO delegates, who last week couldn't even agree to raise funds by selling off a fancy 19th-century French chateau the agency somehow owns.
02/wsj_0208:This is that the Reagan Revolution spanning Eastern Europe and Tiananmen Square shows the power of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries.
02/wsj_0208:Free markets, free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get muddled only when delivered through U.N. organizations -- which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home. 
02/wsj_0208:The Babelists of the United Nations are experts at obfuscation.
02/wsj_0208:This can have its purposes at times, but there's no reason to cloud the importance and allure of Western concepts of freedom and justice.
02/wsj_0208:We can see plenty of reasons to stay out, and none to rejoin UNESCO. 
02/wsj_0209:Researchers at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. in Belgium said they have developed a genetic engineering technique for creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops. 
02/wsj_0209:The researchers said they have isolated a plant gene that prevents the production of pollen.
02/wsj_0209:Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant, thereby producing hybrid seed.
02/wsj_0209:The new generation of plants will possess the flourishing, high-production trait known as "hybrid vigor," similar to that now seen in hybrid corn. 
02/wsj_0209:"The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production, especially cotton," said Murray Robinson, president of Delta & Pine Land Co., a Southwide Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S. 
02/wsj_0209:On a commercial scale, the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains.
02/wsj_0209:In a labor-intensive process, the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant, making it male sterile.
02/wsj_0209:They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby, which then pollinate the male-sterile plants.
02/wsj_0209:The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies. 
02/wsj_0209:The male part, the anthers of the plant, and the female, the pistils, of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other.
02/wsj_0209:In China, a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers, and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds.
02/wsj_0209:Jan Leemans, research director, said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants, a major crop in Europe and Canada, using as a carrier a "promoter gene" developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles. 
02/wsj_0209:The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant.
02/wsj_0209:Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation doesn't hurt the growth of that plant. 
02/wsj_0209:The laws of heredity dictate that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse-produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible.
02/wsj_0209:The application of herbicide would kill off the male-fertile plants, leaving a large field of male-sterile plants that can be cross-pollinated to produce hybrid seed. 
02/wsj_0209:"This technique is applicable to a wide variety of crops," he said, and added that some modifications may be necessary to accommodate the peculiarities of each type of crop.
02/wsj_0209:He said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are hybrids, the genetic approach will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers, which costs U.S. seed producers about $70 million annually. 
02/wsj_0209:In recent years, demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies, including Monsanto Co., Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co.
02/wsj_0209:One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant's pollen.
02/wsj_0209:But there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans, animals and beneficial insects. 
02/wsj_0209:However, Paul Johanson, Monsanto's director of plant sciences, said the company's chemical spray overcomes these problems and is "gentle on the female organ." 
02/wsj_0209:Robert Erwin, president of Biosource, called Plant Genetic's approach "interesting" and "novel," and "complementary rather than competitive." "There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds," he said. 
02/wsj_0209:Mr. Robinson of Delta & Pine, the seed producer in Scott, Miss., said Plant Genetic's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles doesn't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops.
02/wsj_0210:A bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between Nomura Securities Co. and Industrial Bank of Japan, two of the world's most powerful financial companies. 
02/wsj_0210:The clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in Japan's once-cozy financial circles.
02/wsj_0210:What triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue.
02/wsj_0210:Nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen ($352 million) borrowing in Japan at a time when many Japanese banks, led by Industrial Bank of Japan, were pressuring the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by New Zealand's civil-service pension fund.
02/wsj_0210:The dispute shows clearly the global power of Japan's financial titans.
02/wsj_0210:Barred by its budget law from making any new domestic bond issues, Wellington's Debt Management Office had been casting abroad to raise the 3 billion New Zealand dollars (US$1.76 billion) to NZ$4 billion it needs to come up with by the end of its fiscal year next June 30.
02/wsj_0210:No less significant than the Japanese banks' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries.
02/wsj_0210:The banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business.
02/wsj_0210:Meanwhile, the securities companies -- most of them smaller than the banks -- are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that wouldn't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks. 
02/wsj_0210:Nomura, the world's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field, and Industrial Bank of Japan, Japan's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad, captain the opposing sides.
02/wsj_0210:And their suspicions of each other run deep. 
02/wsj_0210:In the past year, both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses.
02/wsj_0210:Nomura started a credit-card venture with American Express Co. that allowed cardholders to use their Nomura securities accounts like a bank account, attracting the wrath of banks.
02/wsj_0210:And Industrial Bank of Japan started up a London securities subsidiary that sells Japanese stocks to non-Japanese institutions overseas, a move that stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms.
02/wsj_0211:ITEL CORP. reported third-quarter earnings, which were mistakenly shown in the Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in yesterday's edition to be lower than the average of analysts' estimates.
02/wsj_0211:On a pretax basis, Itel's third-quarter earnings of 30 cents a share were actually 7.14% higher than the average of estimates. 
02/wsj_0213:He will be in charge of research, equity sales and trading, and the syndicate operation of Rothschild.
02/wsj_0213:Mr. Conlon was executive vice president and director of the equity division of the international division of Nikko Securities Co. 
02/wsj_0214:On the mound, former Red Sox great Luis Tiant, the wily master of 1,001 moves, throws an off-speed strike. 
02/wsj_0214:But for the next few months, these boys of summers long past are going to be reveling in an Indian summer of the soul.
02/wsj_0214:Today is the debut of the Senior Professional Baseball Association, a new eight-team pro sports circuit, modeled after the highly successful senior tennis and golf tours and complete with good salaries, a cable television contract and even expansion plans.
02/wsj_0214:For everyone involved, it's one more swig of that elixir of youth, baseball. 
02/wsj_0214:Until the baby-faced heroes of today reclaim these ballparks for spring training, there is one more. 
02/wsj_0214:It's one more for the baseball-loving lawyers, accountants and real estate developers who ponied up about $1 million each for the chance to be an owner, to step into the shoes of a Gene Autry or have a beer with Rollie Fingers. 
02/wsj_0214:"Nothing can be better than this," says Don Sider, owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics.
02/wsj_0214:It's one more, too, for the fans who dream of a season that never ends. "I feel like a little kid," says a gleeful Alex de Castro, a car salesman, who has stopped by a workout of the Suns to slip six Campaneris cards to the Great Man Himself to be autographed.
02/wsj_0214:The league is the brainchild of Colorado real estate developer James Morley -- once a minor-leaguer himself -- who says he had the idea last January while lying on a beach in Australia.
02/wsj_0214:When he sent letters offering 1,250 retired major leaguers the chance of another season, 730 responded.
02/wsj_0214:But as they hurl fireballs that smolder rather than burn, and relive old duels in the sun, it's clear that most are there to make their fans cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of seasons past or prove to themselves and their colleagues that they still have it -- or something close to it. 
02/wsj_0214:Real good," says 39-year-old Pete Broberg, working in the midday heat of the Tropics camp.
02/wsj_0214:The nagging memory of one afternoon fourteen years ago drove Jim Gideon, a lean 36-year-old righthander to take a four-month leave from selling insurance in Texas to try out for Mr. Weaver's team. 
02/wsj_0214:Some of the game's reigning philosophers dislike the idea of middle-aged men attempting a young man's sport. 
02/wsj_0214:Worse, says baseball author Lawrence Ritter, "Someone will get a heart attack and that will be the end of the whole story." 
02/wsj_0214:"It's going to be a tough league," promises the 47-year-old Mr. Campaneris. "There will be a lot of malice." Men who have played hard all their lives aren't about to change their habits, he says. 
02/wsj_0214:Still, "how sweet it is," he says, savoring the fat sound of the well-hit line drive that bounces off the center field wall. 
02/wsj_0214:And don't expect many complete games by pitchers -- perhaps three out of 288, laughs Mr. Fingers, the former Oakland reliever.
02/wsj_0214:Stuffing a wad of Red Man into his cheek, he admits the fastball he brought into the majors in 1955 has become a slowball.
02/wsj_0215:Alltel Corp. said it will acquire the 55% of Pond Branch Telephone Company Inc. 's cellular franchise that it doesn't own already.
02/wsj_0215:Alltel holds 45% of the franchise, which has operations in Aiken, S.C., and Augusta, Ga.
02/wsj_0215:Alltel, which provides local telephone service in 25 states, said it exercised its right of first refusal following an offer from an undisclosed third party to acquire the majority position in the franchise. 
02/wsj_0217:Liberty National Bancorp said its acquisition of Florence Deposit Bank, Florence, Ky., first announced in April, has been completed in a transaction valued at $13.1 million. 
02/wsj_0217:Liberty National exchanged about 78.64 shares of its common stock for each of Florence Deposit's 5,600 shares outstanding. 
02/wsj_0218:Hani Zayadi was appointed president and chief executive officer of this financially troubled department store chain, effective Nov. 15, succeeding Frank Robertson, who is retiring early.

02/wsj_0222:The company said its People's Savings Bank unit doesn't have a "large exposure to construction and commercial loans that have caused the loan-loss problems in many of the banks." 
02/wsj_0224:In a surprise move, the British government cleared the way for a bidding war for Jaguar PLC by agreeing to remove an obstacle to a takeover of the auto maker. 
02/wsj_0224:Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley told the House of Commons yesterday that he will relinquish the government's so-called golden share in the company as long as Jaguar shareholders agree.
02/wsj_0224:The golden share restricts any individual holding to 15% and expires at the end of 1990.
02/wsj_0224:It was in Jaguar's best interests "for the company's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible," Mr. Ridley said. 
02/wsj_0224:GM has been negotiating a friendly transaction with Jaguar that likely would involve joint ventures and an eventual stake of just under 30%. 
02/wsj_0224:But the government's action, which caught Jaguar management flat-footed, may scuttle the GM minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of Jaguar. "I can't believe they (GM) will let Ford have a free run," said Stephen Reitman, a European auto industry analyst at UBS-Phillips & Drew. "I am sure they will be going for a full bid." 
02/wsj_0224:In late trading, the shares were up a whopping 122 pence ($1.93) -- a 16.3% gain -- to a record 869 pence on very heavy volume of 9.7 million shares.
02/wsj_0224:Analysts expect Ford will make the first move, perhaps today, with an initial offer of about 900 pence ($14.25) a share.
02/wsj_0224:The share price was languishing at about 400 pence before Ford's Sept. 19 announcement of its interest in a minority stake. 
02/wsj_0224:Because of their longstanding rivalry, GM just "wants to make sure Ford pays a huge packet for (Jaguar)," said John Lawson, an auto analyst at London's Nomura Research Institute. 
02/wsj_0224:In a statement, Jaguar's board said they "were not consulted about the (Ridley decision) in advance and were surprised at the action taken." The statement emphasized that holders representing 75% of the shares voting at a special shareholders' meeting must agree to lift the takeover restrictions.
02/wsj_0224:U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid.
02/wsj_0224:Jaguar's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened, analysts add, because fewer than 3% of its shares are owned by employees and management. 
02/wsj_0224:But GM officials said they, too, were surprised by the move, which left them to "consider all our options and explore matters further." Although GM has U.S. approval to buy up to 15% of Jaguar's stock, it hasn't yet disclosed how many shares it now owns. 
02/wsj_0224:In a prepared statement, GM suggested its plans for Jaguar would be more valuable in the long run than the initial windfalls investors might reap from a hostile Ford bid. "Our intensive discussions with Jaguar, at their invitation," GM said, "have as their objectives to create a cooperative business relationship with Jaguar that would provide for the continued independence of this great British car company, to ensure a secure future for its employees and to provide an attractive long-term return for its shareholders." 
02/wsj_0224:Mr. Ridley's announcement set off a howl of protests from members of the opposition Labor Party, who accused the Thatcher administration of backing down on promised protection for a privatized company.
02/wsj_0224:The Conservative government's decision may reflect its desire to shed a politically sensitive issue well before the next election, expected in late 1991. "It's now a very good time politically to get this over and done with," observed Daniel Jones, professor of motor industry management at the University of Cardiff in Wales.
02/wsj_0224:Mr. Ridley hinted at this motive in answering questions from members of Parliament after his announcement.
02/wsj_0225:Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich., and Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, said they completed the formation of Dow Elanco, a joint venture combining their plant-sciences businesses as well as Dow's industrial pest-control business. 
02/wsj_0225:The companies said Dow Elanco will be the largest research-based agricultural concern in North America, with projected first-year revenue of $1.5 billion.
02/wsj_0225:Dow will own 60% of the venture, with Eli Lilly holding the rest.

02/wsj_0227:Erwin Tomash, the 67-year-old founder of this maker of data communications products and a former chairman and chief executive, resigned as a director.
02/wsj_0227:Under the circumstances, Dataproducts said, Mr. Tomash said he was unable to devote the time required because of other commitments.
02/wsj_0228:Robert Q. Marston, president emeritus, University of Florida, and a director of this maker of medical devices, was named chairman.
02/wsj_0229:SFE Technologies said William P. Kuehn was elected chairman and chief executive officer of this troubled electronics parts maker. 
02/wsj_0229:Mr. Kuehn, the company said, will retain the rest of the current management team. 
02/wsj_0229:For the nine months ended July 29, SFE Technologies reported a net loss of $889,000 on sales of $23.4 million.
02/wsj_0229:That compared with an operating loss of $1.9 million on sales of $27.4 million in the year-earlier period. 
02/wsj_0230:Sales of new cars in Europe fell 4.2% in September from a year earlier and analysts say the market could continue to soften in the months ahead. 
02/wsj_0230:After a stronger-than-expected pace early this year, analysts say the market, after a series of sharp swings in recent months, now shows signs of retreating. 
02/wsj_0230:Statistics from 12 countries which normally account for 94% of non-communist Europe's passenger car sales showed new car registrations totaled 911,606 in September, down 21% from August and down 4.2% for the year to date. 
02/wsj_0231:In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 132.00 points to 35549.44.
02/wsj_0231:The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the First Section, which declined 5.16 on Monday, was up 16.05, or 0.60%, at 2692.65 on Tuesday. 
02/wsj_0231:First, he said, domestic interest rates are likely to stay at higher levels as increased anticipation of inflation followed rising consumer prices reported last week.
02/wsj_0231:The topic that attracted participants' attention was Mitsubishi Estate's purchase of 51% of Rockefeller Center Properties, announced late Monday in New York.
02/wsj_0231:Many of the morning-session winners turned out to be losers by afternoon. 
02/wsj_0231:In other stock-market news, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said that for the week ended Friday, the balance of margin buying rose 189.8 billion yen ($1.34 billion), to 7.160 trillion yen ($50.46 billion).
02/wsj_0231:The balance of short positions outstanding fell 159.7 billion yen, to 779.8 billion yen. 
02/wsj_0231:But trading was very sketchy, as investment decision makers remain wary from gyrations and upsets of recent weeks. 
02/wsj_0231:"Volume has been appalling," said a dealer at a British brokerage concern. "The market was dragged up by the scruff of its neck by Wall Street and by market makers getting caught short.
02/wsj_0231:Meanwhile, the broad-based Financial Times 100-share index added 30.4 points to end at 2142.6, while reaching its minimum of 2120.5 a half hour into the session. 
02/wsj_0231:Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Nicholas Ridley said later in the day that the government would abolish its golden share in Jaguar, the luxury auto maker being stalked by General Motors and Ford Motor. 
02/wsj_0231:The golden share was scheduled to expire at the beginning of 
02/wsj_0231:But although the golden share has been waived, a hostile bidder for Jaguar would still have to alter the British concern's articles of association which ban shareholdings of more than 15%.
02/wsj_0231:Jaguar shares closed at 869 pence, up 122 pence, on hefty turnover of 9.7 million shares. 
02/wsj_0231:As the London trading session drew to a close, the market was still listening to the parliamentary debate on the economy, with new Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major expected to clarify his approach to the British economy and currency issues. 
02/wsj_0231:Contributing to the market's reserved stance was the release later in the day of new data on the health of the U.S. economy, in the form of the U.S. index of leading indicators.
02/wsj_0231:Additionally, the end of the month position-squaring might have also played a minor role, traders said. 
02/wsj_0231:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
02/wsj_0232:A breakdown showed that food prices were the most active part of growth with a rise of 0.6%.
02/wsj_0232:He said summer drought problems that had hit several southern agricultural regions had stopped being a major source of price pressure in September. 
02/wsj_0233:Japan's index of leading indicators rose to 63.6 in August, above the so-called boom-or-bust line of 50 for the first time since May, the Economic Planning Agency said. 
02/wsj_0233:The leading index recovered from July's revised level of 36.6 on strong performances in consumer durables and machinery orders, among other factors, according to an agency spokeswoman. 
02/wsj_0234:Metromedia said its unit is the fifth-largest provider of long-distance communications service in the U.S., with projected 1989 revenue of more than $550 million. 
02/wsj_0235:South Korean consumer prices rose 5% in the first 10 months of this year, matching the government's target for the entire year, according to the Bank of Korea and the Economic Planning Board. 
02/wsj_0235:As a result, consumer prices for the first 10 months of 1989 surged by 5% and wholesale prices by 1.3%.
02/wsj_0236:Under terms of the three-year contract, Martin Marietta said it will make and install 267 of the new machines at 156 postal offices.
02/wsj_0236:The new machines are capable of sorting by zip code up to 10,000 large flat mail pieces, including magazines and parcels, an hour. 
02/wsj_0238:Yields on savings-type certificates of deposit dropped slightly in the week ended yesterday. 
02/wsj_0238:The average yield on a six-month CD of $50,000 or less was 7.90%, compared with 7.94% a week earlier.
02/wsj_0238:"This week was uneventful for the CD market," said Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote. "The major banks haven't even reacted to sharp rises in the three-month Treasury bill rates" in the past two weeks.
02/wsj_0238:The CD trend runs counter to the direction of short-term interest rates at the Treasury bill auction Monday.
02/wsj_0238:The average six-month bill was sold with a yield of 8.04%, up from 7.90%.
02/wsj_0238:Most yields on short-term jumbo CDs, those with denominations over $90,000, also moved in the opposite direction of Treasury bill yields.
02/wsj_0238:The average two-year and five-year jumbos were up 0.02 of a percentage point to 7.91% and 7.96%, respectively. 
02/wsj_0238:Among the major banks surveyed by Banxquote in six regions of the country, 8.33% is the highest yield available.
02/wsj_0238:It is offered by the flagship banks of New York's Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in the one-year maturity only.
02/wsj_0238:The yield is offered across a range of maturities at San Francisco's BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co.
02/wsj_0238:Just two weeks ago, BankAmerica's yields in many of those maturities was 8.61%. 
02/wsj_0239:I had to reach back to French 101 when the monsieur avec clipboard leaned over my shoulder during the coffee phase of dinner and asked whether I wanted to ride in a montgolfiere. 
02/wsj_0239:The man with the clipboard represented a halfhearted attempt to introduce a bit of les sportif into our itinerary.
02/wsj_0239:But as the French embody a Zen-like state of blase when it comes to athletics (try finding a Nautilus machine in Paris), my fellow conventioners were having none of it.
02/wsj_0239:The diners at my table simply lit more Gauloises and scoffed at the suggestion of interrupting a perfectly good Saturday morning to go golfing or even montgolfing (ballooning to you; the brothers Montgolfier, French of course, were the world's first hot-air balloonists). 
02/wsj_0239:Back in the U.S.A. this kind of chi-chi airborne activity wins heartwarmingly covetous responses.
02/wsj_0239:During the past 25 years, the number of balloonists (those who have passed a Federal Aviation Authority lighter-than-air test) have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand, with some estimates running as high as 10,000.
02/wsj_0239:Some 30 balloon shows are held annually in the U.S., including the world's largest convocation of ersatz Phineas Foggs -- the nine-day Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta that attracts some 800,000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloons, some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble Carmen Miranda, Garfield or a 12-story-high condom. (The condom balloon was denied official entry status this year.) 
02/wsj_0239:But in Epinal, a gray 16th-century river town adjacent to France's Vosges mountain region, none of these Yankee-come-lately enthusiasms for things aloft was evident.
02/wsj_0239:Ballooning at the de rigueur hour of 6 a.m. held all the attraction for most people of sunrise root-canal work.
02/wsj_0239:Feeling the naggings of a culture imperative, I promptly signed up. 
02/wsj_0239:The first thing anybody will tell you about ballooning is that it requires zip in the way of athletic prowess, or even a measure of derring-do. (So long as you don't look down.) They will also tell you that even if you hate heights, you can still balloon. (I still say don't look down.
02/wsj_0239:To wit, my maiden voyage (and novitiates are referred to as virgins) began at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field. (Balloon flights almost always occur at dawn or dusk, when the winds are lightest.) In between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the balloons inflate and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order (the baskets hold no more than four passengers).
02/wsj_0239:After long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the Vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the French cows amble about the fields.
02/wsj_0239:It's hard not to feel that God's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world, even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how "belle" it all was.
02/wsj_0239:Eventually little French farmers and their little French farmwives came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us. 
02/wsj_0239:See, the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you can't steer.
02/wsj_0239:You can go only up or down (by heating the balloon's air with a propane burner, which does make the top of your head feel hot) and ride the air currents.
02/wsj_0239:When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion.
02/wsj_0239:"What's he doing?" hissed my companion, who was the only other English-speaking member of the convention and whose knuckles were white. "Attention," yelled our pilot as our basket plunged into the canal. "You bet attention," I yelled back, leaping atop the propane tanks, "I'm wearing alligator loafers!" Our pilot simply laughed, fired up the burner and with another blast of flame lifted us, oh, a good 12-inches above the water level.
02/wsj_0239:Eventually we came to rest in a soggy patch of field where we had the exquisite pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the mud while the French half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in.
02/wsj_0239:Back in the chase car, we drove around some more, got stuck in a ditch, enlisted the aid of a local farmer to get out the trailer hitch and pull us out of the ditch.
02/wsj_0239:We finally rendezvoused with our balloon, which had come to rest on a dirt road amid a clutch of Epinalers who watched us disassemble our craft -- another half-an-hour of non-flight activity -- that included the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground, punching all the air out of it, rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer.
02/wsj_0239:A whole morning of ballooning and I had been off the ground barely 30 minutes.
02/wsj_0240:Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford defended the Treasury's efforts this fall to drive down the value of the dollar, saying it helped minimize damage from the 190-point drop in the stock market Oct. 13. 
02/wsj_0240:Mr. Mulford, responding to critics of intervention, also said intervention is "highly visible," is taken seriously by financial markets and works better than "was recognized some time ago." 
02/wsj_0240:Differences between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve on the usefulness of intervention to help restrain the dollar resurfaced at the hearing.
02/wsj_0240:Mr. Mulford said reports of tension between the Treasury and Fed have been exaggerated, insisting that they involved "nuances." Mr. Johnson also said that "in the scheme of things, these things are minor." 
02/wsj_0240:On other matters, Mr. Mulford said West Germany is contributing to imbalances in the world economy because of its success as an exporter. "The solution is stronger domestic growth {in Germany}," he said.
02/wsj_0240:But because the growth of the German economy has been stronger than expected, Mr. Mulford said, it's difficult for the U.S. to argue that Germany ought to adopt more stimulative monetary and fiscal policies. 
02/wsj_0241:Five officials of this investment banking firm were elected directors: E. Garrett Bewkes III, a 38-year-old managing director in the mergers and acquisitions department; Michael R. Dabney, 44, a managing director who directs the principal activities group which provides funding for leveraged acquisitions; Richard Harriton, 53, a general partner who heads the correspondent clearing services; Michael Minikes, 46, a general partner who is treasurer; and William J. Montgoris, 42, a general partner who is also senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer.
02/wsj_0242:Some U.S. allies are complaining that President Bush is pushing conventional-arms talks too quickly, creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of Western Europe for years. 
02/wsj_0242:Concerns about the pace of the Vienna talks -- which are aimed at the destruction of some 100,000 weapons, as well as major reductions and realignments of troops in central Europe -- also are being registered at the Pentagon.
02/wsj_0242:But some American defense officials believe the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should take more time to examine the long-term implications of the options being considered. 
02/wsj_0242:At the same time, they contend that a reduction of NATO forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless the West retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in Europe. 
02/wsj_0242:Allies concerned about the deadline include the British, French and smaller NATO allies, some of whom don't have adequate staffs to provide quick answers to the questions being raised by what generally are considered the most complex arms-control talks ever attempted. 
02/wsj_0242:But even though NATO negotiators have only 10 months left under the Bush timetable, they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as "What is a tank?" Five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation haven't even been defined. 
02/wsj_0242:France, Britain and Italy all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks.
02/wsj_0242:Greece and Turkey, for example, are suspected of overstating their arsenals in hopes that they can emerge from the arms-reduction treaty with large remaining forces to deter each other. 
02/wsj_0242:"So what if you miss 50 tanks somewhere?" asks Rep. Norman Dicks (D., Wash.), a member of the House group that visited the talks in Vienna. "The bottom line is that if we can get that {Warsaw Pact} superiority brought down to parity, we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible.
02/wsj_0243:The value of the jets, including spares, is in excess of $250 million. 
02/wsj_0243:Two of the 757-200s are new aircraft to be delivered to American Trans Air, the main subsidiary of Amtran Inc., in December 1991 and January 1992.
02/wsj_0243:Four of the planes were purchased by International Lease from Singapore Airlines in a previously announced transaction. 
02/wsj_0243:Delivery of the first aircraft is set for early November, a second for December and two for April 1990. 
02/wsj_0244:Including those in the state programs, there were 143,800 Norwegians, or about 6.5% of the work force, without permanent employment in October, up from September's 136,800. 
02/wsj_0244:The number of people registered as jobless at the end of October declined by 900 from September to 78,600.
02/wsj_0245:The venture would be the latest in Coke's rapid expansion of overseas investment.
02/wsj_0245:Aside from Europe, the Pacific division is where Coke will be focusing much of its attention for years to come. 
02/wsj_0245:And unlike Europe and the U.S., where populations are aging, the Pacific Basin countries have growing proportions of youths -- the heaviest consumers of Coca-Cola and other sodas. 
02/wsj_0245:That doesn't appear to be the case in Singapore, a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft-drink consumption rate -- a key indicator of Coke's success in a market.
02/wsj_0245:In Singapore, per-capita consumption is about one-third that of the U.S.
02/wsj_0245:And combining Fraser & Neave's own soft drinks with Coca-Cola's gives the Singapore company more than half the share of the soda market there, Coke said. 
02/wsj_0245:Coke could be interested in more quickly developing some of the untapped potential in those markets.
02/wsj_0245:A Coke spokesman said he couldn't say whether that is the direction of the talks. 
02/wsj_0246:AMERICAN BRANDS Inc., Old Greenwich, Conn., said it increased its quarterly 11% to 68 cents a share from 61 cents, payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10.
02/wsj_0246:The increase follows the company's report of strong earnings for the third quarter, and reflects what American Brands called its "tradition of sharing earnings growth" with shareholders.
02/wsj_0246:As of Sept. 30, American Brands had 95.2 million shares outstanding. 
02/wsj_0247:Giovanni Agnelli & Co. announced a transaction that will strengthen its indirect control of Fiat S.p.
02/wsj_0247:Giovanni Agnelli, a limited partnership that is the master holding company for Fiat's Agnelli family, owns approximately 75% of the shares in Istituto Finanziario Industriale, which in turn owns approximately 40% of Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector industrial group. 
02/wsj_0247:The company said Maria Sole Agnelli Teodorani, sister of Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli, agreed to trade her shares in IFI for new ordinary shares in the limited partnership, which will give her control of 4.67% of Giovanni Agnelli & Co. 
02/wsj_0247:The Aga Khan, meanwhile, agreed to trade some of his stake in Luxembourg-based Ifint S.A., another Agnelli family company, for 7.45% of Giovanni Agnelli & Co. 's capital.
02/wsj_0247:His new stake would be in the form of preferred shares, which receive higher dividends but have voting rights only in extraordinary shareholders assemblies.
02/wsj_0247:The Aga Khan owns 10% of Ifint's capital, while IFI owns 23%. 
02/wsj_0247:As a result of the transaction, which is expected to be approved at a shareholders meeting Nov. 24, Giovanni Agnelli & Co. will control 79.18% of IFI's ordinary shares.
02/wsj_0247:The value of the two transactions wasn't disclosed, but an IFI spokesman said no cash would change hands. 
02/wsj_0247:The move strengthens the existing links between the Agnellis and the Aga Khan, the head of the world's Ismaili Moslems who is a longtime family friend and frequently goes sailing with Mr. Agnelli. 
02/wsj_0247:Giovanni Agnelli & Co., which was formed in January 1987 as a way of keeping the Agnellis' controlling stake in Fiat together despite an ever-growing family tree, has been playing a more active role in the Agnelli group of late. 
02/wsj_0247:It raised financing of 300 billion lire for the purchase this summer by another Agnelli-related group of the food concern Galbani S.p.
02/wsj_0247:A., by selling a chunk of its IFI shares to Mediobanca S.p.
02/wsj_0250:The compromise was a somewhat softened version of what the White House had said it would accept.
02/wsj_0250:White House officials were delighted that the compromise includes the concept of a training wage, which Mr. Bush has fought for throughout the year. 
02/wsj_0250:"For the first time in history, we have a training wage that will be part" of the nation's labor laws, said Roger Porter, assistant to the president for economic and domestic policy. 
02/wsj_0250:White House aides said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training wage, the final minimum-wage increase will meet the standards set by Mr. Bush. 
02/wsj_0250:Mr. Bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $4.25 an hour by the end of 1991, coupled with a six-month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer.
02/wsj_0250:Democrats argued that the training wage was a way of allowing employers to pay less than the minimum wage, while new workers need far less than six months to be trained for their jobs. 
02/wsj_0250:In the Senate, Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Labor Committee, and Pete Domenici, (R., N.M.) ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, have been working on a compromise, and their soundings showed that the Senate appeared to be heading toward enough strength to override another Bush veto, a Democratic staff official said. 
02/wsj_0250:Rep. Austin Murphy (D., Pa.), chairman of the House labor standards subcommittee, said they might have done better "if we'd held their feet to the fire." Mr. Kennedy suggested Democrats "yielded a great deal" on the size of the increase, but he cited concessions from the White House on the training wage, which he said make it "less harsh." 
02/wsj_0250:With only 16-year-olds to 19-year-olds eligible, 68% of workers getting less than $4.25 an hour, who are adults, won't be subject to the training wage, he said.
02/wsj_0251:Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings on about $3.2 billion of Houston Lighting & Power Co. 's securities because of the company's low levels of interest coverage and internal cash generation. 
02/wsj_0251:Houston Lighting is a unit of Houston Industries Inc., a utility holding company in Houston. 
02/wsj_0251:Downgraded by Moody's were Houston Lighting's first-mortgage bonds and secured pollution-control bonds to single-A-3 from single-A-2; unsecured pollution-control bonds to Baa-1 from single-A-3; preferred stock to single-A-3 from single-A-2; a shelf registration for preferred stock to a preliminary rating of single-A-3 from a preliminary rating of single-A-2; two shelf registrations for collateralized debt securities to a preliminary rating of single-A-3 from a preliminary rating of single-A-2, and the unit's rating for commercial paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1. 
02/wsj_0251:Moody's said Houston Lighting's current situation has some positive aspects, including managing "very well" the construction and commercial operation risks of Units 1 and 2 of the South Texas Project nuclear power plant.
02/wsj_0252:Scott C. Smith, formerly vice president, finance, and chief financial officer of this media concern, was named senior vice president.
02/wsj_0252:Mr. Smith, 39, retains the title of chief financial officer. 
02/wsj_0253:Armstrong, which has faced a takeover threat from the Belzberg family of Canada since July, said that disposing of the carpet business would improve "total financial performance." The move also would allow the company to concentrate on core businesses, which include ceramic tile, floor coverings and furniture. 
02/wsj_0253:Analysts expect Armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt, buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition. 
02/wsj_0253:The carpet division had 1988 sales of $368.3 million, or almost 14% of Armstrong's $2.68 billion total revenue.
02/wsj_0253:For the past year or two, the carpet division's operating profit margins have hovered around 5%, high by industry standards, but disappointing compared with the 13% to 19% margins for two of Armstrong's chief businesses, flooring and building products. 
02/wsj_0253:Shaw, based in Dalton, Ga., has annual sales of about $1.18 billion, and has economies of scale and lower raw-material costs that are expected to boost the profitability of Armstrong's brands, sold under the Armstrong and Evans-Black names. 
02/wsj_0253:Yesterday, Armstrong reported flat earnings for the third quarter and nine months, worsened by the stock dilution of an employee stock ownership plan adopted earlier this year. 
02/wsj_0253:For the quarter, earnings were $47 million, or 92 cents a share, including a one-time gain of $5.9 million.
02/wsj_0253:Yesterday, Armstrong announced an agreement to sell its small Applied Color Systems unit to a subsidiary of the Swiss company, Brauerei Eichof Ltd.
02/wsj_0253:Armstrong expects to close the sale of the color unit in late November and the carpet sale in December, with the gains to be applied to fourth quarter or first-quarter results. 
02/wsj_0254:The small increase in the index of leading indicators, which had climbed 0.5% in August but was unchanged in July, does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed noticeably.
02/wsj_0254:However, it doesn't give much of a clue as to whether a recession is on the horizon. 
02/wsj_0254:So far this year, the index of leading indicators has risen in four months, fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month. 
02/wsj_0254:In another report yesterday, the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family houses plunged 14% in September to an annual rate of 618,000 from 719,000 in August.
02/wsj_0254:So far this year, 534,000 newly built homes have been sold, down 4.5% from the like months of 1988. 
02/wsj_0254:The index of leading indicators got a major boost in September from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the University of Michigan.
02/wsj_0254:The Commerce Department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index, the influence of this component has been reduced. 
02/wsj_0254:Of the 11 components to the index, only three others rose in September: the money supply, the length of the average work week and stock prices. 
02/wsj_0254:Several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in September.
02/wsj_0254:These include new orders for manufactured consumer goods, lead times on vendor deliveries, orders for new plant and equipment, and backlogs of orders for durable goods. 
02/wsj_0254:Meanwhile, the National Association of Manufacturers said yesterday a recent poll of 53 executives on its board found that 61% don't expect a recession to occur until 1991 or later.
02/wsj_0254:Although manufacturers often are quick to call for lower interest rates, 60% of the executives said they would prefer that the Fed keep inflation-fighting as its top priority even if that means higher rates.
02/wsj_0254:Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators.
02/wsj_0255:The charge resulted from a settlement approved yesterday by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
02/wsj_0255:As expected, the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station to that plant's performance. 
02/wsj_0255:In its order, the state regulatory agency said the company "must be held accountable for the mistakes made in the management of the plant's operation." Pilgrim had been closed for 32 months. 
02/wsj_0256:The average interest rate rose to 8.3875% at Citicorp's $50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper, or corporate IOUs, from 8.337% at last week's sale. 
02/wsj_0256:Citicorp also said that the average rate rose to 8.0087% at its $50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper from 7.962% at last week's sale. 
02/wsj_0257:He is 37, an astronomer with impressive credentials, and something of a genius at making computers do his bidding.
02/wsj_0257:He once described himself as a "Berkeley Hippie," and played the role well; obligatory ragged jeans, a thicket of long hair and rejection of all things conventional, including, for a time at least, formal marriage to his "sweetheart," Martha Matthews.
02/wsj_0257:He also is an entertaining writer, combining wisecracks and wordplay with programmatic detail and lucid explanations of how computers work.
02/wsj_0257:In "The Cuckoo's Egg" (Doubleday, 326 pages, $19.95), he spins a remarkable tale of his efforts over 18 months to catch a computer spy. 
02/wsj_0257:The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans, accused of stealing information from computers in the U.S. and Europe and selling it to the Soviet KGB.
02/wsj_0257:One of them, 25-year-old Markus Hess of Hannover, allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than 30 high-security computers in the U.S., searching for secrets.
02/wsj_0257:He probably didn't penetrate any top-secret files, but the KGB in East Berlin was willing to pay two of his associates, Peter Carl and Dirk Brezinski, $15,000 for some of the material Hess collected.
02/wsj_0257:Mr. Stoll draws his title from the cuckoo's habit of laying eggs in the nests of other birds, making them surrogate parents.
02/wsj_0257:Mr. Stoll was scanning the heavens at the Keck observatory of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1986 when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the lab's computers.
02/wsj_0257:Mr. Stoll suspected the intruder was one of those precocious students who has fun breaking into computers. 
02/wsj_0257:He made a midnight requisition of all the printers he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the lab's computers.
02/wsj_0257:After discovering that the hacker had taken over the dormant account of a legitimate user named Joe Sventek, he rigged up an alarm system, including a portable beeper, to alert him when Sventek came on the line.
02/wsj_0257:His boss complained about neglect of other chores. 
02/wsj_0257:The hacker was pawing over the Berkeley files but also using Berkeley and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies.
02/wsj_0257:One of its international specialists, Steve White, took a quick interest in Mr. Stoll's hunt, ultimately tracing the hacker to West Germany.
02/wsj_0257:He savored the humor of his uncombed appearance among these buttoned-up chaps.
02/wsj_0257:He had developed a hatred for the hacker and a grudging appreciation of the federal "spooks" who make national security their business.
02/wsj_0257:Mr. Melloan is deputy editor of the Journal. 
02/wsj_0258:At that price, an analyst familiar with the machine said, the computer offers up to 10 times the performance of similar machines. "In the price range it's a tremendously high-performing product," said Sandy Gant, an analyst at the market-research firm InfoCorp. 
02/wsj_0258:The machine is part of an effort by Mips to establish itself as a supplier of computers, not just of integrated-circuit technology.
02/wsj_0258:For Mips, which expects revenue of $100 million this year, big-name allies such as Control Data are essential to attract software developers to the company's RISC architecture. "The thing it says about Mips is that they're on a roll right now," said Ms. Gant at InfoCorp. "They're getting some major wins," she added. 
02/wsj_0258:Last month, for example, Mips agreed to supply its computers to Nixdorf Computer AG of West Germany and France's Groupe Bull.
02/wsj_0258:Today's agreement gives Control Data a machine to compete against Digital and other general-purpose computer makers, said John Logan, a computer-market analyst at Aberdeen Group Inc. of Boston.
02/wsj_0258:Control Data, based in Minneapolis, Minn., expects its sales of Mips systems, including the new RC6280, to amount to more than $100 million by the end of 1991, Mips said.
02/wsj_0258:Nixdorf, Bull and others will also sell versions of the machine, said Mips President Robert Miller. 
02/wsj_0258:Mips will start shipping its new machine in the first quarter of 1990, he said.
02/wsj_0259:In a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee, the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office, which both are arms of Congress, advised the new S&L bailout agency to abandon plans to raise temporary working capital through debt issued from an agency that wouldn't be counted on the federal budget. 
02/wsj_0259:Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout. 
02/wsj_0259:The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold.
02/wsj_0259:The new S&L law allows the RTC to issue notes for as much as 85% of the value of the assets it holds. 
02/wsj_0259:But higher interest rates paid on off-budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs, and wouldn't be subject to congressional scrutiny, Ways and Means members argued. "To allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible," said Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.), who has introduced a bill to limit the RTC's authority to issue debt. 
02/wsj_0259:The RTC will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years.
02/wsj_0259:Then the short-term debt is paid off through the proceeds of selling the assets. 
02/wsj_0259:David Mullins, assistant secretary of the Treasury, said that the working capital is necessary to reduce the final costs of the bailout, by allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets, then hold the assets until they can be sold under favorable conditions. 
02/wsj_0260:Panhandle Eastern Corp. said it applied, on behalf of two of its subsidiaries, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to build a 352-mile, $273 million pipeline system from Pittsburg County, Okla., to Independence, Miss. 
02/wsj_0261:Not a gripping question, unless you're the pastry chef of this city's Chez Panisse restaurant and you've just lost your priceless personal dessert notebook. 
02/wsj_0261:The tattered black binder, bulging with 18 years' worth of recipes held together by rubber bands, was in chef Lindsey Shere's purse when it was stolen from her house recently. 
02/wsj_0261:Chez Panisse, whose founder, Alice Waters, is considered the inventor of the cooking style known as California cuisine and whose patrons make reservations a month in advance, hasn't exactly subjected diners to vanilla ice cream because of the theft.
02/wsj_0261:For one thing, Ms. Shere can draw on her cookbook, published by Random House four years ago, which is teeming with recipes for such specialties as kiwi sherbet, gooseberry fool (a creamy dish made with crushed stewed berries) and hazelnut "oeufs a la neige." For another, sympathetic fans have sent Ms. Shere copies of her recipes clipped from magazines over the years. 
02/wsj_0261:Still, the restaurant's ever-changing menu of five-course dinners -- it supposedly hasn't repeated a meal since opening in 1971 -- requires constant improvisation.
02/wsj_0261:Many in the Bay Area's pastry community express disbelief that Ms. Shere kept only one copy of such valuable notes, but she has received moral support from Baker's Dozen, a group of California pastry chefs that meets regularly to discuss issues like how to keep meringues from weeping and how bovine eating habits affect butter texture. 
02/wsj_0261:Ms. Shere has offered a $500 reward for the book's return but figures she'll have to reinvent many recipes from scratch. "It's an overwhelming job," she says. "There are so many possible proportions when you consider how many things are made out of eggs and butter and milk." 
02/wsj_0262:Newport Electronics Inc. named a new slate of officers, a move that follows replacement of the company's five incumbent directors last week. 
02/wsj_0262:Mr. Hollander's Stamford, Conn.-based High Technology Holding Co. acquired most of its 49.4% stake in Newport in August.
02/wsj_0262:Scott Wakeman was named president and chief operating officer of U.S. operations, titles that had been held by Mr. Weekes.
02/wsj_0262:Mr. Wakeman was vice president of the instrument and controls division of closely held Omega Engineering Inc., another company controlled by Mr. Hollander.
02/wsj_0262:James R. Lees, 51, vice president of Newport's European operations, was named executive vice president and chief operating officer of European operations, assuming some former duties of Mr. Weekes. 
02/wsj_0262:Arthur B. Crozier, 34, an attorney, was named secretary, succeeding John Virtue, who was another of the ousted directors. 
02/wsj_0263:The split and quarterly dividend will be payable Jan. 3 to stock of record Nov. 16, the company said.
02/wsj_0263:The split will raise the number of shares outstanding to about 10.2 million.
02/wsj_0264:Fibreboard Corp. said it completed the previously reported sale of approximately 27,500 acres of timberland near Truckee, Calif., to closely held Sierra Pacific Industries Corp., Arcata, Calif., for $32.5 million.
02/wsj_0264:The lumber, insulation and fireproofing concern said the transaction, which includes a swap of other timber interests, would result in a $13.5 million after-tax gain, to be recorded in the fourth quarter. 
02/wsj_0265:Under the agreement, Healthcare, a manager of health-care facilities, said it would pay HealthVest $3.9 million in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay $1.1 million in funds that HealthVest advanced for construction work on facilities.
02/wsj_0265:After the payment, Healthcare still will be $6.5 million in arrears on rent and mortgage payments to HealthVest, a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by Healthcare.
02/wsj_0265:In addition, Healthcare agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $2.7 million to $3 million to HealthVest during the standstill period, to be paid when Healthcare successfully completes asset sales.
02/wsj_0265:A spokesman said HealthVest has paid two of the three banks it owed interest to in October and is in negotiations with the third bank. 
02/wsj_0266:I was pleased to note that your Oct. 23 Centennial Journal item recognized the money-fund concept as one of the significant events of the past century.
02/wsj_0266:Actually, about two years ago, the Journal listed the creation of the money fund as one of the 10 most significant events in the world of finance in the 20th century.
02/wsj_0266:But the Reserve Fund, America's first money fund, was not named, nor were the creators of the money-fund concept, Harry Brown and myself.
02/wsj_0266:We innovated telephone redemptions, daily dividends, total elimination of share certificates and the constant $1 pershare pricing, all of which were painfully thought out and not the result of some inadvertence on the part of the SEC. 
02/wsj_0267:The crowning moment in the career of Joseph F. O'Kicki came as 300 local and state dignitaries packed into his elegant, marble-columned courtroom here last year for his swearing in as President Judge of Cambria County. 
02/wsj_0267:Baskets of roses and potted palms adorned his bench.
02/wsj_0267:To many, it was a ceremony more befitting a king than a rural judge seated in the isolated foothills of the southern Allegheny Mountains.
02/wsj_0267:While his case may be extreme, it reflects the vulnerability of many small communities to domineering judges. 
02/wsj_0267:Last March, nine months after the judge's swearing-in, the state attorney general's office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging more than 10 years of "official oppression" in Cambria County, a depressed steel and mining community in western Pennsylvania.
02/wsj_0267:Prosecutors, in an indictment based on the grand jury's report, maintain that at various times since 1975, he owned a secret and illegal interest in a beer distributorship; plotted hidden ownership interests in real estate that presented an alleged conflict of interest; set up a dummy corporation to buy a car and obtain insurance for his former girlfriend (now his second wife); and maintained 54 accounts in six banks in Cambria County. 
02/wsj_0267:One former bailiff charged that the judge double-crossed him by reneging on a promise of a better paying job after pocketing a $500 bribe. 
02/wsj_0267:Some of the allegations are simply bizarre.
02/wsj_0267:The judge, suspended from his bench pending his trial, which began this week, vehemently denies all the allegations against him, calling them "ludicrous" and "imaginative, political demagoguery." He blames the indictment on local political feuding, unhappiness with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse's docket and a vendetta by state investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his rulings against them. 
02/wsj_0267:Even if only some of the allegations stand up, however, they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities.
02/wsj_0267:That power can sometimes be abused, particularly since jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve as corrective measures in urban areas. 
02/wsj_0267:Fear of alienating that judge is pervasive, says Maurice Geiger, founder and director of the Rural Justice Center in Montpelier, Vt., a public interest group that researches rural justice issues. 
02/wsj_0267:The son of an immigrant stonemason of Slovenian descent, he was raised in a small borough outside Ebensburg, the Cambria County seat, and put himself through the University of Pittsburgh Law School.
02/wsj_0267:He graduated near the top of his class, serving on the school law review with Richard Thornburgh, who went on to become governor of Pennsylvania and, now, U.S. Attorney General.
02/wsj_0267:It was also in law school that Mr. O'Kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters.
02/wsj_0267:He divorced his first wife three years ago and married the daughter of his court clerk. 
02/wsj_0267:Last year, Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice John P. Flaherty called Mr. O'Kicki one of the finest judges "not only in Pennsylvania but in the United States." Clearly, the judge has had his share of accomplishments.
02/wsj_0267:Six years ago, Judge O'Kicki was voted president of the Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges by the state's 400 judges.
02/wsj_0267:And when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court seat in 1983, the Pennsylvania Bar Association rated him "one of the best available," after interviewing local lawyers. 
02/wsj_0267:"He probably was the smartest guy who ever sat on our bench," says a former president of Cambria County's 150-member bar association, who, like most lawyers in Cambria County, refuses to talk about the judge publicly. "He's sharp as a tack.
02/wsj_0267:He could grasp an issue with the blink of an eye." 
02/wsj_0267:For more than a decade, virtually no one complained about Judge O'Kicki. "What about those institutions that are supposed to be the bedrock of society, the banks and the bar association. . . ?" wrote a columnist for the Tribune-Democrat, a newspaper in nearby Johnstown, shortly after the scandal became public. "If only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out years ago, the judicial process wouldn't be under the taint it is today." 
02/wsj_0267:Officials with the Pennsylvania Judicial Inquiry and Review Board, the arm of the state that investigates judicial misconduct, counter that they had no inkling of anything amiss in Ebensburg. "Nobody told us; nobody called us," says an official close to the case who asked not to be named. "Nobody had the guts to complain." 
02/wsj_0267:Johnstown attorney Richard J. Green Jr. shelled out $500 in loans to the judge over five years, he said in testimony to the grand jury. "The judge never made a pretense of repaying the money," said Mr. Green.
02/wsj_0267:Eventually, Mr. Green testified, he began ducking out of his office rather than face the judge when he visited. 
02/wsj_0267:Mr. Green thought little of it, he told the grand jury, until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a kickback. 
02/wsj_0267:"Don't you think I ought to get a commission . . . or part of your fee in this case?" Mr. Green said the judge asked him. 
02/wsj_0267:Like most of Cambria County's lawyers and residents who had dealings with the judge, Mr. Green declined to be interviewed for this article.
02/wsj_0267:Says another lawyer: "The practice of law is a matter of biting one's lip when you live in a small community.
02/wsj_0267:One had best not dance on top of a coffin until the lid is sealed tightly shut." 
02/wsj_0267:Four years ago, he jailed all nine members of the Cambria County School Board for several hours after they defied his order to extend the school year by several weeks to make up for time lost during a teachers' strike. 
02/wsj_0267:The judge, they say, was fiercely proud of his abilities and accomplishments. 
02/wsj_0267:Yet, despite the judge's imperial bearing, no one ever had reason to suspect possible wrongdoing, says John Bognato, president of Cambria County's 150-member bar association. 
02/wsj_0267:"The arrogance of a judge, his demeanor, the way he handles people are not a basis for filing a complaint," says Mr. Bognato. "Until this came up and hit the press, there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong." 
02/wsj_0267:State investigators dispute that view now, particularly in light of the judge's various business dealings in Cambria County.
02/wsj_0267:The dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction pre-approved by Ebensburg's local lender, Laurel Bank. 
02/wsj_0267:It refinanced the judge's loan, lowered its interest rate and accepted a trade-in that hadn't originally been part of the deal -- a beat up 1981 Chevy Citation the dealer had to repair before it could be resold. 
02/wsj_0267:His seven-bedroom cedar and brick house outside of Johnstown is up for sale to pay for his lawyers. 
02/wsj_0267:Most of the allegations no longer pending were ethics charges withdrawn by state prosecutors as part of a pre-trial agreement.
02/wsj_0267:The heart of the case -- "official oppression" -- remains intact. 
02/wsj_0268:The use of the abominable construction practices in the Soviet Union -- as evidenced by the collapse of sand apartment blocks during the Armenian earthquake -- as a metaphor for the U.S. economic system was a sublime example of Mr. Cockburn's satirical muse. 
02/wsj_0268:I await his sequel: the economic and social resiliency of the San Francisco Bay area and the outstanding work of the local governments and the private charitable organizations there as metaphors for the supremacy of whatever failed system Mr. Cockburn now believes in.
02/wsj_0269:As a money manager and a grass-roots environmentalist, I was very disappointed to read in the premiere issue of Garbage that The Wall Street Journal uses 220,000 metric tons of newsprint each year, but that only 1.4% of it comes from recycled paper.
02/wsj_0269:With newspapers being the largest single component of solid waste in our landfills, and with our country overflowing with trash, all sectors of our society and all types of businesses must become more responsible in our use and disposal of precious natural resources. 
02/wsj_0269:Please make me and thousands of other readers more comfortable with our daily purchase of your newspaper by raising your environmental standards to your overall impeccable quality levels, and increase your use of recycled paper. 
02/wsj_0270:FIRST AMERICAN FINANCIAL Corp. declared a special dividend of one share of Class B common stock for each share of Class A common stock, payable to holders of record on Nov. 10 if the Securities and Exchange Commission approves this as the effective date of the registration statement.
02/wsj_0270:Shareholders of the Santa Ana, Calif., title-insurance company approved the creation of this second class of stock, which will be traded on the national over-the-counter market and which the company said would be used for acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. 
02/wsj_0271:Continental Cablevision Inc. -- $350 million of senior subordinated debentures, due Nov. 1, 2004, was priced at par to yield 12 7/8%.
02/wsj_0271:Beatrice Co. -- $251 million of notes, due Nov. 1, 1997, was priced in a two-part offering through underwriters at Salomon Brothers Inc.
02/wsj_0271:The size of the issue was scaled back from an originally planned $350 million.
02/wsj_0271:The first part, consisting of $151 million of 13 3/4% senior subordinated reset notes, was priced at 99.75.
02/wsj_0271:The rate on the notes will be reset annually to give the issue a market value of 101.
02/wsj_0271:The second part, consisting of $100 million of senior subordinated floating-rate notes, was priced at 99 3/4 to float 4.25% above the three-month London interbank offered rate.
02/wsj_0271:New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Trust -- $75.1 million, two-part offering of bonds apparently was won by a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group.
02/wsj_0271:The group's bid for $40.9 million of wastewater treatment insured bonds, Series 1989 A, produced a 7.0826% true interest cost.
02/wsj_0271:The group's bid for $34.2 million of wastewater treatment bonds, Series 1989 B, produced a 7.0808% true interest cost.
02/wsj_0271:Matagorda County Navigation District No. 1, Texas -- $70.3 million of pollution control revenue bonds (Houston Lighting & Power Co. Project), due Oct. 1, 2019, were tentatively priced by a Goldman, Sachs & Co. group at 98 1/4 to yield 7.649% with a coupon of 7 1/2%.
02/wsj_0271:Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. -- $500 million of Remic mortgage securities is being offered in 11 classes by a Morgan Stanley group.
02/wsj_0271:Lomas Mortgage Funding Corp. II -- $100 million issue of collateralized mortgage obligations is being offered in four classes by a Morgan Stanley group.
02/wsj_0271:The securities yield from 9.35% to 10.48% for a 30-year issue with an average life of 21.18 years.
02/wsj_0271:The 10.48% yield represents a spread to the 20-year Treasury of 2.45 percentage points.
02/wsj_0271:The collateral consists of collateralized whole loans with a weighted average coupon rate of 11.08% and weighted average remaining term to maturity of 28 years.
02/wsj_0271:The issue is 6% to 7% overcollateralized, and 75% of the loans are covered by a General Electric pool policy covering losses of as much as 10% of the original principal balance of the loans. 
02/wsj_0271:J.C. Penney Co. -- $350 million of JCP Master Credit Card Trust asset-backed certificates, Series B, with a final stated maturity of Oct. 15, 2001, was priced at 99.1875 to yield 9.192% with a coupon of 8.95%.
02/wsj_0271:The certificates, which have an average life of 10.05 years, were priced at 1.31 percentage points over the benchmark Treasury 10-year note.
02/wsj_0271:The issue is backed by a 12% letter of credit from Credit Suisse. 
02/wsj_0271:Keio Teito Electric Railway Co. (Japan) -- $300 million of bonds due Nov. 16, 1993, with equity-purchase warrants, indicating a 3 3/4% coupon at par via Nomura International Ltd.

02/wsj_0271:Each $5,000 bond carries one warrant, exercisable from Nov. 30 through Nov. 2, 1994, to buy company shares at an expected premium of 2 1/2% to the closing share price when terms are fixed Monday. 
02/wsj_0271:Chugoku Electric Power Co. (Japan) -- $150 million of 8 7/8% bonds due Nov. 29, 1996, priced at 101 7/8 to yield 8 7/8% less full fees via Nikko Securities Ltd. Fees 1 7/8.

02/wsj_0272:Dr. Berthold, a German maker of scientific instruments. 
02/wsj_0272:The Wellesley, Mass., maker of scientific instruments and electronic parts said Berthold expects 1989 sales of more than 100 million Deutsche marks ($54.5 million) and employs about 400 people.
02/wsj_0272:John M. Kucharski, EG&G's chairman and chief executive, said the acquisition "will extend EG&G's core technologies, strengthen its position in the European Economic Community and assure a strength and presence in the Eastern European market." He said it especially will strengthen the company's efforts in the rapidly growing field of bio-analytical instrumentation, and in applied nuclear physics. 
02/wsj_0272:Separately, EG&G said it sold most of its Mason Research Institute subsidiary to Transgenic Sciences Inc., a closely held biotechnology company based in Worcester, Mass.
02/wsj_0272:Mason is the largest toxicology lab in New England, with annual revenue of $8 million and 140 employees. 
02/wsj_0272:Mason serves commercial and government customers, including the National Institutes of Health.
02/wsj_0273:The surprise announcement came after the IRS broke off negotiations with Mr. Hunt on a settlement of the one-time tycoon's personal bankruptcy case.
02/wsj_0273:Although the action removes one obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case, it also means that Mr. Hunt could be stripped of virtually all of his assets if the Tax Court rules against him in a 1982 case heard earlier this year in Washington, D.C.
02/wsj_0273:The Peruvian minerals concern had been seeking a claim of $251 million against Mr. Hunt.
02/wsj_0273:In addition to turning down the compromise, Judge Harold C. Abramson said he would allow a claim of only $19.7 million.
02/wsj_0273:Regarding Mr. Hunt's taxes, he and the IRS have apparently agreed on a basic formula for liquidating his estate in which the IRS would get 70% of the proceeds from a liquidating trust and 30% would go to other creditors.
02/wsj_0274:An increasing number of big Japanese investors are buying up U.S. home mortgages that have been pooled and packaged for sale as interest-bearing instruments known as mortgage-backed securities.
02/wsj_0274:As much as 10% of new U.S. mortgage securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, now flow into Japanese hands. 
02/wsj_0274:"You can't say it's a "tsunami" (tidal wave), but we're making some headway," says Fannie Mae's chairman, David O. Maxwell, who visits Tokyo at least once a year to explain and drum up investor interest in mortgage securities. "Interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago." The steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the U.S. has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here. 
02/wsj_0274:Evidence of the growing Japanese demand for mortgage securities abounds.
02/wsj_0274:Industrial Bank of Japan, which claims to be the biggest Japanese buyer of U.S. mortgage securities, says it will more than double its purchases this year, to an amount one official puts at several billion dollars.
02/wsj_0274:And a Fannie Mae seminar this week promises to draw hundreds of prospective investors, who can be expected to channel tens of billions of dollars into the market in the next few years. 
02/wsj_0274:"Last year, there were only several big investors who were interested," says Kinji Kato, a vice president at the international arm of Nomura Securities Co. "This year, some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot." Ultimately, he says, strong demand could help to drive down interest rates on mortgage securities. 
02/wsj_0274:At the moment, Nomura is the only Japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of Fannie Mae instruments.
02/wsj_0274:While they aren't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, as Treasury bonds are, it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary. (U.S.
02/wsj_0274:Treasury bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term Japanese investors).
02/wsj_0274:The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $900 billion, or nearly half of the $2.2 trillion in U.S. residential mortgages issued.
02/wsj_0274:At the moment, some offer as much as 1.6 to 1.8 percentage points over Treasury securities of similar maturities. 
02/wsj_0274:Since most mortgages can be prepaid or refinanced at any time, issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity.
02/wsj_0274:As a result, Japanese investors steered clear of the mortgage securities. 
02/wsj_0274:Since 1985, Japanese investors have bought nearly 80% of $10 billion in Fannie Mae corporate debt issued to foreigners, money that Fannie Mae uses to buy mortgages from U.S. banks.
02/wsj_0274:And Japanese investors took up nearly all of two $200 million Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits, a kind of collateralized mortgage obligation, that were offered to foreigners this year. 
02/wsj_0274:In addition, further packaging of mortgage-backed securities, such as Blackstone's fund, have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions don't have to.
02/wsj_0274:Freddie Mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it won't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments. 
02/wsj_0275:As Georgia-Pacific's bid for Great Northern Nekoosa has shown, uninvited takeovers are still alive despite premature reports of their demise.
02/wsj_0275:Therefore, the debate about poison pills will continue to rage in the boardrooms of corporations and the halls of academia. 
02/wsj_0275:Although poison pills come in different colors and shapes, they usually give current shareholders the right to buy more stock of their corporation at a large discount if certain events occur -- typically, if a hostile bidder acquires more than a specified percentage of the corporation's stock.
02/wsj_0275:However, these discount purchase rights may generally be redeemed at a nominal cost by the corporation's directors if they approve of a bidder. 
02/wsj_0275:Supporters of poison pills argue that their adoption forces bidders to negotiate with a corporation's directors, who are thereby put in a better position to pursue the long-term interests of the corporation.
02/wsj_0275:Critics of poison pills argue that they harm shareholders by letting corporate management defeat takeover bids at premium prices and by deterring premium bids from ever being made to shareholders.
02/wsj_0275:These critics are backed by several academic studies showing that the adoption of poison pills reduces shareholder values not merely in the short run, but also over longer periods. 
02/wsj_0275:Will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry out this strategy? 
02/wsj_0275:The limit could range from three years to seven years, depending on the composition of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan.
02/wsj_0275:At the end of this period, the poison pill would be eliminated automatically, unless a new poison pill were approved by the then-current shareholders, who would have an opportunity to evaluate the corporation's strategy and management team at that time. 
02/wsj_0275:One rare example of a time-limited poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by Pennzoil last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from Texaco.
02/wsj_0275:The State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which owned about 7% of the company's voting stock, worked with management to devise a time-limited poison pill.
02/wsj_0275:This pill automatically expires after three years unless continued by a vote of the shareholders. 
02/wsj_0275:The attitude of the Wisconsin Investment Board reflects a growing receptivity to time-limited poison pills on the part of institutional investors, as shown by the discussions at recent meetings of the Council of Institutional Investors and my informal survey of several retirement plans with large stock positions. 
02/wsj_0275:More widespread time limits on poison pills would allow shareholders to evaluate a specific poison pill within the context of a specific management team's strategy.
02/wsj_0275:Mr. Pozen is the general counsel and a managing director of Fidelity Investments in Boston. 
02/wsj_0276:Michael Blair, former president and chief executive officer of Enfield Corp., failed to win election to the company's board at a special shareholder meeting. 
02/wsj_0276:Mr. Blair said after the meeting that he had filed separate lawsuits in the Ontario Supreme Court for unjust dismissal against Enfield and for libel against its largest shareholder, Canadian Express Ltd., and two executives of Hees International Bancorp Inc., which controls Canadian Express. 
02/wsj_0276:Holders at the meeting elected a full slate of Canadian Express nominees to Enfield's 11-member board. 
02/wsj_0276:Yesterday's election was a sequel to Enfield's annual meeting in June when Mr. Blair disallowed proxies in favor of two Hees nominees.
02/wsj_0277:Buying 51% of Rockefeller Group Inc. is right up Mitsubishi Estate Co. 's alley in one sense: The huge Japanese real estate company is entering a long-term relationship with a similarly conservative U.S. owner of tony urban property. 
02/wsj_0277:The usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that owns New York's beloved Rockefeller Center at a time when tensions over Japanese purchases of U.S. property are at an all-time high. 
02/wsj_0277:Officials of Rockefeller Group and Mitsubishi Estate prefer to focus on the affinities, nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the U.S. public. "We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions," says Raymond Pettit, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Rockefeller Group. "On balance, we think it will be positive." 
02/wsj_0277:But some Japanese government officials and businessmen worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being.
02/wsj_0277:In particular, they criticize the timing, coming as it does on the heels of Sony Corp. 's controversial purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. 
02/wsj_0277:"Officially, yes, we encourage the free flow of direct investment," says a Foreign Ministry official. "But they didn't have to choose this particular moment." 
02/wsj_0277:Since the mid-1980s, Japan's other major real estate purchases in the U.S. include Dai-Ichi Seimei America Corp. 's $670 million purchase of an office building at 153 East 53rd St. in Manhattan in 1987 and Mitsui Fudosan Inc. 's $610 million purchase of the Exxon Building, part of Rockefeller Center, in 1986.
02/wsj_0277:Critics say Mitsubishi Estate's decision to buy into Rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of Japan. "Those who have no money and aren't buying think it's right to refrain, but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention," says an official of the Japan-U.S.
02/wsj_0277:First of all, it is a friendly acquisition in which Rockefeller sought out Mitsubishi Estate and asked it to buy a majority share.
02/wsj_0277:Secondly, the two companies found a similarity in their business and development philosophies and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications.
02/wsj_0277:"We'll continue to work with them, in keeping with the reputation of the company, and we'll rely very much on their leadership," says Mitsubishi Estate President Jotaro Takagi. 
02/wsj_0277:Rockefeller may well have found its match in Mitsubishi Estate, a company of long history, strong government ties and sound resources.
02/wsj_0277:The core of its holdings is 190,000 square meters of incredibly expensive property in the Marunouchi district, the business and financial center of Tokyo, often jokingly called "Mitsubishi Village." 
02/wsj_0277:The Mitsubishi family company acquired that property from the government some 100 years ago when it was a portion of samurai residential land running from the moat of the Imperial Palace east toward the hodgepodge of tiny shops and twisted alleys that made up the merchants' district.
02/wsj_0277:At the time, Japan had just opened its doors to the world after about 250 years of isolation and needed a Western-style business center.
02/wsj_0277:That was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the Mitsubishi group the dubious moniker of "seisho," literally government-business, a title that has the pejorative connotation of doing the government's bidding, but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties. 
02/wsj_0277:Mitsubishi Estate is one of the dozens of companies in today's Mitsubishi group.
02/wsj_0277:It's known for its cautiousness in part because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures: In the year ended March 31, 57.4% of its total revenue came from office building management.
02/wsj_0277:Its earnings can rise 10% to 12% annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases, says Graeme McDonald, an industry analyst at James Capel Pacific Ltd.
02/wsj_0277:Mitsubishi Estate hasn't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase, which are due in cash next April, but the Marunouchi holdings alone are estimated to have a market value of as much as 10 trillion yen to 11 trillion yen.
02/wsj_0277:Moreover, as a member of the Mitsubishi group, which is headed by one of Japan's largest banks, it is sure to win a favorable loan.
02/wsj_0277:Meanwhile, at home, Mitsubishi has control of some major projects.
02/wsj_0277:It is the largest private-sector landowner of the Minato-Mirai 21 project, a multibillion-yen development in the port city of Yokohama, about an hour outside Tokyo.
02/wsj_0277:The project is one of a select group of public projects opened to U.S. firms under a U.S.-Japan construction trade agreement reached last year.
02/wsj_0277:The centerpiece of that complex, the Landmark Tower, will be Japan's tallest building when it is completed in 1993. 
02/wsj_0277:Mitsubishi is also pushing ahead with a controversial plan to redevelop Marunouchi into a business center of high-tech buildings, a project budgeted for 30 years and six trillion yen. 
02/wsj_0278:Time Warner Inc. and Sony Corp. may be today's public enemies, but the two entertainment giants could end up becoming partners in a number of ventures as part of a settlement of their acrimonious legal dispute over Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters. 
02/wsj_0278:Warner Communications Inc., which is being acquired by Time Warner, has filed a $1 billion breach-of-contract suit against Sony and the two producers.
02/wsj_0278:The two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks, and both Warner and Sony have accused each other of trying to sabotage each other's prospects for success in the entertainment business.
02/wsj_0278:Both Warner and Sony declined to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions.
02/wsj_0278:Instead, Sony is likely to agree to let Warner participate in certain of its businesses, such as the record club of Sony's CBS Records unit.
02/wsj_0278:In addition, Sony is expected to agree to swap Columbia's 35% stake in the sprawling Burbank, Calif., studio that Warner and Columbia share, in exchange for the old MGM studio lot that Warner acquired with the purchase of Lorimar Telepictures Corp. 
02/wsj_0278:Still, it may be tough for the two to have a smooth partnership in anything, in the wake of sworn affidavits filed over the last week.
02/wsj_0278:In his affidavit, Mr. Yetnikoff accused Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross of having an "antiSony, anti-Japanese bias" and said that Mr. Ross had tried to talk him out of letting Sony buy CBS Records two years ago for that reason. 
02/wsj_0278:Mr. Ross, who will be chairman and co-chief executive officer of Time Warner after the merger is complete, denied that in his own affidavit, and called Mr. Yetnikoff's remarks "vicious" and his claims "reckless, irresponsible and baseless," saying Warner under his leadership has started a number of businesses in Japan. 
02/wsj_0278:But despite the acrimony between Mr. Ross and Mr. Yetnikoff, officials of the Time side of Time Warner have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities.
02/wsj_0278:Time executives such as the company's president, N.J. Nicholas, who will eventually be co-chief executive of Time Warner alongside Mr. Ross, have no personal relationships or ego at stake in the fight over the Guber-Peters duo, and were never directly drawn into the fray. 
02/wsj_0278:Talks between the two sides could unravel, of course, as they have more than once since Sony announced its plans to hire Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters.
02/wsj_0278:And although Warner has said it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract, the producers said in sworn court declarations that they didn't believe the relationship could be repaired after the acrimony of the legal battle. 
02/wsj_0278:Any settlement is also expected to exclude Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from any of the projects they were working on at Warner.
02/wsj_0278:The Guber-Peters duo have 50 projects in various stages of development and production at Warner, including "Bonfire of the Vanities" and "A Bright Shining Lie." 
02/wsj_0278:But that doesn't mean Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects; studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only 10 to 20 each year.
02/wsj_0278:But in acquiring Guber-Peters Entertainment, Sony will actually get a piece of the profits from "Batman," since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters produce.
02/wsj_0279:Southern Co. 's Gulf Power Co. subsidiary pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions and tax evasion, and paid $500,000 in fines. 
02/wsj_0279:Gulf Power's guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Robert L. Vining yesterday marks the end of only one part of a wide-ranging inquiry of Southern Co.
02/wsj_0279:The company is the subject of a federal grand jury investigation into whether its officials and its utility subsidiaries conspired to cover up their accounting for spare parts to evade federal income taxes. 
02/wsj_0279:The plea settlement does not allow Southern Co. to charge any of the $500,000 to its customers, or take action against employees who provided information during the federal inquiry.
02/wsj_0279:Mr. Barr said yesterday's plea by Gulf Power, which came after months of negotiations, was based on evidence that Gulf Power had set up an elaborate payment system through which it reimbursed outside vendors -- primarily three Florida advertising agencies -- for making illegal political contributions on its behalf. 
02/wsj_0279:The contributions were funded by monthly payments of $1,000 to $2,000 to Appleyard in the guise of a "special production fee" -- in effect, hiding the nature of the payments from the Internal Revenue Service, federal prosecutors said. 
02/wsj_0279:The government also indicated that former Gulf Power senior vice president Jacob F. "Jake" Horton was the mastermind behind the use of the ad agencies -- Appleyard, Dick Leonard Group II Inc. and Hemmer & Yates Corp. -- to make payments to various political candidates from 1981 to 1988.
02/wsj_0279:Mr. Horton, who oversaw Gulf Power's governmental-affairs efforts, died mysteriously in a plane crash in April after learning he might be fired following the uncovering of irregularities in a company audit. 
02/wsj_0280:TO GRAB a bigger piece of the declining scotch market, Seagram Co. has launched a controversial "frequent drinker" promotion for its Chivas Regal brand. 
02/wsj_0280:But at a time of mounting concern over alcohol abuse, some liquor marketers consider Seagram's frequent buyer promotion risky. "I'm surprised they're doing this," says Penn Kavanagh, president of Schieffelin & Somerset Co., which markets Johnnie Walker scotches. "I would be very leery of anything that says if you drink more, you get more." 
02/wsj_0280:Others question the impact on Chivas's upscale image of a promotion that has customers soaking off labels. "It's really bizarre," says Albert Lerman, creative director at the Wells Rich Greene ad agency. "Chivas has an image of something you would savor, rather than guzzle." 
02/wsj_0280:But the scope of Seagram's Chivas promotion sets it apart.
02/wsj_0280:The current campaign is just the first leg of an aggressive three-to-five-year direct marketing plan. 
02/wsj_0280:Seagram asks customers to buy only two or three bottles over a 12-month period, says Richard Shaw, vice president of U.S. direct marketing. "We're not asking them to save up 50 proof-of-purchases.
02/wsj_0280:MOST FOOD companies these days are trimming the fat and cholesterol content of their products to appeal to health-conscious consumers.
02/wsj_0280:To give Leche Fresca the creamier taste Goya says Hispanics prefer, the new brand has a butterfat content of 3.8%.
02/wsj_0280:Goya is selling Leche Fresca in nearly 500 grocery stores and bodegas in New York and parts of New Jersey.
02/wsj_0280:Because of Leche Fresca's success, he says, the joint venture is developing other dairy products tailored to Hispanic tastes. 
02/wsj_0280:As a result, marketers of faux gems steadily lost space in department stores to more fashionable rivals -- cosmetics makers. 
02/wsj_0280:And jewelry makers are beginning to use many of the same marketing tricks honed in the aggressive world of cosmetics. 
02/wsj_0280:Last year, the total women's fashion jewelry business topped $4.9 billion, says Karen Alberg, editor of Accessories magazine.
02/wsj_0280:And it's growing fast, with annual sales gains of more than 10%. 
02/wsj_0280:To increase their share of that business, jewelry makers such as Crystal Brands Inc. 's Trifari and Monet units and Swank Inc., maker of Anne Klein jewelry, are launching new lines with as much fanfare as the fragrance companies.
02/wsj_0280:They're hiring models to stroll the aisles sporting their jewels, and they're even beginning to borrow a perennial favorite of the beauty business -- offering a gift when consumers make a purchase. 
02/wsj_0280:Trifari, whose national ads earlier this year included paper cutouts of its costume finery, takes a tamer approach.
02/wsj_0280:Procter & Gamble Co. recently introduced refillable versions of four products, including Tide and Mr. Clean, in Canada, but doesn't plan to bring them to the U.S. Marketers believe most Americans won't make the convenience trade-off. . . . Braumeisters Ltd. tests a beer brewed with oat bran, rather than rice or corn.
02/wsj_0280:No cholesterol, of course. 
02/wsj_0281:Northwest Airlines settled the remaining lawsuits filed on behalf of 156 people killed in a 1987 crash, but claims against the jetliner's maker are being pursued, a federal judge said. 
02/wsj_0281:Northwest, a unit of NWA Inc., and McDonnell Douglas Corp., which made the MD-80 aircraft, also are pursuing counterclaims against each other in the crash near Detroit Metropolitan Airport. 
02/wsj_0281:Terms of the settlements for the remaining 145 lawsuits against Northwest weren't disclosed.
02/wsj_0281:A total of 157 lawsuits were filed on behalf of crash victims. 
02/wsj_0281:The only passenger who survived the crash was Cecelia Cichan, then 4, of Tempe, Ariz., whose parents and brother died in the crash.
02/wsj_0282:Mr. Moon planned to convert millions of Americans to his unique brand of Christianity -- in which he plays the role of Old Testament-style temporal, political messiah -- and then to make the U.S. part of a unified international theocracy.
02/wsj_0282:That the membership number has even kept close to its 1976 size is the result of the "graying" of the church.
02/wsj_0282:Many of the enthusiastic young "Moonies" of the Nixon era who remained faithful to Father Moon are now parents, producing new members by procreation rather than conversion. 
02/wsj_0282:The reputed wealth of the Unification Church is another matter of contention.
02/wsj_0282:Most were obtained with huge inputs of church money from South Korea and Japan, minimum cash downpayments and sizable mortgages.
02/wsj_0282:Those teams of young fund-raisers selling flowers, peanuts or begging outright at traffic intersections brought in somewhere near $20 million a year during the mid-to-late 1970s, but those revenues were a pittance compared to the costs of Mr. Moon's lavish international conferences, speaking tours, and assorted land buys.
02/wsj_0282:Virginia Commonwealth University sociologist David Bromley, who more than any other researcher has delved into the complex world of Unificationist finances, has concluded that profitable operations in the U.S. have been the exceptions rather than the rule.
02/wsj_0282:Likewise, journalists John Burgess and Michael Isikoff of the Washington Post have estimated that at least $800 million was transferred from Japan to the U.S. to deal with the church's annual operating losses in this country. 
02/wsj_0282:Mr. Moon's two English-language U.S. newspapers illustrate the scope of this financial drain.
02/wsj_0282:Since then, Moon's organization has inaugurated a pair of high-quality glossy opinion magazines, The World and I and Insight, which are a further drain.
02/wsj_0282:Some components of the American church had their budgets cut in half last year and again this year.
02/wsj_0282:The relatively small academic conferences that have attracted conservative guests -- and press scrutiny -- in recent years are much more narrowly targeted and austere than the thousand-person get-togethers in fancy digs and exotic locales of years past.
02/wsj_0282:I attended several of these in the dual role as a presenter of research findings as well as an investigator of my hosts. (Mr.
02/wsj_0282:Moon's Paragon House eventually even published three of my co-edited books on religion and politics.) 
02/wsj_0282:According to veteran watchers of Unificationist affairs, such as Dr. J. Gordon Melton, director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion, almost all operations are being drastically reduced as Mr. Moon now concentrates more on developing his empire in the Far East. "Everything," one non-"Moonie" senior consultant to the Unification Church recently told me in an interview, "is going back to Korea and Japan." (Europe had proved even less hospitable than North America.
02/wsj_0282:Moon's Tong'Il industry conglomerate is now investing heavily in China, where church accountants have high hopes of expanding and attracting converts even in the wake of the bloody massacre in Tiananmen Square.
02/wsj_0282:According to senior consultants to the church, Mr. Moon has successfully negotiated a joint venture with the Chinese government to build an automobile-parts plant in Guangdong Province, an area of China with a substantial Korean minority.
02/wsj_0282:Mr. Shupe is co-author (with David G. Bromley) of "`Moonies' in America: Cult, Church, and Crusade" and "Strange Gods: The Great American Cult Scare." 
02/wsj_0283:The Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust said it is considering several ways to ease a liquidity crunch that could include the sale of Manville Corp. to a third party. 
02/wsj_0283:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the majority holder of Manville acknowledged that the cash portion of its initial funding of $765 million will be depleted next year, and that alternative sources of funds will be necessary to meet its obligations.
02/wsj_0283:The trust, which was created as part of Manville's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases, ultimately expects to receive $2.5 billion from Manville, but its cash flow from investments has so far lagged behind its payments to victims. 
02/wsj_0283:Spokespersons for both the trust and the company refused to comment on whether any talks with a possible acquirer of Manville had actually taken place.
02/wsj_0283:The trust is considering a sale of its Manville holdings, but Manville has the right of first refusal on any sales of its stock held by the trust. 
02/wsj_0283:Manville, a forest and building products concern, has offered to pay the trust $500 million for a majority of Manville's convertible preferred stock.
02/wsj_0283:The filing also said the trust is considering a sale of Manville securities in the open market; an extraordinary dividend on the common stock; or a recapitalization of Manville. 
02/wsj_0283:All are non-Russian republics along the southern border of the Soviet Union, and all but Kirgizia have reported rioting in the past six months. 
02/wsj_0283:The newspaper said it is past time for the Soviet Union to create unemployment insurance and retraining programs like those of the West. 
02/wsj_0283:Pravda gave no estimate for overall unemployment but said an "Association of the Unemployed" has cropped up that says the number of jobless is 23 million Soviets, or 17% of the work force. 
02/wsj_0283:An 11-week dispute involving Australia's 1,640 domestic pilots has slashed airline earnings and crippled much of the continent's tourist industry. "The only people who are flying are those who have to," said Frank Moore, chairman of the Australian Tourist Industry Association.
02/wsj_0283:He added: "How is a travel agent going to sell a holiday when he cannot guarantee a return flight?" Transport giant TNT, which owns half of one of the country's two major domestic carriers, said the cost of the dispute had been heavy, cutting TNT's profits 70% to $12 million in the three months to Sept. 30. 
02/wsj_0283:Mr. Nahas, who single-handedly provoked a one-day closure of Brazil's stock markets in June when he failed to honor a debt of $31.1 million owed to his brokers, yesterday blamed his predicament on the president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange; a few days before Mr. Nahas's failure, the exchange raised the required margin on stock-margin transactions. 
02/wsj_0283:Israeli officials confirmed that Energy Minister Moshe Shahal and his Canadian counterpart, Jake Epp, discussed a possible Israeli purchase of a $1.1 billion Canadian nuclear reactor for producing electricity.
02/wsj_0283:Israel has been accused in the past of using subterfuge to seek elements needed to develop nuclear weapons. 
02/wsj_0283:Earlier this year, Venezuela announced it was opening up debt-equity swaps to foreign investors but said the program would be limited to a net disbursement of $600 million a year.
02/wsj_0283:The office of foreign investment has authorized some $1.78 billion worth of investment proposals, said Edwin Perozo, superintendent of foreign investment.
02/wsj_0283:Most of the proposals are in tourism, basic industry and fishery and agro-industry projects, he said. 
02/wsj_0283:Under the debt-equity program, potential investors will submit sealed bids on the percentage of discount they are willing to purchase the debt at, and the bids will be allocated based on these discount offers.
02/wsj_0283:The South African Broadcasting Corp. said the song "Freedom Now" was "undesirable for broadcasting." . . . Britain's House of Commons passed a law that will force English soccer fans to carry identity cards to enter stadiums.
02/wsj_0283:The "anti-hooligan" law, which would deprive troublemakers of cards, must be ratified by the House of Lords and is expected to become effective early next year. 
02/wsj_0284:As a result, Judge John F. Keenan of New York ordered Mrs. Marcos to turn over to the court all pleadings and documents she may have filed in foreign countries in opposition to U.S. requests for evidence.
02/wsj_0284:In 1988, a year and a half after Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, Ferdinand Marcos, the ousted president of the Philippines, fled the Philippines for Hawaii, they were charged with racketeering, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and mail fraud in a scheme in which they allegedly embezzled more than $100 million from their homeland.
02/wsj_0284:Much of the money was fraudulently concealed through purchases of prime Manhattan real estate, federal prosecutors have charged.
02/wsj_0284:The law is meant to overcome delays caused by defendants' use of foreign procedures to block U.S. requests for records, Judge Keenan said in his opinion.
02/wsj_0284:On the allegation of kidnapping, Judge Keenan wrote, "The suggestion that Mrs. Marcos was brought to this country against her will is unsupported by affidavit or affirmation." 
02/wsj_0284:Though Judge Keenan threw out most of Mrs. Marcos's objections, he agreed with one of her concerns: that turning over the foreign documents could violate the defendant's constitutional right against self-incrimination.
02/wsj_0284:Sidley & Austin, a leading Chicago-based law firm, and Ashurst Morris Crisp, a midsized London firm of solicitors, are scheduled today to announce plans to open a joint office in Tokyo. 
02/wsj_0284:The firms will be registered under Japanese law as foreign legal consultants and their practice with Japanese clients will be limited to advising them on matters of foreign law.
02/wsj_0284:The office will tap the resources of Sidley's 700 lawyers in the U.S., London and Singapore as well as the 400 Ashurst staff members in London and Brussels. 
02/wsj_0284:THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS said it will seek a rehearing of a U.S. appellate court ruling against the union's claim that the state of Michigan engages in wage-discrimination against female employees.
02/wsj_0284:A three-judge panel of the court in Cincinnati made the ruling Saturday.
02/wsj_0284:NEW JERSEY MERGER: One of the largest law firms in central New Jersey has been created through the merger of Norris, McLaughlin & Marcus, a 41-lawyer firm, and Manger, Kalison, McBride & Webb, a health-care specialty law firm with 14 lawyers.
02/wsj_0284:DRUG WARS: A Texas legislator proposes color-coding drivers' licenses of some drug offenders.
02/wsj_0284:The bill would authorize courts to order the licenses as a condition of probation.
02/wsj_0284:Richard Avena, executive director of the Texas Civil Liberties Union, called the proposal "political gimmickry," and said it fails to recognize the drug problem as a health issue. 
02/wsj_0285:The amendment, offered by Rep. Douglas Bosco (D., Calif.), was approved 283-132 during debate on a bill designed to strengthen the Transportation Department's authority in dealing with leveraged buy-outs of airlines. 
02/wsj_0285:The bill would require the agency to block the acquisition of 15% or more of an airline's stock if the purchase threatened safety, reduced the carrier's ability to compete, or put the airline under foreign control.
02/wsj_0285:The amendment would require the department to block the purchase of a major airline by anyone who has run two or more carriers that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
02/wsj_0285:"This ought to be subtitled the `Don't let Frank Lorenzo take over another airline' amendment," said Rep. James Oberstar (D., Minn.), chairman of the House aviation subcommittee, who argued that the provision was unnecessary because the bill already would give the department ample power to block undesirable deals. 
02/wsj_0286:Employees wore identification badges listing not only their names but also their dates of hire.
02/wsj_0286:But in 1986, the badges and the "don't speak out of turn" rule were abolished -- early steps in a cultural revolution still rolling on with all the subtlety of a freight train.
02/wsj_0286:Nissan's decades-old corporate song filled with references to Mount Fuji has been scrapped in favor of a snappy tune sung by a popular Japanese vocalist. 
02/wsj_0286:And in a Japanese corporate first, Nissan recently opened the first coed company dormitory for single employees at the suburban Tokyo technical center. "We had lots of internal debate about this one," concedes Tadahiko Fukuyama, a senior public-relations official. "But in the end, top management decided to follow the voice of the younger generation." 
02/wsj_0286:This corporate glasnost is a big reason Nissan, after years of making lackluster cars and lousy profits, has loosened up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits, ranging from the sleek Maxima sedan and Porsche-like 300ZX to the whimsically nostalgic Pao, a minicar sold only in Japan.
02/wsj_0286:Atsushi Muramatsu, Nissan's executive vice president for finance, helped set the tone in December 1986, when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a Japanese auto maker since the nation's postwar recovery. "This is a time of self-criticism to discover what is wrong with us," he said.
02/wsj_0286:Nissan's market share in Japan had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade.
02/wsj_0286:Its U.S. sales sagged, partly because of price increases due to the rising yen.
02/wsj_0286:Worst of all, Nissan was preoccupied with management infighting, cronyism and corporate rigidity. 
02/wsj_0286:Consider the experience of Satoko Kitada, a 30-year-old designer of vehicle interiors who joined Nissan in 1982.
02/wsj_0286:At that time, tasks were assigned strictly on the basis of seniority. "The oldest designer got to work on the dashboard," she recalls. "The next level down did doors.
02/wsj_0286:If a new person got to work on part of the speedometer, that was a big deal." 
02/wsj_0286:Meanwhile, President Kume ordered everyone from top executives to rookie designers to go "town watching," to visit chic parts of Tokyo to try to gain insights into developing cars for trend-setters. 
02/wsj_0286:One group of middle-aged manufacturing men from the company's Zama plant outside Tokyo was supposed to check out a trendy restaurant in the city.
02/wsj_0286:But when they arrived at the door, all were afraid to go in, fearing that they would be out of place. 
02/wsj_0286:He liked the well-lighted lobby display of Honda's cars and trucks so much that he had Nissan's gloomy lobby exhibit refurbished.
02/wsj_0286:Despite the pain of adjusting, the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting cars.
02/wsj_0286:A year ago, the company completely revamped its near-luxury sedan, the $17,699 Maxima, which competes against a broad range of upscale sedans; it replaced its boxy, pug-nosed body with sleek, aerodynamic lines.
02/wsj_0286:Since then, Nissan also has launched new versions of the $13,249 240SX sporty coupe and 300ZX sports car.
02/wsj_0286:Nissan had 29% of the Japanese car market in 1980 before beginning a depressing eight-year slide that continued through last year.
02/wsj_0286:Strong sales so far this year are certain to turn the tide, but even the 25% market share that Nissan expects in 1989 will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade. 
02/wsj_0286:Nissan concedes that it won't recoup all its market-share losses in Japan until at least 1995, and even that timetable might prove optimistic. "Everyone else is going to catch up" with Nissan's innovative designs, says A. Rama Krishna, auto analyst at First Boston (Japan) Ltd. Nissan's pace of new-model hits will slow, he adds, just as arch-rival Toyota unleashes its own batch of new cars. 
02/wsj_0286:Likewise, in the U.S., Nissan has grabbed 5.2% of the car market so far this year, up from 4.5% a year ago.
02/wsj_0286:But even that brings Nissan only to the share it had in 1987, and leaves the company behind its high of 5.5% in 1980 and 1982. 
02/wsj_0286:Nissan hopes that that will start to change this fall, with its new version of the Stanza compact sedan.
02/wsj_0286:But "on a new car, a rebate doesn't work well" because it cheapens the vehicle's image, contends Thomas D. Mignanelli, executive vice president of Nissan's U.S. sales arm. 
02/wsj_0286:At the opposite end of the market, Nissan launches its luxury Infiniti division on Nov. 8 -- three years after Honda pioneered Japanese luxury cars and two months after Toyota's Lexus went on sale.
02/wsj_0286:The ads have generated some laughs but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other U.S. auto advertising. 
02/wsj_0286:Nissan will build only about 3,500 of the $38,000 Infiniti Q45 sedans each month, sending about 2,000 of them to the U.S. and keeping the rest for sale in Japan.
02/wsj_0286:But on reflection, Mr. Oka says, he concluded that Nissan is being prudent in following its slow-startup strategy instead of simply copying Lexus. "Infiniti is Nissan's big business move for the 21st century, and we're in no hurry to generate large profits right away," Mr. Oka says.
02/wsj_0286:Nissan had record net income of 114.63 billion yen ($868 million) in the fiscal year ended last March 31, a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two years earlier, when the company lost money on operations.
02/wsj_0286:Nissan has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in Japanese car sales. 
02/wsj_0286:But Nissan expects to earn only 120 billion yen in the current fiscal year, a modest increase of 4.7%.
02/wsj_0286:In its last fiscal year, Nissan's profit represented just 2.3% of sales, compared with 4.3% at Toyota.
02/wsj_0286:Nissan is the world's only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world's key economic arenas -- the U.S., Japan and Europe.
02/wsj_0286:That gives it an enviable strategic advantage, at least until its rivals catch up, but also plenty of managerial headaches. 
02/wsj_0286:Already, personnel officials are talking about the need for a "Phase Two" cultural-reform effort of some sort. "We are still only half way through the turnaround of this company, and there are many more things to do," President Kume says.
02/wsj_0287:Warner is part of Warner Communications Inc., which is in the process of being acquired by Time Warner Inc. Mr. Azoff resigned as head of MCA Records, a unit of MCA Inc., in September, and had been discussing a joint venture with both Warner and MCA.
02/wsj_0288:The White House is purposely not calling the meeting a summit so that there won't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements.
02/wsj_0288:Rather, senior administration officials said that the unexpected meeting was scheduled at Mr. Bush's request because of his preference for conducting diplomacy through highly personal and informal meetings with other leaders. 
02/wsj_0288:The two leaders will meet on Dec. 2 and 3, alternating the two days of meetings between a U.S. and a Soviet naval vessel in the Mediterranean Sea.
02/wsj_0288:In announcing the meeting yesterday, Mr. Bush told reporters at the White House that neither he nor Mr. Gorbachev expects any "substantial decisions or agreements." Instead, he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get "better acquainted" and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda. 
02/wsj_0288:Despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations, the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders.
02/wsj_0288:American officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the U.S. could help bolster his stature among Soviet politicians and academics, whose support he needs. 
02/wsj_0288:Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), who has been the most prominent Democratic critic of Mr. Bush's handling of the Soviet relationship, praised the president for arranging the meeting.
02/wsj_0288:But he added: "The mere fact of a meeting doesn't deal with the substance of policy." 
02/wsj_0288:Mr. Bush said that the December meeting, which was announced simultaneously in Moscow, will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the "fanfare" and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers. "By doing it in this manner we can have, I would say, more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances, things of that nature for public consumption," Mr. Bush said. 
02/wsj_0288:He recently told a small group of American businessmen in Moscow that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the U.S., possibly at the 1990 summit.
02/wsj_0288:In an unusually candid article about the latest economic woe -- unemployment -- Pravda yesterday reported that three million Soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to 16 million by the year 2005.
02/wsj_0288:Economists in Moscow are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits. 
02/wsj_0288:Western analysts say that, given the meeting's setting at sea, Gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact. 
02/wsj_0288:That theme has been a recurring one for Soviet military officials for much of this year.
02/wsj_0288:They argue that as the Kremlin follows through on announced plans to cut land forces -- the Soviets' area of greatest strength -- the U.S. should show more willingness to cut sea forces -- Washington's area of greatest superiority. 
02/wsj_0288:One of the reasons Bush administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering, former President Reagan's 1986 meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland.
02/wsj_0288:That meeting sent shivers through the Western alliance because Mr. Reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting American allies. 
02/wsj_0288:But word of the possible session was closely held by the president and a handful of top aides, and word of it didn't reach many second-level officials until the past few days.
02/wsj_0288:Though President Bush's political critics at home have been urging him to open a more direct dialogue with Mr. Gorbachev, it actually was the arguments of leaders within the Soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the December meeting.
02/wsj_0288:Mr. Bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in Europe in July with the leaders of Poland and Hungary, who urged him to support Mr. Gorbachev's efforts to transform the Soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on Eastern Europe, a senior aide said.
02/wsj_0289:Banca Nazionale del Lavoro said its potential losses from lending to Iraq could reach 1.175 trillion lire ($872 million), marking the bank's first quantification of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its Atlanta branch. 
02/wsj_0289:State-owned BNL, Italy's largest bank, has filed charges against the branch's former manager, Christopher Drogoul, and a former branch vice president, alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties. 
02/wsj_0289:BNL also said that its board had approved "after an in-depth discussion," a letter to the Bank of Italy outlining measures the state-owned bank has taken or plans to take to improve controls on its foreign branches.
02/wsj_0289:Bank of Italy has also ordered BNL to shore up its capital base to account for potential foreign loan losses, and the Rome bank has outlined a 3 trillion lire capital-raising operation. 
02/wsj_0290:Hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging limp protesters from some building or thoroughfare in one of our cities.
02/wsj_0290:Of recent note are the activities of the pro- and anti-abortionists, anti-nuclear activists, animal rights protesters, college students concerned about racism, anti-apartheid groups, various self-styled "environmentalists" and those dissatisfied with the pace of the war against AIDS. 
02/wsj_0290:The Mahatma, or "great souled one," instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India.
02/wsj_0290:Unfortunately, according to Webster's Biographical Dictionary, "His policies went beyond his control and resulted . . . in riots and disturbances" and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience "resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment." I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did, but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power, and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them. 
02/wsj_0290:Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights, there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it.
02/wsj_0290:There may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it.
02/wsj_0290:The case of Rosa Parks, the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus, comes to mind as an illustration.
02/wsj_0290:But most cases of non-violent civil disobedience are not nearly so benign. 
02/wsj_0290:Lawful demonstrations, such as peaceful picketing and other assemblages that do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere with the rights of others, are rights guaranteed by any truly free system of government.
02/wsj_0290:The subject of this discussion is non-violent civil disobedience; but, before we get on with that, let me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations.
02/wsj_0290:The delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted through bullhorns, militant gestures, accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics.
02/wsj_0290:Demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile.
02/wsj_0290:Petty criminals and street people looking for excitement attach themselves like remora to the fringes of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing, auto trashing, arson, window breaking, looting, pocket picking and general hooliganism.
02/wsj_0290:Soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost in mob mania.
02/wsj_0290:Some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass, minor property destruction, blocking traffic and the like.
02/wsj_0290:The politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups.
02/wsj_0290:In a planned protest against his appearance, several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the TV cameras in such a way that the program cannot continue.
02/wsj_0290:The demonstrators have been non-violent, but the result of their trespasses has been to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute. 
02/wsj_0290:It might be alleged that TV has done more than its share to popularize and promote non-violent civil disobedience, so the second situation hypothesized above would be simply a case of "chickens coming home to roost." Or maybe the TV network would lose nothing.
02/wsj_0290:Let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only harms other people indirectly, yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole.
02/wsj_0290:Their cowardly acts of civil disobedience, which they tried to hide under the cloak of outrage at a war they characterized as "immoral," weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served honorably in that conflict. 
02/wsj_0290:Even more at fault are those leaders in and out of government who urged and supported their defections, thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy propagandists.
02/wsj_0290:Worse, it remained to a well-meaning but naive president of the United States to administer the final infamy upon those who fought and died in Vietnam. 
02/wsj_0290:Under the guise of "healing the wounds of the nation," President Carter pardoned thousands of draft evaders, thus giving dignity to their allegations of the war's "immorality." The precedent having been set, who can complain if future generations called upon to defend the U.S. yield to the temptation to avoid the danger of combat by simply declaring the war immoral and hiding until it is over? 
02/wsj_0290:Finally, I think it important to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage.
02/wsj_0290:Give television a chance to cover live any breaking of the law, and no second invitation will be required.
02/wsj_0290:This brings into question the motives of those who lead civil disobedience demonstrations.
02/wsj_0290:Here is a good rule of thumb: If the movement produced the leader, the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement.
02/wsj_0290:In either case, ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience.
02/wsj_0290:If you have not, it is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course. 
02/wsj_0290:Mr. Agnew was vice president of the U.S. from 1969 until he resigned in 1973. 
02/wsj_0291:The tax increase, which will be considered at a special session of the state legislature that begins tomorrow, would cover only part of the estimated $4 billion to $6 billion in total damage caused by the Oct. 17 quake.
02/wsj_0291:"I am not aware that there is anything but bipartisan agreement for the general outline" of the revenue-raising plan, said a spokesman for the governor, after a Monday meeting with legislative leaders over the quake-relief question. 
02/wsj_0291:The tax increase -- on top of the current six-cent per dollar sales tax -- would become effective this Dec. 1 and expire Dec. 31, 1990.
02/wsj_0291:Some legislators expressed concern that a gas-tax increase would take too long and possibly damage chances of a major gas-tax-increasing ballot initiative that voters will consider next June. 
02/wsj_0292:Newsprint results continued to be depressed, the company added, because of industrywide price discounting. 
02/wsj_0292:The quarter-to-quarter comparison was also enhanced by charges taken in the year-earlier period, including $11 million related to the modernization of a pulp and newsprint mill in Alabama.
02/wsj_0293:This is the year: Unsuspecting filers of 1988 personal returns are being picked randomly for thorough audits to help the IRS update its criteria for enforcement, audit selection, and use of resources.
02/wsj_0293:Sen. Pryor (D., Ark.), a leader on the issue who generally backs the House plan, wants some changes -- for one, separate sanctions for negligence and large misstatements of tax owed, not a single penalty.
02/wsj_0293:TAXPAYERS' RIGHTS are defined by a growing number of states. 
02/wsj_0293:The 1988 tax act created a federal bill of rights spelling out IRS duties to protect taxpayers' rights in the assessment and collection of taxes.
02/wsj_0293:In 1989, Illinois, Kansas, Ohio, Oregon and South Carolina have adopted rights laws, the Federation of Tax Administrators, a state officials' group, reports; the features vary.
02/wsj_0293:One group is the Committee on State Taxation, which comprises 330 multistate corporations and advises the Council of State Chambers of Commerce.
02/wsj_0293:The group's Mark Cahoon says its efforts begun in 1989 have led to the introduction of bills in Massachusetts, Minnesota and Colorado to establish evenhanded procedures affecting all kinds of taxpayers.
02/wsj_0293:This week, New York City announced a 10-point policy patterned on the federal bill of rights for taxpayers. 
02/wsj_0293:THE MILEAGE RATE allowed for business use of a car in 1989 has risen to 25.5 cents a mile for the first 15,000 from 24 cents in 1988, the IRS says; the rate stays 11 cents for each added mile.
02/wsj_0293:The court often weighs deductions of sideline-business costs: Do they stem from a profit-seeking activity or a nondeductible hobby?
02/wsj_0293:Charles O. Givens of Mount Vernon, Ind.-investment broker, ex-accountant, and son of a former stable owner-bred Tennessee Walking Horses for six years, raised cattle for four, and never made a profit on either.
02/wsj_0293:The judge said Givens may deduct his $30,180 of losses from horse breeding, but rejected the $12,275 in deductions from the cattle operation. 
02/wsj_0293:BRIEFS: The IRS already is doing intensive TCMP audits of 19,000 returns for 1987 and fiscal 1988 filed by corporations with under $10 million in assets. . . . President Bush says he will name Donald E. Kirkendall to the new Treasury post of inspector general, which has responsibilities for the IRS. . . . The U.S. and Finland signed an income-tax treaty, subject to ratification. 
02/wsj_0294:Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., said it is examining the ruling to determine if it can appeal. 
02/wsj_0294:Like any other creditor, the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim. 
02/wsj_0294:That may leave a lot of leeway for U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland to decide what, if anything, the pilots actually collect.
02/wsj_0294:Eastern's creditors committee, along with the company, has consistently opposed the pilots' claim, which if paid would have to come out of money both hope to use to pay off other bankruptcy claims. 
02/wsj_0294:Eastern and its creditors are in the final, delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline's debts.
02/wsj_0294:The clause was part of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise. 
02/wsj_0294:Shortly after Texas Air took control of Eastern, some Machinists union supervisors received a 20% pay raise.
02/wsj_0294:Another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between Eastern and its pilots, resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union.
02/wsj_0294:Ironically, many of the pilots involved have left Eastern or are still striking the carrier, which filed for bankruptcy protection March 9.
02/wsj_0295:The general public may not know his name, but he's famous -- make that infamous -- in advertising circles: A marketing consultant, he pioneered slashing ad agency commissions, to the delight of advertising clients and the dismay of agencies. 
02/wsj_0295:Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide named Mr. Achenbaum, 62, vice chairman of professional services, reporting directly to Carl Spielvogel, chairman and chief executive officer.
02/wsj_0295:They have since mellowed, although one senior Young & Rubicam executive, echoing others, said: "I think ad agencies owe Carl {Spielvogel} a vote of thanks for getting him out of the consulting business." 
02/wsj_0295:But industry executives also believe hiring Mr. Achenbaum is a shrewd move for Backer Spielvogel, a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi.
02/wsj_0295:Mr. Achenbaum has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country, including Nissan, Toyota, Seagram and Backer Spielvogel clients Hyundai and J.P. Morgan.
02/wsj_0295:His client contacts, meanwhile, could prove a gold mine for an agency that has had few new business wins of late. "I've done over 40 ad agency searches {for clients}, so I have a pretty good notion of what clients are interested in when they look for an agency," Mr. Achenbaum said.
02/wsj_0295:Mr. Achenbaum, too, delves into his clients' business. "Carl has a much higher degree of intimacy with his clients than is ordinary for an agency his size.
02/wsj_0295:And with Al's record of being a delver and a detail guy, you can see how the two fit," said Alan Gottesman, an analyst with PaineWebber. 
02/wsj_0295:He spent most of his career formulating marketing strategies, but became best-known for chipping away at ad agency compensation. 
02/wsj_0295:He ultimately became so well-known for cutting compensation, however, that clients didn't seek him out for anything else. "I was very frustrated," he said. "The fact of the matter is, I am a marketer.
02/wsj_0295:Mr. Spielvogel said Mr. Achenbaum will work with clients to determine the mix of promotion, merchandising, publicity and other marketing outlets, and to integrate those services.
02/wsj_0295:"The trail of revenue is increasingly going away from pure advertising, and going towards other services," Mr. Spielvogel said.
02/wsj_0295:Instead of being just an ad agency, he said: "We have redefined our mission here.
02/wsj_0295:Our mission is to help our clients grow, and to use every tool of marketing communications to accomplish that." 
02/wsj_0295:Leonard Matthews, then-president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, called Mr. Achenbaum a "quisling" in an incendiary 1987 speech.
02/wsj_0295:J. Nicholas Hahn, Cotton Inc. 's president and chief executive, was an outspoken critic of WPP Group's acquisition of Ogilvy Group earlier this year.
02/wsj_0295:Cotton Inc. 's new $9 million campaign calls cotton the "Fabric of Our Lives." The campaign replaces its "Take Comfort in Cotton" ads and marks the end of its national cooperative advertising efforts.
02/wsj_0295:For years, the company's ads were tied in with pitches for Cannon sheets or Martex towels, for example, and an announcer at the end of the ads would tell customers where to "find the true performance label." 
02/wsj_0295:With the new TV spots, Ogilvy & Mather has opted for a family style with lots of laughter, hugs and tears. "We're making a fairly obvious plea for some emotional reaction," says Tom Rost, creative director at Ogilvy & Mather. 
02/wsj_0295:Frank L. Mingo, one of the pioneers of advertising targeted at black audiences, died at the age of 49 after a stroke. 
02/wsj_0295:Mr. Mingo was chief executive officer of the Mingo Group, which he founded in 1977 and which created ads for the black market.
02/wsj_0296:Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's leader and one of Asia's leading statesmen for 30 years, recently announced his intention to retire next year -- though not necessarily to end his influence.
02/wsj_0296:The prime minister, whose hair is thinning and gray and whose face has a perpetual pallor, nonetheless continues to display an energy, a precision of thought and a willingness to say publicly what most other Asian leaders dare say only privately. 
02/wsj_0296:The 66-year-old Mr. Lee recently spent an hour discussing the state of Asia and the world with two Journal reporters in his plainly furnished, wood-paneled office.
02/wsj_0296:Skipping personal pleasantries, Mr. Lee picked up exactly where he left off several months earlier -- before the government crackdown in China -- when he had warned that the orthodox leadership in Beijing feared a plurality of views.
02/wsj_0296:On China's turmoil: "It is a very unhappy scene," he said. "It took Zhao Ziyang (former premier and party chief) 10 years to build a team of economists who understood how the Western economies work and now that team is part in exile, part being rusticated and part missing." Rebuilding that team, Mr. Lee predicted, will take another 10 years. "That's very sad for China and for Asia because China could have been a good engine for growth, not just for Hong Kong and Taiwan but for Japan, Korea and the rest of Asia." 
02/wsj_0296:They are already industrialized. . . . Their problem is one of inefficiency of an industrial economy.
02/wsj_0296:Asked if the Soviets, like Chinese officials, won't one day face a similar conflict between the desire to liberalize economically and yet retain political control, Mr. Lee said, "I would think that the Soviets face a deeper dilemma because they have been more in blinkers than the Chinese -- I mean keeping their people cut off from the outside world." Mikhail Gorbachev, he said, is ahead of China's leaders in his awareness of the world. "But I think the Soviet peoples are more introverted than the Chinese." Regardless, he said, he still believes the Soviet Union, while falling far short of the efficiency of a Western economy, may well manage to improve considerably. 
02/wsj_0296:On Asia-Pacific prosperity: "If America can keep up the present situation -- her markets open for another 15 years, with adjustments, and Japan can grow and not cut back, and so too, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand -- then in 15 years, the economies of these countries would be totally restructured to be able to almost sustain growth by themselves." In such an arrangement, "all benefit," he said. "And if the Europeans come in, they benefit too.
02/wsj_0296:Asked about the possibility of greater economic cooperation among Asia-Pacific nations, which will be discussed Nov. 6 and 7 at a ministerial meeting in Canberra, Mr. Lee said the goal "is to have a free and open world trading system." An Asian bloc isn't intended, he said. "That's not possible." 
02/wsj_0296:I believe the U.S. is becoming more patient and circumspect," he said. "It's the total relationship that is important." The total relationship, as Mr. Lee sees it, is "the flow of dollars to the U.S. to fund the deficits, the investments the Japanese are making in the U.S. in order to satisfy American demand that American products consumed in America should be made as much as possible in America by Americans with Japanese technology and capital." 
02/wsj_0296:On U.S. military presence in Asia: Asked if his offer to allow the American military to use facilities in Singapore would help preserve America's presence in the region at bases in the Philippines, he said, "What we have done is make it easier for the Philippines to continue to host American bases without it being said they are lackeys of the imperialists and the only ones in Asia or in Southeast Asia.
02/wsj_0296:We are willing to share the political burden of being host to America, an imperial power.
02/wsj_0296:On U.S.-Philippine relations: "It's such a mixed-up relationship going back into history. . . . I really do not understand how it is that Filipinos feel so passionately involved in this father figure that they want to dispose of and yet they need.
02/wsj_0296:I mean it is a normal adult relationship. "But the Filipinos and the Americans, when I talk to them, there's so much passion about Filipino manhood being diminished as a result of being squatted upon by the Americans and so on.
02/wsj_0296:I suppose sooner or later, the Japanese would have to fill up a large part of the gap on the naval side.
02/wsj_0296:On economic consequences of a diminished U.S. presence: "America is the only major power in recent history that has used its military might to sustain a system that enables all participants to equally benefit without her as the provider of the security taking royalties." Asked why so few nations seem to share his views of America, he said, "Many people see it that way.

02/wsj_0297:Dr. Levy's answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe, a device that he and dozens of U.S. researchers are studying with great hope.
02/wsj_0297:Besides holding the promise of safer spinal surgery, the probe could improve the diagnosis of brain and nerve disorders such as strokes and multiple sclerosis.
02/wsj_0297:Perhaps most exciting, the device is thrusting open a window to the workings of the brain. 
02/wsj_0297:The probe, which is painless, non-invasive and apparently harmless, employs strong magnetic fields to induce small whirlwinds of electricity within the brain.
02/wsj_0297:"Until now, we've had no objective way of measuring motor function," says Keith Chiappa, a neurologist conducting clinical tests with the devices at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital. "All we could do was tell a patient, `squeeze my fingers as hard as you can' or `raise your arm. ' " Under the best circumstances such tests are subjective; when a patient is unconscious, they don't work at all. 
02/wsj_0297:Magnetic brain tweaking started in the early 1900s, when researchers produced flashes of light in the visual field with magnets.
02/wsj_0297:But for brain tests, the unwieldy machines "would have required patients to stand on their heads," says Reginald Bickford, a researcher at the University of California at San Diego. 
02/wsj_0297:"We don't feel we can use {the devices} routinely in surgery yet, but we're getting close," says Dr. Levy, who is now with the University of Pittsburgh.
02/wsj_0297:The devices could help indicate when surgery would help, says Charles Tator, a University of Toronto neurosurgeon.
02/wsj_0297:"The cost {of magnetic stimulators} would seem like peanuts if we could retrieve limb function" in such people, Dr. Tator says. 
02/wsj_0297:But no significant problems have been reported among hundreds of people tested with the devices. 
02/wsj_0297:And some doctors who have conducted hours of tests on themselves report temporary headaches. 
02/wsj_0297:At least two companies, Cadwell Laboratories Inc. of Kennewick, Wash., and Novametrix Medical Systems Inc. of Wallingford, Conn., now sell versions of the magnetic devices.
02/wsj_0297:At the University of Kentucky, a team led by Dean Currier, a physical therapy researcher, is testing the stimulators in conjunction with electric shocks to induce muscle contractions to help prevent wasting of thigh muscles after knee surgery.
02/wsj_0297:Probing with the stimulators, National Institutes of Health scientists recently showed how the brain reorganizes motor-control resources after an amputation.
02/wsj_0297:At the State University of New York at Brooklyn, researchers flash two groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human guinea pigs.
02/wsj_0297:When the jolt is timed just right, the subjects don't recall seeing the first group of letters. 
02/wsj_0297:"Where does that first stimulus go?" exclaims SUNY neurologist Paul Maccabee. "Trying to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories," such as precisely where and how the brain processes incoming signals from the eyes.
02/wsj_0298:The collaboration will include at least 25 researchers and will be aimed primarily at developing thin films of high-temperature superconductors for use in electronics, the companies said.
02/wsj_0298:Joint-research programs have proliferated as U.S. companies seek to spread the risks and costs of commercializing new superconductors and to meet the challenges posed by foreign consortia, especially in Japan. 
02/wsj_0298:The latest research pact bolsters Du Pont's growing portfolio of investments in superconductors.
02/wsj_0298:Last year, Du Pont agreed to pay $4.5 million for rights to superconductor work at the University of Houston. 
02/wsj_0298:The Los Alamos laboratory is one of three U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories designed as pilot centers to foster joint industry-government programs to speed the transfer of new superconductors to the marketplace. 
02/wsj_0299:J.C. PENNEY Co., Dallas, said it issued $350 million of securities backed by credit-card receivables.
02/wsj_0299:The expected average life of the certificates is 10 years, with the final scheduled payment in October, 2001.
02/wsj_0299:As part of the transaction, J.C. Penney will sell a portion of its credit-card receivables to its JCP Receivables Inc. unit, which will then transfer them to a master trust.
02/wsj_0299:Credit support will be provided by a letter of credit facility from Credit Suisse in favor of the trustee, Fuji Bank & Trust Co., for the benefit of the certificate holders.
03/wsj_0300:Battle-tested Japanese industrial managers here always buck up nervous newcomers with the tale of the first of their countrymen to visit Mexico, a boatload of samurai warriors blown ashore 375 years ago. 
03/wsj_0300:"From the beginning, it took a man with extraordinary qualities to succeed in Mexico," says Kimihide Takimura, president of Mitsui group's Kensetsu Engineering Inc. unit. 
03/wsj_0300:Still, 20 Japanese companies, including giants such as Sanyo Industries Corp., Matsushita Electronics Components Corp. and Sony Corp. have set up shop in the state of Northern Baja California.
03/wsj_0300:Keeping the Japanese happy will be one of the most important tasks facing conservative leader Ernesto Ruffo when he takes office Nov. 1, as the first opposition governor in Mexico's modern history. 
03/wsj_0300:From the Mexicans' viewpoint, vaunted tactics of methodical Japanese managers don't count for much in a land where a saying says "there are no fixed rules." 
03/wsj_0300:Japan ranks as only the fourth largest foreign investor in Mexico, with 5% of the total investments.
03/wsj_0300:That is just 1% of all the money Japan has invested abroad. 
03/wsj_0300:But maintaining the key components of his strategy -- a stable exchange rate and high level of imports -- will consume enormous amounts of foreign exchange.
03/wsj_0300:The problem is that Japanese businesses make decisions with a view well beyond the coming months that weigh so heavily on Mr. Salinas. "The Japanese will come to Mexico, but not immediately," says Kazushige Suzuki, director-general of the Japanese External Trade Organization in Mexico.
03/wsj_0300:Ryukichi Imai, Japan's ambassador to Mexico, agrees that Mexico may be too eager.  "There seems to be a presumption in some sectors of (Mexico's) government that there is a lot of Japanese money waiting behind the gate, and that by slightly opening the gate, that money will enter Mexico.  I don't think that is the case."
03/wsj_0300:Mexican officials maintain the Japanese reserve is only a result of unfamiliarity. "Because of distance, it takes a while for them to appreciate the economic stability we've achieved," says one economic policymaker.
03/wsj_0300:Mexico is sending a number of missions to Japan looking for a major breakthrough investment in telecommunications, petrochemicals or tourism.
03/wsj_0300:It also made artful use of semantics, redefining as non-strategic industries some that had been in the national domain. 
03/wsj_0300:"Those devices don't give sufficient certainty to our bosses in Japan," says Yasuo Nakamura, representative of the Industrial Bank of Japan.
03/wsj_0300:Mr. Nakamura cites the case of a customer who wants to build a giant tourism complex in Baja and has been trying for eight years to get around Mexican restrictions on foreign ownership of beachfront property.
03/wsj_0300:Some say the best hope for the Mexicans is catching the eye of Japan by promoting the one industry the Japanese clearly like -- the border assembly plants, known as "maquiladoras," which are open to 100% foreign control. 
03/wsj_0300:"We must do more to help the Japanese here in Baja if we want them to invest elsewhere," says Mr. Ruffo, the governor-elect of the National Action Party and himself a succesful businessman.
03/wsj_0301:Shaken by tumbling stock prices and pessimistic projections of U.S. economic growth, currency analysts around the world have toned down their assessments of the dollar's near-term performance. 
03/wsj_0301:Most of the 10 analysts polled last week by Dow Jones International News Service in Frankfurt, Tokyo, London and New York expect the U.S. dollar to ease only mildly in November.
03/wsj_0301:Half of those polled see the currency trending lower over the next three months, while the others forecast a modest rebound after the New Year. 
03/wsj_0301:A month ago, a similar survey predicted the dollar would be trading at 1.8690 marks and 139.75 yen by the end of October.
03/wsj_0301:In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency was trading at about 142.95 yen at midmorning, up from 142.80 yen at the opening and up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 142.15 yen. 
03/wsj_0301:The average of estimates of the 10 economists polled puts the dollar around 1.8200 marks at the end of November and at 141.33 yen. 
03/wsj_0301:A number of those polled predict the dollar will slip as the Federal Reserve eases interest rates. 
03/wsj_0301:David Owen, an economist at Kleinwort Benson & Co. in London, said he expects further cuts in short-term U.S. rates in an effort to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the U.S. economy. 
03/wsj_0301:Robert White, a vice president and manager of corporate trade at First Interstate of California, agreed with that view and predicted the U.S. federal funds rate will drop to between 7 3/4% and 8% within 60 days from its current level at 8 13/16%.
03/wsj_0301:He expects such a cut "because of problems in several sectors of the economy, particularly real estate and automobiles." 
03/wsj_0301:In last month's survey, a number of currency analysts predicted the dollar would be pressured by a narrowing of interest rate differentials between the U.S. and West Germany. 
03/wsj_0301:But predictions that central banks of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial nations would continue their massive dollar sales went astray, as the market drove the dollar downward on its own, reacting to Wall Street's plunge and subsequent price volatility, lower U.S. interest rates and signs of a slowing U.S. economy.
03/wsj_0301:G-7 consists of the U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany, Canada, France and Italy. 
03/wsj_0301:Tomoshige Kakita, senior deputy manager in the treasury department of Mitsui Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, suggested that uncertainty about U.S. stocks and bonds has made Japanese investors leery of holding those securities in the near term, thus damping dollar demand. 
03/wsj_0301:Alfred Zapfel, chief trader at Bank of Boston in Frankfurt, took an opposite stance.
03/wsj_0301:He said he expects U.S. interest rates to decline, dragging the dollar down to around 1.80 marks by the end of January after a short-lived dash to 1.87 marks by the end of November.
03/wsj_0301:"But I'm not one of these great dollar bears you see more of these days," Mr. Zapfel said. "I can't really see it dropping far below 1.80 marks." 
03/wsj_0301:Scott Greene, chief foreign exchange dealer with Julius Baer & Co. in New York, fits the description of a "great dollar bear." He predicted the U.S. unit will skid below 1.80 marks to around 1.78 marks this month and 1.75 marks by the beginning of the new year. 
03/wsj_0301:"We're finally seeing the culmination of all the recessionary buildup of the last few months," he said, noting a continuing downward trend in U.S. interest rates, a shaky stock market and "gloomier economic times ahead" all signal a significantly lower dollar. 
03/wsj_0301:In the wake of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's surprise resignation and sterling's subsequent nose-dive, most analysts had little good to say about the pound's near-term prospects. 
03/wsj_0301:Mr. Owen of Kleinwort Benson suggested that the new chancellor, John Major, will take a tough line in his autumn statement later this month, helping to underpin the pound.
03/wsj_0302:West Germany will repeal the unpopular turnover tax on securities transactions as of Jan. 1, 1991, Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said. 
03/wsj_0302:He said the government will also repeal the 1% transaction tax on the first-time purchase of stakes in companies. 
03/wsj_0302:The announcement follows several comments by government officials that the government will speed up the repeal of the tax, which was originally scheduled to fall with the start of the single internal market in the European Community at the end of 1992. 
03/wsj_0302:The securities-turnover tax has been long criticized by the West German financial community because it tends to drive securities trading and other banking activities out of Frankfurt into rival financial centers, especially London, where trading transactions isn't taxed. 
03/wsj_0302:In the interview, Mr. Haussmann didn't specify the amount of revenue the government will lose after the tax disappears. 
03/wsj_0302:The new date means that the tax will be officially repealed before the end of the current parliamentary term at the end of 1990 and guarantees its abolition even if the current center-right coalition loses the elections in December 1990. 
03/wsj_0303:Earlier this year, President Bush made a final "take-it-or-leave it" offer on the minimum wage: an increase to $4.25 an hour over three years, and only if accompanied by a lower wage for the first six months of a job.
03/wsj_0303:The only permanent losers will be the 200,000 or so workers everyone agrees will be priced out of a job at the $4.25 rate Congress is likely to approve today.
03/wsj_0304:The head trader of Chemical Banking Corp. 's interest-rate options group has left the company, following valuation errors that resulted in a $33 million charge against its third-quarter results. 
03/wsj_0304:A separate inquiry by Chemical cleared Mr. Edelson of allegations that he had been lavishly entertained by a New York money broker.
03/wsj_0304:-- Lee Wakeman, vice president in charge of options research who discovered the valuation errors and was asked by senior management to straighten out the mess, resigned to take a position in asset and liability management at Continental Bank in Chicago.
03/wsj_0304:While the incidents involving interest-rate options and forward-rate agreements are unrelated, some observers say they echo a 1987 incident in which Bankers Trust New York Corp. restated the value of its foreign exchange options contracts downward by about $80 million. 
03/wsj_0304:These complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued separately in light of current market conditions.
03/wsj_0304:From 1987 to 1988, the value of Chemical's option contracts outstanding mushroomed to $37 billion from $17 billion.
03/wsj_0304:More importantly, the volume of options written exceeded those purchased by almost 2-to-1.
03/wsj_0304:With such a lopsided book of options, traders say, Chemical was more vulnerable to erroneous valuation assumptions. 
03/wsj_0304:Its valuation methodologies, she said, "are recognized as some of the best on the Street.
03/wsj_0305:When Thomas W. Wathen went big league last year, he acquired a treasure-trove of Americana along with a well-known but ailing security business: Pinkerton's Inc. 
03/wsj_0305:There was a wanted poster offering "Rewards for the Arrest of Express and Train Robbers Frank James and Jesse W. James" and the original Pinkerton's logo with an open eye and the inscription "We Never Sleep," which inspired the phrase "private eye." Then there were two gold watches once owned by Allan Pinkerton, who founded the company in Chicago in 1850.
03/wsj_0305:The missing watch is emblematic of the problems Mr. Wathen encountered in building his closely held California Plant Protection Security Service into the largest detective and security agency in the U.S. through acquisitions.
03/wsj_0305:The ever-optimistic Mr. Wathen has learned that while acquiring a big brand-name company can be a shortcut to growth, it can also bring a host of unforeseen problems. 
03/wsj_0305:"We cleared out a lot of rats' nests," says the 60-year-old security veteran. 
03/wsj_0305:Yet although California Plant Protection was netting bigger and bigger clients -- the firm provided security for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles -- it still didn't have the name recognition of Pinkerton's.
03/wsj_0305:So when American Brands Inc. decided to sell the unit in 1987 as part of a divestiture of its food and security industries operations, Mr. Wathen saw a chance to accomplish several objectives. 
03/wsj_0305:He decided he could easily merge Pinkerton's operations with his own while slashing overhead costs because the two already operated in many of the same cities.
03/wsj_0305:He could acquire a staff of loyal Pinkerton's employees, many of whom had spent their entire careers with the firm, he could eliminate a competitor and he could get the name recognition he'd wanted. 
03/wsj_0305:I love this business," he says. "Most of the LBO guys don't know how to run a business anyway." 
03/wsj_0305:But there were hitches, not the least of which was that, Mr. Wathen says, he proceeded almost blindly in doing the $95 million acquisition, which was completed in January 1988. "We weren't allowed to do any due diligence because of competitive reasons.
03/wsj_0305:Five years of rapid expansion under American Brands, with an emphasis on marketing the agency's services instead of improving them, had hurt Pinkerton's profits, Mr. Wathen claims.
03/wsj_0305:Pinkerton's had locked itself into low-price contracts to win new business, with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired, he adds.
03/wsj_0305:One office had 19 people doing the work of three, "and half of the employees had company automobiles." 
03/wsj_0305:The acquisition combined the country's second-largest security company, Pinkerton's, with 1987 sales of $410 million, and the fourth largest, California Plant Protection, with $250 million in sales, creating the industry's biggest firm, which took on the Pinkerton's name.
03/wsj_0305:Even after divesting itself of $120 million of unprofitable business, the new Pinkerton's will have sales of about $610 million this year and operating profit roughly double the industry average of 2%-3% of sales, says Lloyd Greif of Sutro & Co. in Los Angeles, which arranged the Pinkerton's acquisition. 
03/wsj_0305:He began by closing 120 of the combined companies' 260 offices in two months, eliminating about 31% of the company's 2,500-person adminstrative staff, including more than 100 sales positions.
03/wsj_0305:Next, Mr. Wathen raised Pinkerton's rates, which were 75-cents-an-hour lower than California Plant Protection's average rate of around $8.63.
03/wsj_0305:And he got rid of low-margin businesses that just weren't making money for the company. 
03/wsj_0305:Mr. Wathen, who says Pinkerton's had a loss of nearly $8 million in 1987 under American Brands, boasts that he's made Pinkerton's profitable again.
03/wsj_0305:But Mr. Wathen's team still must pay down about $82 million of long-term bank debt from the acquisition within the next four years.
03/wsj_0305:Last year, earnings of the combined companies didn't cover debt service and Pinkerton's was forced to borrow $20 million of subordinated debt. "We wouldn't have had to refinance if a lot of the problems hadn't been there," Mr. Wathen says.
03/wsj_0305:The suit alleges that American Brands misrepresented the financial condition of Pinkerton's before the sale, failed to disclose pending lawsuits and material contracts in which Pinkerton's was in default, hadn't registered the Pinkerton's name and trademark in the United Kingdom and didn't tell California Plant Protection about some labor controversies. 
03/wsj_0305:"We have previously had discussions with representatives of Pinkerton's Inc. concerning the {sale of the company} and we concluded that we did not have liability under the contract," says American Brands. "As this is now a litigation matter, we have no further comment." 
03/wsj_0305:And then there's the case of the missing gold watch. 
03/wsj_0305:The lawsuit alleges that an inventory of Pinkerton's memorabilia disclosed that one of the watches hadn't been forked over by American Brands. "American Brand's failure to surrender the gold watch has damaged new Pinkerton's in an amount as yet {to be} determined and deprived it of a valuable artifact for which it had bargained," the suit charges. 
03/wsj_0305:Although investigations now account for only about 5% of Pinkerton's total revenue, that side of the business has traditionally been the more "glamorous" of the two and it carries historical and sentimental value. (Author Dashiell Hammett, who wrote "The Maltese Falcon," was a former Pinkerton's detective.) 
03/wsj_0307:Paramount Communications Inc., New York, completed the sale of its Associates Corp. consumer and commercial finance subsidiary to a unit of Ford Motor Co. for $3.35 billion. 
03/wsj_0307:Paramount, which agreed to sell the unit in July, said it would realize net proceeds from the sale of $2.6 billion, with an after-tax gain of $1.2 billion.
03/wsj_0307:Paramount said Associates has about $14 billion in total assets, making it third-largest in terms of assets among independent finance companies in the U.S. 
03/wsj_0308:Sea Containers Ltd., in a long-awaited move to repel a hostile takeover bid, said it will sell $1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50% of its common shares for $70 apiece. 
03/wsj_0308:Of the proceeds, $500 million will be used to fund its tender offer.
03/wsj_0308:News of the restructuring plan sent Sea Containers' shares up $1 to $62 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
03/wsj_0308:Walter Kirchberger, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said that offering holders a higher, $70-a-share price is "a fairly effective method of blocking" the Stena-Tiphook bid.
03/wsj_0308:Michael Carstens, an analyst with Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day, added that the sale of assets would allow Sea Containers to focus on its core container businesses. 
03/wsj_0308:For holders who decide not to tender their shares, Sea Containers will issue one share of preferred stock with a stated value of $25, plus a cash dividend on the common stock.
03/wsj_0308:The company said its directors, management and subsidiaries will remain long-term investors and won't tender any of their shares under the offer. 
03/wsj_0309:It appears that the only thing Congress is learning from the HUD story is how to enlarge its control of the honey pot going to special interests. 
03/wsj_0309:But it does that at the cost of deepening the taxpayer's exposure if the FHA is forced to pay for more loans going sour.
03/wsj_0309:We hear that HUD Secretary Jack Kemp is toying with going along with some of the Cranston-Mitchell proposals.
03/wsj_0309:A group of 27 Senators has written Mr. Kemp urging him to reject Cranston-Mitchell and focus on programs that empower the poor rather than create vast new government obligations.
03/wsj_0309:And the majority of Members cynically view the current discrediting of HUD as mainly a chance to shove through their own slate of projects. 
03/wsj_0309:Exhibit A is last week's House vote to fund 40 pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that is at the heart of the HUD scandal.
03/wsj_0309:None of the grants had been requested by HUD, judged competitively or were the subject of a single hearing. 
03/wsj_0309:This week, a Baltimore Sun editorial said the Lantos subcommittee on HUD should forget about Sam Pierce's testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses: the various congressional sponsors of the 40 pork-barrel projects.
03/wsj_0309:The Sun concluded that Mr. Pierce is only part of the problem -- and a part that's gone. "If HUD is to be reformed," it concluded, Members of Congress will "have to start looking into, and doing something about, the practices of their colleagues." 
03/wsj_0309:Of course, self-reform is about the last thing this Congress is interested in.
03/wsj_0309:Proponents of expanding FHA programs say they merely want to help home buyers who are frozen out of high-priced markets.
03/wsj_0309:Jack Kemp has submitted a package of reforms, and they are surely headed for the Capitol Hill sausage-grinder.
03/wsj_0310:Under the plan, Gillette South Africa will sell manufacturing facilities in Springs, South Africa, and its business in toiletries and plastic bags to Twins Pharmaceuticals Ltd., an affiliate of Anglo American Corp., a South African company. 
03/wsj_0310:The company said it is part of a continuing world-wide restructuring in which it has downsized or sold operations in several countries.
03/wsj_0310:Gillette said its continued presence in South Africa "enables it to make meaningful contributions to South African society, to the lives of its employees and to the communities in which it operates." Gillette South Africa employs about 250 people.
03/wsj_0310:About 60% of the work force will continue with Gillette or transfer to Twins Pharmaceuticals, the company said. 
03/wsj_0311:A proposal to raise prices of beer, tobacco and luxuries was rejected 338-44. 
03/wsj_0311:The Tass news agency said the 1990 budget anticipates income of 429.9 billion rubles (US$693.4 billion) and expenditures of 489.9 billion rubles (US$790.2 billion). 
03/wsj_0311:Tass said the final budget and economic plan calls for a sharp increase in the production of consumer goods. 
03/wsj_0313:Ocean Drilling & Exploration Co. will sell its contract-drilling business, and took a $50.9 million loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter because of the planned sale. 
03/wsj_0313:In the third quarter, the company, which is 61%-owned by Murphy Oil Corp. of Arkansas, had a net loss of $46.9 million, or 91 cents a share, compared with a restated loss of $9 million, or 18 cents a share, a year ago.
03/wsj_0313:The latest period had profit from continuing operations of $4 million.
03/wsj_0313:Ocean Drilling said it will offer 15% to 20% of the contract-drilling business through an initial public offering in the near future.
03/wsj_0313:Ocean Drilling said it won't hold any shares of the new company after the restructuring. 
03/wsj_0314:After 20 years of pushing labor proposals to overhaul the nation's health-care system, Bert Seidman of the AFL-CIO is finding interest from an unlikely quarter: big business. 
03/wsj_0314:Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could "lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and positions with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance," Arthur Puccini, a General Electric Co. vice president, warned earlier this year. 
03/wsj_0314:The pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus.
03/wsj_0314:Both the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Manufacturers are calling for measures to control rising costs, improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans who currently lack health insurance. 
03/wsj_0314:Agreement on these points is a long way from a specific program, and nobody expects the U.S. to rush toward radical restructuring of the health-care system.
03/wsj_0314:But there are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine. "I can't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is," says Mr. Seidman, who heads the AFL-CIO's department dealing with health matters. 
03/wsj_0314:Because the Bush administration isn't taking the initiative on health issues, business executives are dealing with congressional Democrats who champion health-care revision. "Business across the country is spending more time addressing this issue," says Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.). "It's a bottom-line issue." Business complained earlier this year when Sen. Kennedy introduced a bill that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but doesn't contain cost-control measures.
03/wsj_0314:Partly in response, a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan to attract broader support.
03/wsj_0314:At 11.1% of gross national product, U.S. health costs already are the highest in the world.
03/wsj_0314:By contrast, Japan's equal 6.7% of GNP, a nation's total output of goods and services.
03/wsj_0314:Chrysler Corp. estimates that health costs add $700 to the price of each of its cars, about $300 to $500 more per car than foreign competitors pay for health. "The cost of health care is eroding standards of living and sapping industrial strength," complains Walter Maher, a Chrysler health-and-benefits specialist. 
03/wsj_0314:In their new contract this year, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the Communications Workers of America agreed to look for "prompt and lasting national solutions" to rising health-care costs. 
03/wsj_0314:Carl Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, scoffs at "capitalists who want to socialize the entire financing system" for health. "They hope they can buy some government cost discipline," but this is a false hope, Mr. Schramm says.
03/wsj_0314:He asserts that government has done an even worse job of controlling its health bill than business. 
03/wsj_0314:Congress still is struggling to dismantle the unpopular Catastrophic Care Act of 1988, which boosted benefits for the elderly and taxed them to pay for the new coverage. 
03/wsj_0314:A quadrennial commission appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan is taking a broad look at the economics of Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor and the health system in general.
03/wsj_0314:Any major attempt to revamp the health-care system is likely to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest groups, particularly the American Medical Association, and perhaps from the public as well, if Congress takes steps that patients fear will limit the availability of care. 
03/wsj_0314:The NAM embraces efforts, which both the administration and the medical profession have begun, to measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and then to draft medical-practice guidelines.
03/wsj_0314:HHS Secretary Sullivan estimates that as much as 25% of the medical procedures performed each year may be inappropriate or unnecessary. 
03/wsj_0314:Limiting care won't be easy or popular. "To slow the rise in total spending, it will be necessary to reduce per-capita use of services," the NAM warns in a policy statement.
03/wsj_0314:This involves trade-offs and {it} cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what is `necessary. '" 
03/wsj_0315:A company spokesman declined to estimate the impact of the closures on earnings.
03/wsj_0315:He said the new facility will employ 500 of the existing 600 employees.
03/wsj_0316:Terms call for First Security to issue about 0.55 share of its stock for each Deseret share held, or a total of about 550,000 First Security shares.
03/wsj_0316:Deseret, with about $100 million in assets, is the parent of the Deseret Bank, which has six offices and headquarters at Pleasant Grove, Utah.
03/wsj_0317:T. Marshall Hahn Jr., Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview that all terms of the offer are negotiable.
03/wsj_0317:Yesterday, Nekoosa common closed in composite New York Stock Exchange trading at $62.875, up $20.125, on volume of almost 6.3 million shares.
03/wsj_0317:Takeover stock traders noted that with the junk-bond market in disarray, Georgia-Pacific's bid is an indication of where the takeover game is headed: namely, industrial companies can continue bidding for one another, but financial buyers such as leveraged buy-out firms will be at a disadvantage in obtaining financing. 
03/wsj_0317:For the paper industry specifically, most analysts said the deal will spur a wave of paper-company takeovers, possibly involving such companies as Union Camp Corp., Federal Paperboard Co. and Mead Corp.
03/wsj_0317:It was just the culture of the industry that kept it from happening.
03/wsj_0317:The Georgia-Pacific offer has definitely changed the landscape," said Gary Palmero of Oppenheimer & Co. Added Mark Rogers of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.: "It's much easier to be second." 
03/wsj_0317:A Georgia-Pacific acquisition of Nekoosa would create the largest U.S. forest-products company.
03/wsj_0317:Nekoosa ranked 11th with sales of $3.59 billion.
03/wsj_0317:The combined company would have had 1988 sales of $13.1 billion. 
03/wsj_0317:Moreover, any unexpected strengthening of the dollar would hurt Georgia-Pacific because two of Nekoosa's major product lines -- containerboard, which is used to make shipping boxes, and market pulp -- are exported in large quantities. 
03/wsj_0317:"Nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be," said Rod Young, vice president of Resource Information Systems Inc., a Bedford, Mass., economic-forecasting firm. "Depending on how far down you go, it may be difficult to pay off that debt." 
03/wsj_0317:One person familiar with Georgia-Pacific said the acquisition would more than double the company's debt of almost $3 billion.
03/wsj_0317:It also could be a drag on Georgia-Pacific earnings because the roughly $1.5 billion in goodwill -- the amount by which the bid exceeds Nekoosa's book value of $1.5 billion -- will have to be subtracted from earnings over a period of decades. 
03/wsj_0317:But he said that even under those conditions, the company still would realize a savings of tens of millions of dollars in the first year following a merger. "The fit is so good, we see this as a time of opportunity," he said. 
03/wsj_0317:For Nekoosa, defense options may be undercut somewhat by the precarious state of the junk-bond market, which limits how much value the target could reach in a debt-financed recapitalization.
03/wsj_0317:The company's chairman, Mr. Laidig, and a group of advisers met at the offices of Wachtel Lipton Rosen & Katz, a law firm specializing in takeover defense.
03/wsj_0317:Georgia-Pacific's advisers are Wasserstein, Perella & Co., which stands to receive a $15 million fee if the takeover succeeds, and the law firm of Shearman & Sterling. 
03/wsj_0317:In addition to the usual array of defenses, including a so-called poison pill and a staggered board, Nekoosa has another takeover defense: a Maine state law barring hostile bidders from merging acquired businesses for five years.
03/wsj_0317:Nekoosa's poison pill allows shareholders to vote to rescind it, but Georgia-Pacific isn't likely to pursue such a course immediately because that would take 90 to 120 days, and wouldn't affect the provisions of the Maine law. 
03/wsj_0317:Investors were quick to spot other potential takeover candidates, all of which have strong cash flows and low-cost operations.
03/wsj_0317:Among paper company stocks that rallied on the Big Board because of the offer were Union Camp, up $2.75 to $37.75, Federal Paperboard, up $1.75 to $27.875, Mead, up $2.375 to $38.75, and Temple Inland Inc., up $3.75 to $62.25.
03/wsj_0317:Some analysts argued that there won't be a flurry of takeovers because the industry's continuing capacity-expansion program is eating up available cash.
03/wsj_0317:Moreover, some analysts said they expect a foreign paper company with deeper pockets than Georgia-Pacific to end up acquiring Nekoosa, signaling to the rest of the industry that hostile bids are unproductive. 
03/wsj_0317:"This is a one-time event," said Lawrence Ross of PaineWebber Inc., referring to the Georgia-Pacific bid. 
03/wsj_0317:But many analysts believe that, given the attractiveness of paper companies' cash flows, as well as the frantic consolidation of the paper industry in Europe, there will be at least a few more big hostile bids for U.S. companies within the next several months.
03/wsj_0317:"The Georgia-Pacific bid may open the door to a new era of consolidation" in the paper industry, said Mark Devario of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
03/wsj_0317:"I don't think anyone is now immune from takeover," said Robert Schneider of Duff & Phelps Inc., Chicago.
03/wsj_0317:Indeed, a number of analysts said that Japanese paper companies are hungry to acquire additional manufacturing capacity anywhere in the world.
03/wsj_0317:Since the most-recent wave of friendly takeovers was completed in the U.S. in 1986, there have been more than 100 mergers and acquisitions within the European paper industry, he said. 
03/wsj_0318:Lyphomed Inc., Rosemont, Ill., and Medco Research Inc., Los Angeles, said the Food and Drug Administration granted full marketing approval for a new drug for the treatment of a condition in which the heart beats between 150 and 200 beats a minute. 
03/wsj_0319:The increase in wage and benefit costs in the third quarter was greater than the 1% rise reported for the third quarter of 1988. 
03/wsj_0319:The new data underscored the severity of the nation's health-care cost problem.
03/wsj_0319:In the 12 months ended in September, wages and salaries of private-sector workers rose 4.4%, while health insurance costs spurted by 13.7%.
03/wsj_0319:Despite the big increases in health-care costs, wages still account for a far greater share of overall labor costs.
03/wsj_0319:For instance, wages of private-sector hospital workers leaped 6.6% in the 12 months ended in September, compared with 4.4% for workers in all industries. 
03/wsj_0319:In the third quarter, wages and salaries in all private industry rose 1.2%, compared with 1% increases in both the second quarter and in the third quarter of 1988. 
03/wsj_0319:For private-sector union workers, the cost of wages and benefits rose 0.9% in the third quarter.
03/wsj_0319:Including employees of state and local -- but not the federal -- governments, the employment cost index rose 1.6% in the third quarter, compared with a 1.3% rise in the same quarter in 1988.
03/wsj_0319:Unlike most economic indicators, none of these figures are adjusted for seasonal variations. 
03/wsj_0320:DeSoto Inc. said it is dismissing 200 employees as part of a restructuring aimed at producing pretax savings of $10 million annually. 
03/wsj_0321:StatesWest Airlines, Phoenix, Ariz., said it withdrew its offer to acquire Mesa Airlines because the Farmington, N.M., carrier didn't respond to its offer by the close of business yesterday, a deadline StatesWest had set for a response. 
03/wsj_0321:However, StatesWest isn't abandoning its pursuit of the much-larger Mesa.
03/wsj_0321:StatesWest had proposed acquiring Mesa for $7 a share and one share of a new series of StatesWest 6% convertible preferred stock it values at $3 a share.
03/wsj_0322:Analysts said the offer for Great Northern Nekoosa broke the pall that settled over the takeover business for the past three weeks in the wake of the collapsed UAL Corp. buy-out.
03/wsj_0322:Prices of other paper makers rose sharply, although Georgia-Pacific fell $2.50 a share, to $50.875. 
03/wsj_0322:Some traders point out that as the big brokerage firms back out of program trading for their own accounts or for clients, opportunities increase for others to engage in the controversial practice.
03/wsj_0322:The rally notwithstanding, there are plenty of worries about the short-term course of stock prices.
03/wsj_0322:A slowing economy and its effect on corporate earnings is the foremost concern of many traders and analysts.
03/wsj_0322:Yesterday's major economic news -- a 0.2% rise in the September index of leading economic indicators -- had little impact on financial markets.
03/wsj_0322:But the next important piece of news on the economy's health -- this morning's release of the national purchasing manager's survey for October -- could prompt investors into action. 
03/wsj_0322:A report late yesterday that the Chicago-area purchasing managers survey showed increased economic activity in that part of the country cut into bond-price gains.
03/wsj_0322:Meanwhile, bond investors are laboring under the onus of a national debt ceiling debate.
03/wsj_0322:Although the Treasury is expected to announce details of its November quarterly refunding operation today, the Nov. 79 schedule could be delayed unless Congress and the president act soon to lift the nation's debt ceiling. 
03/wsj_0322:Advancing issues on the Big Board surged ahead of decliners 1,111 to 
03/wsj_0322:The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained less than a quarter of a point, or less than $2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount.
03/wsj_0323:But Bouygues said its first-half profit isn't indicative of the full-year trend because of the highly seasonal nature of many of the company's activities. 
03/wsj_0323:For all of 1988, Bouygues had consolidated profit of 519 million francs, after payments to minority interests, on revenue of 50 billion francs.
03/wsj_0323:The group has forecast 1989 revenue of 56.9 billion francs. 
03/wsj_0324:QVC Network Inc. said it completed its acquisition of CVN Cos. for about $423 million. 
03/wsj_0324:QVC agreed to pay $19 and one-eighth QVC share for each of CVN's 20 million fully diluted shares. 
03/wsj_0324:Among them, Home Shopping, QVC and CVN already control most of that young and fast-growing market, which last year had sales of about $1.4 billion. 
03/wsj_0325:The Los Angeles thrift holding company said it had a loss of $92.2 million, or $6.98 a share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30.
03/wsj_0325:The company said its junk-bond portfolio after these moves had been reduced to less than 1% of assets. 
03/wsj_0326:The campaign, a patriotic celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, doesn't mention cigarettes or smoking; cigarette ads have been prohibited on television since 1971.
03/wsj_0326:But even before it begins, the campaign is drawing fire from anti-smoking advocates, who criticize Philip Morris's attempt to bolster its beleaguered image by wrapping itself in the document that is a cornerstone of American democracy. 
03/wsj_0326:Philip Morris, which became the U.S.'s largest food company last year with its $12.9 billion acquisition of Kraft Inc., seems determined to evolve beyond its roots in Marlboro country.
03/wsj_0326:The company's research suggests that its name recognition among most consumers remains unusually low, although its array of brands -- including Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O, Cheez Whiz, and Miller beer -- blanket supermarket shelves. 
03/wsj_0326:Philip Morris hopes that by taking its Bill of Rights theme to the airwaves, in addition to publications, it will reach the broadest possible audience.
03/wsj_0326:Until now, its corporate ads, mainly promoting its sponsorship of the arts, have appeared almost exclusively in newspapers and magazines. 
03/wsj_0326:"Most people -- whether in Toledo, Tucson or Topeka -- haven't got a clue who we are," says Guy L. Smith, Philip Morris's vice president of corporate affairs. "If they think well of the company through our support of the Bill of Rights, it follows they'll think well of our products." Mr. Smith says the Bill of Rights commercial, which trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression, isn't designed to have any special appeal for smokers.
03/wsj_0326:Although Philip Morris typically tries to defend the rights of smokers with free-choice arguments, "this has nothing to do with cigarettes, nor will it ever," the spokesman says. 
03/wsj_0326:But some anti-smoking activists disagree, expressing anger at what they see as the company's attempt to purchase innocence by association. "I'm outraged because this company is portraying itself at the heart of American culture and political freedom and in fact it's a killer," says Michael Pertschuk, former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and a tobacco-industry critic. "It should be treated like the Medellin {drug} mafia, not the Founding Fathers." 
03/wsj_0326:Mr. Pertschuk adds that the new commercial dovetails perfectly with major aspects of Philip Morris's political strategy.
03/wsj_0326:These include trying to protect its print advertising by invoking the First Amendment, and wooing blacks by portraying itself as a protector of civil rights. (The commercial features, among others, the voice of Martin Luther King Jr., the slain civil rights leader.) 
03/wsj_0326:Many marketers say Philip Morris's approach will be effective, but they agree that the ads' implied smoking message is unmistakable. "This is clever, subliminal advertising that really says, `Smokers have rights, too, '" says Al Ries, chairman of Trout & Ries Inc., a Greenwich, Conn., marketing strategy firm. "This is designed to get the wagons in a circle and defend the smoking franchise." 
03/wsj_0326:Despite the criticism, Philip Morris's corporate campaign runs little risk of getting yanked off the tube. "They aren't showing James Madison taking a puff or lighting up," says Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University. "All they are trying to do is borrow some of the legitimacy of the Bill of Rights itself." 
03/wsj_0327:The Financial Index of 100 biggest banks and insurance issues added 2.19 to 447.76.
03/wsj_0327:Other strong sectors were indicated in gains of the Transportation Index, up 7.55 to 475.35, and the Utility Index, up 8.68 to 730.37. 
03/wsj_0327:Many of Nasdaq's biggest technology stocks were in the forefront of the rally.
03/wsj_0327:Technology stocks bore the brunt of the OTC market's recent sell-off, and traders say it's natural that they rebound sharply now that the market has turned around.
03/wsj_0327:"They are always the first to be sold when people are taking profits, because people are most scared of the high-technology stocks," said Robin West, director of research for Ladenburg Thalmann's Lanyi division, which specializes in emerging growth stocks. 
03/wsj_0327:The technology group includes many of the OTC market's biggest stocks, which dominate the market-weighted Nasdaq Composite Index.
03/wsj_0327:The technology sector of the Dow Jones Equity Market Index has risen only about 6.24% this year, while the Nasdaq Composite Index has gained 18.35%.
03/wsj_0327:While the composite index lost less than a third of its year-to-date gains in the market's recent decline, the technology group's gains were more than halved. 
03/wsj_0327:The volatility of smaller technology companies has served the group well overall in recent stock trading, according to Hambrecht & Quist's technology stock indexes. 
03/wsj_0327:The brokerage firm tracks technology stocks with its Technology Index, which appreciated only 10.59% in the first nine months of this year.
03/wsj_0327:But the firm also tracks smaller technology companies as a subset of the larger group.
03/wsj_0327:That index, which contains technology companies with annual revenues of $200 million or less, gained 17.97% by Sept. 30 this year -- still lagging the S&P 500, but leading larger technology firms. 
03/wsj_0327:"The interest-rate sensitives aren't rallying with the rest of the market because of fears about what the (Federal Reserve) will do," Mr. Jennison said.
03/wsj_0327:He said that investors will scour the October employment report, due out Friday, for clues about the direction of the economy and the immediate outlook for interest rates. 
03/wsj_0327:Shearson, with its in-house order execution system, has handled the bulk of such program trades in the over-the-counter market.
03/wsj_0327:The trading has been blamed for much of the market's recent volatility.
03/wsj_0327:Britain said it would waive its "golden share" in the luxury auto maker if shareholders vote to allow a suitor to acquire more than 15% of the company.
03/wsj_0327:The announcement effectively removes the British government as an impediment to a takeover of the company, which is being stalked by General Motors and Ford. 
03/wsj_0327:It surged 2 3/4 to 6 on volume of more than 1.7 million shares after the company agreed to be acquired by Japan's Chugai Pharmaceutical for about $110 million -- almost double the market price of Gen-Probe's stock. 
03/wsj_0327:Priam Corp. lost 5/32 to 3/32 after filing for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 
03/wsj_0327:Florida National Banks of Fla. slid 1 1/8 to 24 3/4.
03/wsj_0327:Late Monday, the Federal Reserve Board said it is delaying approval of First Union Corp. 's proposed $849 million acquisition of Florida National Banks pending the outcome of an examination into First Union's lending practices in low-income heighborhoods.
03/wsj_0327:The value of the transaction wasn't disclosed.
03/wsj_0327:The stock was one of many in the paper products industry that rose following Georgia-Pacific's $3.18 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa. 
03/wsj_0328:Faced with inevitable defeat, the once dominant industry declined any recorded vote on the ban, which covers all but a fraction of 1% of daily flights in the U.S. 
03/wsj_0328:The sole exceptions are an estimated 30 flights of six hours or more beginning or ending in Hawaii and Alaska.
03/wsj_0328:The additional spending pushes the measure more than $2 billion above its prescribed budget ceiling, and the House Appropriations Committee leadership must now seek a waiver in hopes of completing action today. 
03/wsj_0328:The separate $67 billion bill sent to the White House had budget difficulties, too, but was saved ultimately by its importance to a broad spectrum of interests in Congress and the administration itself.
03/wsj_0328:And in anticipation of increased lending, the cap on FHA loan guarantees would rise to approximately $73.8 billion. 
03/wsj_0328:Separately, the bill gives authority to the Department of Housing and Urban Development to facilitate the refinancing of high-interest loans subsidized by the government under the so-called Section 235 home-ownership program for lower-income families.
03/wsj_0328:But the promise of at least $15 million in new savings helped to forge a partnership between HUD Secretary Jack Kemp and lawmakers wanting to protect their projects elsewhere. 
03/wsj_0328:A string of costly projects, including the high-speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite, would continue to be developed within these limits.
03/wsj_0328:And while imposing a statutory cap of $1.6 billion on future spending, the bill would give NASA $30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission, a successor to the Voyager space probe. 
03/wsj_0328:The result is that all sides resort to sleight of hand to make room for competing housing and environmental programs, and the commitments now will drive excess spending into fiscal 1991. 
03/wsj_0328:Senior members of the House Budget Committee are reduced in frustration to raising doomed parliamentary obstacles to individual bills, yet admit that much of the disorder now stems from the fiscal legerdemain associated with their own summit agreement with the White House this past spring. "It's hard to get the administration's attention on anything," said Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn.), "because the whole agreement was built on gimmickry." 
03/wsj_0328:Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, used his influence to preserve more than $132,000 in subsidies for air service to Sante Fe, N.M., and more than $2.1 million would go for service to eight communities in the western Nebraska district of GOP Rep. Virginia Smith on the House Appropriations Committee. 
03/wsj_0328:GP Express, an independent airline serving much of Nebraska, estimates that nearly 40% of its revenues come from the subsidies that, in some cases, exceed the cost of a ticket.
03/wsj_0328:But given the few number of users, the cost to the federal government per passenger is estimated at $193, according to House and Senate appropriations committees. 
03/wsj_0328:The same jealousy can breed confusion, however, in the absence of any authorization bill this year.
03/wsj_0329:Coda Energy Inc. said it arranged a $50 million credit facility with NCNB Texas National Bank, a unit of NCNB Corp., of Charlotte, N.C. 
03/wsj_0329:The Dallas oil and gas concern said that $10 million of the facility would be used to consolidate the company's $8.1 million of existing bank debt, to repurchase 4 million of its 4.9 million shares outstanding of Series D convertible preferred stock, and to purchase a 10% net-profits interest in certain oil and gas properties from one of its existing lenders, National Canada Corp.
03/wsj_0329:Ted Eubank, Coda's president, said the loan carries an interest rate of prime plus one percentage point, with 85% of the company's net oil and gas revenue each month dedicated to repayment.
03/wsj_0329:The company put up "virtually all" of its oil and gas properties as collateral, he said. 
03/wsj_0331:Santa Fe Pacific was the kind of story Wall Street loved. 
03/wsj_0331:Since the value of its assets wasn't known, analysts were free to pick a number.
03/wsj_0331:In one of many rosy scenarios, Bear Stearns's Gary Schneider wrote in March that its real estate alone had a value of $4.5 billion.
03/wsj_0331:With real estate experts Olympia & York and Samuel Zell's Itel owning close to 40% of Santa Fe's stock, management was under pressure -- in a favored phrase of Wall Street -- to quickly "maximize values." 
03/wsj_0331:And with the company's recent announcement that it is contemplating a partial sale of its real estate, the values suddenly look poorer. 
03/wsj_0331:Since the real estate unit also includes debt, the imputed value of the real estate itself is close to $3 billion. 
03/wsj_0331:"The implied current net asset value of 22.70 {per share} is well below the 30 level that the Street believed," PaineWebber says. "The upside was in the intangible real estate . . . which is no longer an intangible." 
03/wsj_0331:If the railroad is valued on a private market basis -- at the same multiple of earnings as in the recent sale of CNW -- it would have a value of $1.65 billion.
03/wsj_0331:Its plan, instead, is to spin off the remainder of its real estate unit and to possibly do the same with its mining and energy assets. 
03/wsj_0331:Robert D. Krebs, Santa Fe's chairman, argues that since its businesses are valued in different ways, "the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole." 
03/wsj_0331:Salomon Brothers says, "We believe the real estate properties would trade at a discount . . . after the realty unit is spun off. . . . And what about the cost, and risk, of waiting to realize the hypothetical private market values?" 
03/wsj_0331:Mr. Schneider of Bear Stearns says he is recalculating the worth of the company's assets and, in the meantime, is sticking to his "buy" recommendation on the belief that he will find "values" of 30 a share.
03/wsj_0331:First Boston's Graeme Anne Lidgerwood values Santa Fe at 24, down from her earlier estimate of 29.
03/wsj_0331:Her recent report classifies the stock as a "hold." But it appears to be the sort of hold one makes while heading for the door. 
03/wsj_0331:Since most of the unit's real estate is in California, the pension fund will be a useful political ally in a state where development is often held hostage to zoning boards.
03/wsj_0331:So despite Wall Street's rosy talk of quickly "maximizing values," holders could be in for a long wait. 
03/wsj_0331:Net income: 21 cents a share vs. net loss of $4.11 a share 
03/wsj_0332:Orkem S.A., a French state-controlled chemical manufacturer, is making a friendly bid of 470 pence ($7.43) a share for the 59.2% of U.K. specialty chemical group Coates Brothers PLC which it doesn't already own, the two sides said. 
03/wsj_0332:The offer, which values the whole of Coates at #301 million, has already been accepted by Coates executives and other shareholders owning 12.4% of the company.
03/wsj_0332:The takeover would be followed by a restructuring of Orkem's U.K. unit, including the addition of related Orkem businesses and possibly further acquisitions.
03/wsj_0333:Intelogic Trace Inc. said it is exploring alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including the possible sale of the company. 
03/wsj_0333:But Asher B. Edelman, who controls about 16% of the San Antonio, Texas, computer-servicing company, insisted that the announcement didn't have anything to do with the ongoing battle for control of Datapoint Corp. 
03/wsj_0333:Any sale of Intelogic could have an impact on the battle between Mr. Edelman and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint.
03/wsj_0333:Intelogic holds 27.5% of Datapoint's common shares outstanding. 
03/wsj_0333:Mr. Edelman said the decision "has nothing to do with Marty Ackerman." Mr. Ackerman contended that it was a direct response to his efforts to gain control of Datapoint. 
03/wsj_0333:Intelogic was spun off from Datapoint four years ago, shortly after Mr. Edelman took control of Datapoint. 
03/wsj_0334:Marks & Spencer PLC reported a 12% gain in first-half pretax profit, mainly because of improving performances in the U.K. and continental Europe. 
03/wsj_0334:Marks declared an interim per-share dividend of 1.85 pence, compared with 1.7 pence a year earlier. 
03/wsj_0335:Federal and state thrift examiners said they saw evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the collapse of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, and a California regulator described an attempted "whitewash" by deputies of chief federal regulator Danny Wall. 
03/wsj_0335:In a riveting day of hearings before the House Banking Committee, the examiners described finding shredded documents, a mysterious Panamanian subsidiary, millions of dollars funneled into a Swiss bank, and a complacent attitude by Mr. Wall's deputies, one of whom was portrayed as acting more like a public-relations man for the thrift than a federal regulator. 
03/wsj_0335:A California official also said he sent the Federal Bureau of Investigation a packet of documents relating to a previously reported $400,000 contribution from Lincoln's parent solicited by Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.). 
03/wsj_0335:"I think there's overwhelming evidence to indicate probable criminal activity," said Mr. Meek, who participated last year in an examination of the Irvine, Calif., thrift.
03/wsj_0335:He said 30% of the loans he sampled were "dead meat on the day they were made." 
03/wsj_0335:The state examiner also said supervisors of a parallel federal examination seemed so reluctant to demand write-downs of Lincoln's bad loans that he immediately grew suspicious. 
03/wsj_0335:"Those who testified {yesterday} have consistently maintained that anyone who didn't agree with them is part of a coverup, a whitewash, or the subject of excessive influence," Mr. Bickwit said. "We simply don't agree with that or the findings of their investigation." 
03/wsj_0335:Mr. Wall's deputies complained that they hadn't been given an opportunity to respond to the criticism brought out during the Banking Committee's hearings, which Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) has used as a forum to flay Mr. Wall's handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside from his job. 
03/wsj_0335:"A couple of things Mr. Newsom said were at least misleading," said Kevin O'Connell, one of the Washington regulators responsible for the handling of Lincoln.
03/wsj_0335:In an interview, he said federal regulators eventually declared one of the loans the state regulator cited to be a total loss, and forced Lincoln to make an $18 million downward adjustment on another. 
03/wsj_0335:Rep. Gonzalez has complained that regulators waited far too long, however, ignoring a recommendation from regional officials to place Lincoln into receivership two years before it failed. "He took the reckless course of ignoring the evidence," Rep. Gonzalez said. 
03/wsj_0335:State thrift examiner Eugene Stelzer said he found the chief federal examiner Steve Scott to be totally uninterested in one allegedly fraudulent series of transactions. "Frankly, it was like he worked for the Lincoln public-relations department," Mr. Stelzer testified.
03/wsj_0335:Mr. Meek said that a day or two before Lincoln's parent entered bankruptcy proceedings, he and other examiners saw "a truck with a sign on it that said it was from the `Document Destruction Center. ' We observed at least two large plastic bags of shredded paper loaded into this truck." 
03/wsj_0335:Mr. Meek said his suspicions were aroused by several foreign investments by Lincoln, including $22 million paid to Credit Suisse of Switzerland, an $18 million interest in Saudi European Bank in Paris, a $17.5 million investment in a Bahamas trading company, and a recently discovered holding in a Panama-based company, Southbrook Holdings.
03/wsj_0336:LTV Steel Co. is boosting the prices of flat rolled steel products by an average of 3% following a recent erosion in the prices of such crucial steel products. 
03/wsj_0336:Major steel producers are selling cold rolled sheet steel at about $370 a ton, compared with a peak price of $520 a ton in 1988.
03/wsj_0336:LTV confirmed the price-increase plan, saying the move is designed to more accurately reflect the value of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities.
03/wsj_0336:A spokesman for LTV Steel, which is a unit of Dallas-based LTV Corp., noted that steel prices, adjusted for inflation, increased only 1.7% between 1981 and the fourth quarter of 1988, while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much.
03/wsj_0336:Both companies are in the process of negotiating contracts with LTV and others. 
03/wsj_0336:Steelmakers announced a round of base-price increases last year, but began offering sizable discounts over the summer.
03/wsj_0336:In fact, LTV was the first steelmaker to publicly boost discounts for buyers of cold rolled sheet steel and hot-dipped galvanized sheet steel. 
03/wsj_0337:The Treasury plans to raise $2.3 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about $16 billion in short-term bills to redeem $13.71 billion in maturing bills. 
03/wsj_0337:However, the Treasury said it will postpone the auction unless it has assurances of enactment of legislation to raise the statutory debt limit before the scheduled auction date. 
03/wsj_0338:Shop Television Network Inc., of Los Angeles, said Penney agreed to continue its exclusive arrangement with Shop Television, which does the production, marketing and cable distribution for the J.C. Penney Television Shopping Channel.
03/wsj_0338:Michael Rosen, president of Shop Television, said Penney decided to extend its involvement with the service for at least five years.
03/wsj_0339:(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 
03/wsj_0339:In 1953, James Watson and his colleagues unlocked the double helix of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the genetic key to heredity.
03/wsj_0339:With $500 apiece and an injection of outside capital, they formed Genentech Inc. Commercial gene-splicing was born. 
03/wsj_0339:The next to be cloned, human insulin, had market potential and Genentech licensed it to Eli Lilly, which produced 80% of the insulin used by 1.5 million U.S. diabetics. 
03/wsj_0339:At the time, Genentech had only one profitable year behind it (a modest $116,000 on revenue of $2.6 million in 1979) and no product of its own on the market.
03/wsj_0339:Gene-splicing now is an integral part of the drug business.
03/wsj_0340:The portfolio unit of the French bank group Credit Lyonnais told stock market regulators that it bought 43,000 shares of Cie. de Navigation Mixte, apparently to help fend off an unwelcome takeover bid for the company. 
03/wsj_0340:Earlier yesterday, the Societe de Bourses Francaises was told that a unit of Framatome S.A. also bought Navigation Mixte shares, this purchase covering more than 160,000 shares. 
03/wsj_0340:Both companies are allies of Navigation Mixte in its fight against a hostile takeover bid launched last week by Cie.
03/wsj_0341:The joint venture, Uno-Ven Co., would generate total annual revenue of about $500 million and have 1,100 employees, a Unocal spokesman said.
03/wsj_0341:Unocal said the venture would enable it to recover more of its refining and marketing investment and prepare for expected growth in exploration, production, chemicals and other areas. 
03/wsj_0341:It said financing would consist of $250 million from a private placement obtained through Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and a $150 million revolving credit line underwritten by Chase Manhattan Bank. 
03/wsj_0341:It said the venture, expected to take control of the facilities Dec. 1, would also serve another 3,300 independent Unocal gasoline stations.
03/wsj_0341:Petroleos will supply 135,000 barrels of oil a day for the refinery, Unocal said. 
03/wsj_0342:Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. said unconsolidated pretax earnings in the fiscal first half surged 79% to a record 63.25 billion yen ($445.7 million), reflecting strong demand for a variety of products. 
03/wsj_0342:A year ago, the Tokyo company had pretax profit of 35.38 billion yen. 
03/wsj_0342:Company officials said the current robust domestic demand that has been fueling sustained economic expansion helped push up sales of products like ships, steel structures, power systems and machinery and resulted in sharply higher profit. 
03/wsj_0343:The talks between Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine and his GOP counterpart, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, are expected to resume today. 
03/wsj_0343:Last night, after meeting with Mr. Bush and administration officials at the White House, Mr. Dole proposed streamlining the fiscal 1990 deficit-reduction bill, now stalled in a House-Senate conference committee, and passing a long-term extension of the federal debt ceiling without any accompanying amendments. 
03/wsj_0343:Under this plan, two provisions currently in the House version of the deficit-cutting bill -- repeal of both the catastrophic-illness insurance program and a controversial 1986 tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee-benefit plans -- would be made into a separate bill. 
03/wsj_0343:Republicans would try to attach a capital-gains provision to that legislation, hoping the political popularity of its other two parts would dissuade Democrats from blocking it. 
03/wsj_0343:Both plans would drop child-care provisions from the House version of the deficit-reduction legislation and let it progress as a separate bill.
03/wsj_0343:Yesterday, Mr. Dole seemed weary of the Bush administration's strategy of pushing the capital-gains measure at every chance in the face of Democratic procedural hurdles.
03/wsj_0343:Pressed by Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee, Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber told a congressional hearing that the administration would give up its demand for the capital-gains tax cut if faced with a potential default. 
03/wsj_0344:Price Stern Sloan Inc. said it hired an investment banking firm to assist in evaluating restructuring or merger alternatives and reported a net loss of $8.1 million, or $2.14 a share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 
03/wsj_0344:These results compare with net income of $1.8 million, or 44 cents a share, for the corresponding period last year.
03/wsj_0344:This quarter's loss includes pretax charges of $4.9 million on the proposed discontinuation of the company's troubled British subsidiary, and $3.7 million of other write-offs the company said were non-recurring and principally related to inventory, publishing advances and pre-publication costs.
03/wsj_0344:The publishing concern said it retained the investment banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Inc. to act as its financial adviser, assisting in the evaluation of various financial and strategic alternatives, including debt refinancing, raising capital, recapitalization, a merger or sale of the company. 
03/wsj_0344:The company also retained attorney Martin P. Levin, a director of the company and former head of the Times-Mirror Publishing Group, as an adviser. 
03/wsj_0344:The company attributed the decrease in part to the exclusion of the company's British sales from the current year's figures as a result of the subsidiary's status as a proposed discontinued operation and, in part, to lower sales in certain key foreign and domestic accounts.
03/wsj_0345:Paper and forest-products stocks were especially strong, as the offer for Great Northern Nekoosa by Georgia-Pacific triggered speculation that the industry could be in for a wave of merger activity. 
03/wsj_0345:At one point, almost all of the shares in the 20-stock Major Market Index, which mimics the industrial average, were sharply higher. 
03/wsj_0345:Great Northern surged 20 1/8 to 62 7/8, well above Georgia-Pacific's offering price of $58 a share, amid speculation that other suitors for the company would surface or that the bid would be raised.
03/wsj_0345:Nearly 6.3 million shares, or about 11.5% of the company's shares outstanding, changed hands in Big Board composite trading. 
03/wsj_0345:With stocks having been battered lately because of the collapse of takeover offers for UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, analysts viewed the proposal as a psychological lift for the market. 
03/wsj_0345:The $3.18 billion bid, which had been rumored since last week, "creates a better feeling that there's value in the market at current levels and renews prospects for a hot tape," says A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research Corp. 
03/wsj_0345:Traders and analysts alike said the market's surge also reflected an easing of concerns about volatility because of moves by a number of brokerage firms to curtail or cease stock-index arbitrage.
03/wsj_0345:Much of the instability in stock prices lately has been blamed on arbitrage trading, designed to profit from differences in prices between stocks and index futures. 
03/wsj_0345:"People are looking for an ability to try and read the market, rather than be manipulated," said Dudley A. Eppel, manager of equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
03/wsj_0345:But traders also said arbitrage-related trading contributed to the market's surge, as buy programs boosted prices shortly after the opening and sporadically through the remainder of the session. 
03/wsj_0345:The theme of industry consolidation had surfaced earlier this year among drug stocks, which posted solid gains in the latest session.
03/wsj_0345:An advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration recommended that the agency approve Eminase, the company's heart drug.

03/wsj_0345:Paramount Communications, which completed the $3.35 billion sale of its Associates Corp. financial-services unit to Ford Motor, gained 1 1/8 to 55 7/8 after losing one point Monday amid rumors of a delay.
03/wsj_0345:The upgrade reflected the 20% decline in shares of the bank since the firm lowered its rating in early October, based on the belief the stock had become expensive.
03/wsj_0345:The company said it would repurchase half of its common shares at $70 each, sell an estimated $1.1 billion in assets and pay a special preferred-stock dividend to common-stock holders. 
03/wsj_0345:Ocean Drilling & Research dropped 1 1/4 to 21 1/2 following news of a restructuring plan that calls for the company to reorganize its drilling business into a separate company and offer a 15% to 20% stake to the public.

03/wsj_0346:Cilcorp Inc., Peoria, Ill., said it agreed to acquire the environmental consulting and analytical service businesses of Hunter Environmental Services Inc. of Southport, Conn. 
03/wsj_0346:The utility holding company said Hunter will receive 390,000 shares of a new series of Cilcorp convertible preferred stock with a face value of $39 million for the businesses.
03/wsj_0346:Cilcorp will also assume $22 million of Hunter's existing debt.
03/wsj_0346:As part of the agreement, Cilcorp said it will pay Hunter $4 million in exchange for agreements not to compete. 
03/wsj_0346:Cilcorp said the businesses to be acquired had revenue of $76 million for the year ended March 31. 
03/wsj_0346:Separately, Cilcorp said it plans to purchase as many as 1.4 million shares, or 10% of its common stock outstanding from time to time on the open market and through privately negotiated transactions.

03/wsj_0349:The exchange also may step up its disclosure of firms engaged in program trading, these people said. 
03/wsj_0349:Mr. Phelan said that the Big Board has been trying to deal quietly with the issue, but that banning computer-assisted trading strategies entirely, as some investors want, would be like "taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse." 
03/wsj_0349:Mr. Phelan hasn't been making public remarks in recent days, and many people have urged him to take more of a leadership role on the program trading issue. 
03/wsj_0349:"The collar was penetrated on a number of occasions," meaning securities firms figured out ways to conduct program trades to circumvent the collar and use the Big Board's electronic trading system, Mr. Phelan said.
03/wsj_0349:Exchange officials emphasized that the Big Board is considering a variety of actions to deal with program trading.
03/wsj_0349:People familiar with the exchange said another idea likely to be approved is expanding the monthly reports on program trading to cover specific days or even hours of heavy program trading and who was doing it. 
03/wsj_0349:In stock-index arbitrage, traders buy and sell large amounts of stock with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies between the two markets. 
03/wsj_0349:Also, CS First Boston Inc. 's First Boston Corp. unit, the fifth-biggest program trader in September, is "preparing a response" to the program-trading outcry, officials of the firm said.
03/wsj_0349:First Boston is one of the few major Wall Street firms that haven't pulled back from program trading in recent days. 
03/wsj_0349:Mr. Phelan is an adroit diplomat who normally appears to be solidly in control of the Big Board's factions.
03/wsj_0349:If bringing the message is a crime, I'm guilty of it." But he said this doesn't mean he is satisfied with the market's big swings. 
03/wsj_0349:"We're trying to take care of a heck of a lot of constituents," Mr. Phelan said. "Each one has a different agenda." 
03/wsj_0349:For example, in a special meeting Monday with Mr. Phelan, senior officials of some of the Big Board's 49 stock specialist firms complained that the exchange is no longer representing their interests. "We are looking for representation we haven't had," a specialist said. "We've had dictation." 
03/wsj_0349:After another session Mr. Phelan held yesterday with major brokerage firms such as Morgan Stanley & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co., PaineWebber Group Inc. and First Boston -- all of which have engaged in program trading -- an executive of a top brokerage firm said, "Clearly, the firms want the exchange to take leadership." 
03/wsj_0349:The basket product, while it has got off to a slow start, is being supported by some big brokerage firms -- another member of Mr. Phelan's splintered constituency. 
03/wsj_0349:Mr. Phelan has had difficulty convincing the public that the Big Board is serious about curbing volatility, especially as the exchange clearly relishes its role as the home for $200 billion in stock-index funds, which buy huge baskets of stocks to mimic popular stock-market indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500, and which sometimes employ program trading.
03/wsj_0349:What I'm trying to say to people is, it's proper to worry about program trading, but it's only a piece of the business." 
03/wsj_0349:For example, Mr. Phelan said that big institutions have so much control over public investments that they can cause big swings in the market, regardless of index arbitrage. "A lot of people would like to go back to 1970," before program trading, he said. "I would like to go back to 1970.
03/wsj_0349:Indeed, Mr. Phelan said that if stock-market volatility persists, the U.S. may lose its edge as being the best place to raise capital. "Japan's markets are more stable," he said. "If that continues, a significant number of {U.S.} companies will go over there to raise money." 
03/wsj_0349:Lewis L. Glucksman, vice chairman of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said: "This is a problem that's taking on a life of its own.
03/wsj_0349:The program trading situation seems to have driven individual investors as well as others out of the market, and even Europeans are suspicious.
03/wsj_0350:Great Northern Nekoosa reacted coolly to Georgia-Pacific's takeover bid of $58 a share, or $3.19 billion, though the suitor said all terms are negotiable.
03/wsj_0350:Leading indicators rose a slight 0.2% in September, a further indication the economy is slowing but without any clear sign of whether a recession looms.
03/wsj_0350:Time Warner and Sony could end up becoming partners in several business ventures as part of a settlement of their dispute over Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters. 
03/wsj_0350:A bidding war for Jaguar became more likely as Britain unexpectedly decided to end restrictions blocking a takeover of the luxury car maker. 
03/wsj_0350:Sea Containers plans to sell $1.1 billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about 50% of its common shares for $70 each.
03/wsj_0350:LTV Steel is boosting prices of flat rolled steel products an average 3%, but it's unclear whether the increases, set for Jan. 1, 1990, will stick. 
03/wsj_0351:Bond prices staggered in seesaw trading, rising on reports of economic weakness and falling on reports of economic strength. 
03/wsj_0351:When U.S. trading began, Treasury bonds received an additional boost from news that sales of new single-family homes fell 14% in September.
03/wsj_0351:But later in the day, a report by the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago cast doubt on the recession scenario.
03/wsj_0351:The association said its October index of economic activity rose to 51.6% after having been below 50% for three consecutive months.
03/wsj_0351:By the end of the day, bond prices were mixed.
03/wsj_0351:The giant computer maker is slated to offer $500 million of 30-year non-callable debentures through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. Traders expect the bonds to yield about 0.60 to 0.65 percentage point above the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which ended Tuesday with a yield of about 7.90%. 
03/wsj_0351:The last time IBM tapped the corporate debt market was in April 1988, when it offered $500 million of debt securities. 
03/wsj_0351:The boost in rates sent IBM's bonds tumbling, leaving underwriters with millions of dollars of losses and triggering a sell-off in the overall market. 
03/wsj_0351:Others said IBM might increase the size of the offering to as much as $1 billion if investor demand is strong.
03/wsj_0351:"I think the $500 million is a little bit of a fire drill," said Jim Ednee, head of the industrial bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "I think as the pricing time arrives, the bonds will come a little richer and in a larger amount." 
03/wsj_0351:The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose slightly from the average rate at Monday's auction to 7.79% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.04%.
03/wsj_0351:The discount rate on six-month Treasury bills fell slightly to 7.60% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.99%. 
03/wsj_0351:In the two-part offering, $151 million of senior subordinated reset notes were priced at 99.75 and carried a rate of 13 3/4%, while the $100 million of senior subordinated floating rate notes were priced to float at 4.25 percentage points above the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR.
03/wsj_0351:Since the recent deterioration of the junk-bond market, at least two other junk issuers have said they plan to scale back planned high-yield offerings, and several issues have been postponed. 
03/wsj_0351:Under the firm's original bank credit agreement, it was required to raise $250 million of subordinated debt to be used to repay some of the bank borrowings drawn to redeem $526.3 million of increasing rate debentures in August. 
03/wsj_0351:A month ago, when Beatrice first filed to sell debt, the company had planned to offer $200 million of its senior subordinated reset notes at a yield of 12 3/4%.
03/wsj_0351:By October, however, market conditions had deteriorated and the reset notes were targeted to be offered at a yield of between 13 1/4% and 13 1/2%. 
03/wsj_0351:Continental Cablevision Inc., via underwriters at Morgan Stanley & Co., priced $350 million of junk bonds at par to yield 12 7/8%. 
03/wsj_0351:J.C. Penney & Co. issued $350 million of securities backed by credit-card receivables.
03/wsj_0351:On the pricing front, an 11-class issue of $500 million Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Remic mortgage securities was launched by a Morgan Stanley group.
03/wsj_0351:The offering is backed by Freddie Mac's 10% issue with a weighted average term to maturity of 29.583 months. 
03/wsj_0351:There's light at the end of the tunnel for municipals," he said, adding that he expects prices to "inch up" in the near term. 
03/wsj_0351:The market's tone improved after Monday's pricing of $813 million New York City general obligation bonds.
03/wsj_0351:Demand for the bonds was strong enough to permit underwriters to trim some yields in the tax-exempt portion of the offering late Monday. 
03/wsj_0351:A two-part $75.1 million offering of wastewater treatment bonds by the New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Trust was more than half sold by late in the session, according to lead underwriter Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 
03/wsj_0351:In a speech given Friday but released late Monday, Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger suggested that it was risky to claim that the booming German economy has reached the peak of its cycle.
03/wsj_0351:British government bonds were little changed as investors awaited an address on economic policy by John Major, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer.
03/wsj_0352:Paramount Communications Inc. said it sold two Simon & Schuster information services units to Macmillan Inc., a subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corp. 
03/wsj_0352:Arthur H. Rosenfeld, previously president of the Prentice Hall Tax and Professional Services division, was named president of the newly formed Macmillan Professional and Business Reference division. 
03/wsj_0352:Simon & Schuster retains the Corporation Law looseleaf service, which will become part of its Prentice Hall Law & Business unit. 
03/wsj_0353:A governing body of both the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board voted to give the FASB jurisdiction over accounting standards for certain government-owned entities. 
03/wsj_0353:The foundation vote is effective for the affected government entities with fiscal years that begin starting next Jan. 1 and makes the financial results of the hospitals, colleges and schools easier to compare with for-profit businesses.
03/wsj_0353:"Managers of government entities are often more concerned with the political and legal structure and financial-report comparability with profit-making businesses isn't always as high a priority," a foundation spokesman said. 
03/wsj_0354:Avery Inc. said it completed the sale of Uniroyal Chemical Holding Co. to a group led by management of Uniroyal Chemical Co., the unit's main business.
03/wsj_0354:Avery, which continues to operate a coal company it expects to sell at a loss, said in proxy materials it intends to seek control of one or more companies.
03/wsj_0354:After fees and repayment of debt, Avery is left with about $24 million in cash and securities from the Uniroyal sale.
03/wsj_0354:In over-the-counter trading, Avery shares were quoted yesterday at a bid price of 93.75 cents a share. 
03/wsj_0354:According to Avery, for the year ended Sept. 30, 1988, Uniroyal Chemical had sales of $734.2 million and a net loss of $47.1 million.
03/wsj_0354:Peltz and May sold their stock in Triangle Industries Inc., a packaging company they controlled, to Pechiney Corp. of France.
03/wsj_0354:In January 1989, the two men acquired the non-packaging assets of Triangle, including a controlling stake in Avery and, by extension, Uniroyal Chemical.
03/wsj_0355:Clarcor, a maker of packaging and filtration products, said the two companies couldn't agree on terms of a definitive agreement.
03/wsj_0355:The sale price of the unit, which makes packaging products, was to consist of cash, notes and an amount to be determined by the unit's future performance. 
03/wsj_0355:Clarcor said it is inviting proposals from other prospective purchasers of the unit. 
03/wsj_0356:The plan provides for the distribution of one common stock-purchase right as a dividend for each share of common outstanding.
03/wsj_0356:Each right entitles shareholders to buy one-half share of common for $30. 
03/wsj_0356:Earlier this month, a group led by three of the company's directors, Burt Sugarman, James M. Trotter III and Willam E. Trotter II, indicated it had a 45.2% stake in the Louisville, Ky., fast-food company and that it planned to seek a majority of seats on Rally's nine-member board. 
03/wsj_0356:The company said it was "concerned about the announced intent to acquire control of the company" by a Sugarman-led group. 
03/wsj_0357:Fujitsu Ltd. said it wants to withdraw its controversial one-yen bid to design a waterworks computer system for the city of Hiroshima. 
03/wsj_0357:Meanwhile, Japan's Fair Trade Commission said it was considering launching an investigation into whether the bid, the equivalent of less than a penny, violates anti-monopoly laws. 
03/wsj_0357:News of the bid drew sharp criticism from other computer companies and industry observers.
03/wsj_0357:They said they wanted to wait for the outcome of any government investigation before deciding what to do. 
03/wsj_0358:The city's Department of Consumer Affairs charged Newmark & Lewis Inc. with failing to deliver on its promise of lowering prices. 
03/wsj_0358:In a civil suit commenced in state Supreme Court in New York, the agency alleged that the consumer-electronics and appliance discount-retailing chain engaged in deceptive advertising by claiming to have "lowered every price on every item" as part of an advertising campaign that began June 1. 
03/wsj_0358:The agency said it monitored Newmark & Lewis's advertised prices before and after the ad campaign, and found that the prices of at least 50 different items either increased or stayed the same. 
03/wsj_0358:In late May, Newmark & Lewis announced a plan to cut prices 5% to 20% and eliminate what it called a "standard discount-retailing practice" of negotiating individual deals with customers. 
03/wsj_0358:The consumer agency also disputed Newmark & Lewis's continuing strategy of advertising "new lower prices" when allgedly there haven't been price reductions since June 1. 
03/wsj_0358:Richard D. Lewis, president of the 47-store chain, defended the company's pricing campaign, saying it didn't use "the misleading expression `reduced from original prices. '" Mr. Lewis said the company marked price tags and advertised at its "lowest possible prices" for all its merchandise to reduce public confusion. 
03/wsj_0358:Mr. Lewis said the company gave the Consumer Affairs department "volumes of documents" to substantiate its statements, and made "every effort to comply" with all the agency's policies. 
03/wsj_0358:In its suit, the consumer agency seeks fines of $1,000 per violation of the city's Consumer Protection Law, costs of investigation, and an injunction to prevent Newmark & Lewis from continuing its allegedly deceptive advertising. 
03/wsj_0359:Wary investors have been running for the stock market's equivalent of bomb shelters, buying shares of gold-mining and utility companies. 
03/wsj_0359:Those two groups have recently been leading the list of stocks setting new highs.
03/wsj_0359:Indeed, that happened to some extent yesterday, as industrial stocks rebounded, partly on news of takeovers in the paper industry. 
03/wsj_0359:Still, a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares. "The primary overriding thing is that people are frightened," says Martin Sass, a New York money manager. "The aftershocks of Oct. 13 (when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190 points) are still reverberating." 
03/wsj_0359:Britain's unsettled political scene also worries some investors. "The gyrations in the British government" add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market, says John Hoffman, assistant director of research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "One of the three major markets in the world is getting chewed up pretty bad." 
03/wsj_0359:With this sort of sentiment common, it's natural for investors to seek out "defensive" investments.
03/wsj_0359:But many of these stocks have now become expensive.
03/wsj_0359:Even utility stocks aren't all that inexpensive, at an average of 14 times earnings.
03/wsj_0359:One reason for his gloom is a weekly tally he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or lows.
03/wsj_0359:But by Mr. Granville's count, 493 issues were within one point of such lows. 
03/wsj_0359:Robert Stovall, a veteran New York money manager and president of Stovall/ Twenty-First Securities, has money in both gold and utility issues. "I think we could very well have {an economic} slowdown, beginning very soon if not already," he says. 
03/wsj_0359:But he does expect "a muffler dragger" of an economy, with "very slow growth, maybe one quarter of no growth at all." In such a climate, utility stocks look good to him.
03/wsj_0359:The appeal of gold issues, Mr. Stovall says, is that "they're a counter group.
03/wsj_0359:Nevertheless, Mr. Stovall emphasizes that "you don't buy {gold stocks} based on powerful fundamentals." In addition to having high price-earnings ratios, most pay puny dividends, if any. "The earning power {of gold mining companies} is restricted unless the gold price hops up over $425 an ounce," he says. 
03/wsj_0359:Abby Cohen, an investment strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert, also thinks it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold. "My outlook is for a decline of about 10% in corporate profits" in 1990, she says.
03/wsj_0359:But "a bunch of utilities" should post profit increases.
03/wsj_0360:To suggest that a 10% drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted.
03/wsj_0360:Crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were 10 years ago.
03/wsj_0360:This is a fact and not the product of some environmental doomsayer or a group's ploy to create a market. 
03/wsj_0360:As an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer, I have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the Rowland-Molina theory (named after the researchers who found in 1974 that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth's atmosphere) and the Montreal Protocol.
03/wsj_0360:An important part of my effort has been to understand the science so I can explain it to corporate colleagues facing major changes in product design. 
03/wsj_0360:In my research, I have found a paper by Joseph Scotto of the National Cancer Institute and several colleagues reporting an 11-year decrease in UV-B radiation at eight U.S. measurement sites. 
03/wsj_0360:Our concern for the ozone layer, of course, grows out of the potential for increasing UV-B radiation, which could damage flora and fauna.
03/wsj_0360:The last of the measurements reported was in 1985, but recent conversations with Mr. Scotto indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend.
03/wsj_0360:To me, this calls into question the validity of the Rowland-Molina theory and hence the whole chlorofluorocarbons replacement effort.
03/wsj_0360:This, in turn, threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written.
03/wsj_0360:My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the National Resource Development Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, Friends of the Earth, etc. were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited.
03/wsj_0360:When I expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible UV-B study, I was urged to get back to the agenda topic, which was, ironically, a schedule for getting rid of HCFCs, the so-called soft CFCs that are such an important part of the CFC substitution scenario. 
03/wsj_0360:Subsequently, I have learned that a private group, of which Du Pont is a part, is funding a modest program to continue data gathering at the Scotto report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated UVB measuring instruments.
03/wsj_0360:The topic never comes up in ozonedepletion "establishment" meetings, of which I have attended many. 
03/wsj_0360:It seems to me that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectually honest evaluation of the threat posed by CFCs.
03/wsj_0360:The relationship between surface release of CFCs and global stratospheric ozone loss was identified back in 1974.
03/wsj_0360:The discovery of the ozone "hole" over Antarctica and the results of ground-based and high-altitude aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to CFC concentrations. 
03/wsj_0360:In the September issue of Scientific American, Thomas E. Graedel, distinguished member of the technical staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories, and Paul J. Crutzen, director of the air chemistry division of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, West Germany, wrote, "It is now quite evident that chlorofluorocarbons, particularly CFC-11 and CFC-12 are the major culprits responsible for ozone depletion." Mr. Melloan quotes Peter Teagan and invokes the name of Arthur D. Little Inc. to support his statement.
03/wsj_0360:Graedel and Crutzen, who are both pioneers in the study of atmospheric chemistry, Mr. Teagan has no special expertise in the area.
03/wsj_0360:Solving the global environmental problems we all face will require an unprecedented level of cooperation and communication among industry, policy makers and the scientific community world-wide. 
03/wsj_0361:Nearly two months after saying it had been the victim of widespread fraud, MiniScribe Corp. disclosed it had a negative net worth of $88 million as of July 2 and hinted that it might be forced to file for protection under bankruptcy laws. 
03/wsj_0361:Richard Rifenburgh, chairman and chief executive of the Longmont, Colo., disk-drive maker, also said the company continued losing money in the third quarter and expects to sustain further losses through the end of the year. 
03/wsj_0361:Mr. Rifenburgh told industry analysts he is moving "aggressively" to negotiate out-of-court settlements on a number of shareholder lawsuits, but noted that the company could file for bankruptcy-law protection if settlement talks fail.
03/wsj_0361:Mr. Rifenburgh also noted that 150 million shares of MiniScribe common stock were traded during the past three years, "so there's a tremendous amount of exposure." 
03/wsj_0361:MiniScribe has said that its financial results for the past three fiscal years would have to be restated because of the allegedly fraudulent accounting and marketing practices that inflated revenues and net income. 
03/wsj_0361:Mr. Rifenburgh said such statements should be ready by the end of November.
03/wsj_0361:The release of MiniScribe's new balance sheet came one day after it introduced its new line of one-inch disk drives, on which it is pinning much of its hope for survival.
03/wsj_0361:Analysts and consultants had mixed reactions to yesterday's announcements, praising Mr. Rifenburgh's efforts but questioning whether the company can survive in a highly competitive marketplace. "It's a wait-and-see attitude," said Dave Vellante, vice president of storage research for International Data Corp. Others pointed out that at least four other disk-drive makers will have competitive one-inch drives early next year and that the industry already operates on very thin margins. 
03/wsj_0361:The company also faces delisting by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
03/wsj_0361:MiniScribe filed a status report with the NASD on Monday, detailing its efforts to comply with listing requirements and requesting an extension of the exception, but hasn't received a response.
03/wsj_0361:The MiniScribe report outlines a host of allegedly fraudulent practices, including the shipment of bricks and defective disk drives that were booked as sales, and inventory forgeries in accounting records.
03/wsj_0361:Mr. Rifenburgh said the board still hasn't acted on most of the internal report's recommendations, pending restatement of the balance sheet.
03/wsj_0362:By concentrating all their resources on the pay raise, Wright and Tower, the networks actually overlooked some major stories that showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution. . . . An imaginative producer could easily have created a fast-moving and interesting piece about how Congress really works -- and why voters in, say, West Virginia got a federally funded university project and building while voters in Arkansas did not.
03/wsj_0362:But nobody did such a piece, reflecting a contemporary axiom: the more a scandal has to do with a congressman's duties as a congressman, the less likely it is to catch the fancy of a network. 
03/wsj_0362:Ethicist Michael Josephson, in one of his institute's recent publications on "Journalism: In the Year 2000": 
03/wsj_0362:The operative definition of newsworthiness will favor virtually unrestrained use of personal, sensitive and intimate facts.
03/wsj_0362:Traditional standards of relevancy and importance ("is this something the public ought to know") will be replaced by a much broader test ("is this something the public is interested in knowing").
03/wsj_0362:And, since the public has always been fascinated by gossip and voyeurism, reporters and editors will strain for creative angles to justify the inclusion of collateral facts about private lives including sexual activities and domestic relationships, activities of family members, and all matters about mental and physical health.
03/wsj_0362:One consequence of the trend toward tabloid standards of taste will be fierce attacks from politicians who will find sufficient evidence of abuse to arouse an already cynical public to control the press. 
03/wsj_0363:The seemingly mundane action, which was opposed by the Securities Industry Association, a trade group, has important implications for banks' recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities.
03/wsj_0363:The Fed's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks' securities affiliates will be able to underwrite.
03/wsj_0363:Over the past two years, the Fed has given a handful of banks' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate, asset-backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms.
03/wsj_0363:However, the Fed limited the revenue that banks could earn from these new underwriting activities to no more than 10% of the revenue earned from other securities activities long open to banks, such as dealing in U.S. Treasurys. 
03/wsj_0363:But, by allowing BT Securities Inc. to handle private placements, the Fed boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the unit can do. 
03/wsj_0363:Private placements involve debt and equity securities, typically in denominations of $1 million, that are sold to institutional investors and aren't registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
03/wsj_0363:Last year, Bankers Trust said it placed $10 billion of corporate debt and equities privately. 
03/wsj_0364:Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
03/wsj_0365:Bonnie J. Stedt was named an executive vice president of the American Express Travel Related Services Co. unit of this travel and financial services firm.
03/wsj_0365:She retains her duties of human-resources director. 
03/wsj_0366:Joe F. Lynch, the 56-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of First Continental Real Estate Investment Trust, was named to the new post of vice chairman of this bank holding company. 
03/wsj_0367:As many as 50 of his employees at Specialized Bicycle Components Inc. ride with him.
03/wsj_0367:Such fervor for cycling helped Mr. Sinyard build a creative company at the forefront of its industry.
03/wsj_0367:Founded by bike enthusiasts rather than businessmen, Specialized spotted the appeal of fat-tired bikes that go almost anywhere and began mass-producing them in 1981.
03/wsj_0367:Today, so-called mountain bikes account for two-thirds of the $2 billion spent annually on all bicycles in the U.S.
03/wsj_0367:With 65% of its sales coming from mountain bikes, Specialized is widely considered to be a market leader. (Accessories, largely for mountain-bike users, account for much of the rest of sales.) 
03/wsj_0367:Thus, Mr. Sinyard's company must innovate more than ever to stay ahead of them, by developing new products specifically for mountain biking.
03/wsj_0367:Mr. Eidsmo is one of several key people from outside the cycling industry who were hired to bring the free-wheeling, fast-growing company under tighter control. "We had a lot of problems," Mr. Sinyard says.
03/wsj_0367:Since his arrival in May, Mr. Eidsmo has put in place techniques learned while working for Citicorp, such as management-by-objective, detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends. "We're finally getting -- and it's been very painful -- some understanding of what the company's long-term horizon should begin to look like," Mr. Eidsmo says. "But it's risky," he says of Specialized's attempt to adopt a corporate structure. "You don't want to lose the magic" of the company's creative drive. 
03/wsj_0367:Hoping to stay ahead of the pack, the company is emphasizing innovation.
03/wsj_0367:By replacing the frame's steel lugs with titanium ones, Mr. Sinyard's company plans to make its next generation of frames even lighter. 
03/wsj_0367:At the trade show, Specialized also unveiled a revolutionary three-spoked bike wheel developed jointly by Specialized and Du Pont Co. Made of space-age materials, the wheel spokes are designed like airplane wings to shave 10 minutes off the time of a rider in a 100-mile race, the company claims.
03/wsj_0367:He was able to slash the price of the company's least expensive mountain bike to $279 from $750 in 
03/wsj_0367:U.S. Cycling Federation official Philip Milburn says mountain biking is "growing at such a monstrous rate that a lot of companies are getting into this." 
03/wsj_0367:One especially coveted Specialized market the new players are targeting is mountain-bike accessories, which Mr. Eidsmo calls "the future of our business." Accessories not only sell faster than whole bikes, they also offer profit margins nearly double the 25% to 30% or so on sales of complete cycles.
03/wsj_0367:To get a piece of the business, Nike Inc., Beaverton, Ore., introduced a line of mountain-bike shoes.
03/wsj_0367:Competition in the sale of complete bikes is heating up too.
03/wsj_0367:Trek Bicycle Corp., which accounts for one-quarter of the $400 million in annual sales at its Milwaukee-based parent, Intrepid Corp., entered the mountain-bike business in 1983.
03/wsj_0367:The segment now makes up roughly two-thirds of his company's total sales. 
03/wsj_0367:A subsidiary of a Taiwanese holding company with world-wide sales of $150 million, Giant is one example of the sudden globalization of Mr. Sinyard's once-cozy market niche.
03/wsj_0367:In response to the internationalization of the business, Mr. Sinyard's company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries.
03/wsj_0367:The move will cut out the cost of a middleman and give Specialized more control over marketing and sales.
03/wsj_0367:But as Bill Austin, Giant's president, puts it, "With some of the bigger players consolidating their strength, the game has changed." 
03/wsj_0368:Carl E. Pfeiffer, chief executive officer, was named to the additional post of chairman of this specialty-metals manufacturing concern.
03/wsj_0368:Robert C. Snyder, a director and chief operating officer of the company, succeeds Mr. Pfeiffer as president. 
03/wsj_0369:Roger M. Marino, president, was named to the new post of vice chairman.
03/wsj_0370:Richard J. Riordan was elected a director of this single-family home builder, increasing the board to nine.
03/wsj_0370:He is a senior partner with the law firm of Riordan & McKinzie and is a partner in Riordan Venture Management. 
03/wsj_0371:John Franco, 47 years old, formerly vice chairman of Capital Holding Corp. and president of its Accumulation Investment Group, was named chief executive officer of this insurance holding company, effective Dec. 1, succeeding Robert T. Shaw, who remains chairman.

03/wsj_0372:The companies wouldn't disclose the length of the contract except to say it was a multiyear agreement. 
03/wsj_0373:The head of British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. said he hopes to raise about #450 million ($711 million) before the satellite-TV venture makes its delayed debut next spring -- with a major chunk coming from new investors. 
03/wsj_0373:He said he believes the bank loan, to be arranged by February, will supply about half of the financing.
03/wsj_0373:Continued uncertainty about the timing of the consortium's debut could make it hard to find a #450 million cash injection. 
03/wsj_0373:British Satellite today is unveiling a #30 million advertising and promotional drive for the consortium's planned five channels of movies, sports, entertainment and news shows.
03/wsj_0373:As part of the drive, the first 50,000 viewers who put up #10 each will get a package valued at #170 -- including a satellite receiving dish, equipment installation and a three-month subscription to its pay-movie service. 
03/wsj_0374:The index settled off the high of 2117.1 posted after Wall Street opened stronger.
03/wsj_0374:But it showed strength throughout the session, hitting a low of only 2102.2 within the first few minutes of dealings. 
03/wsj_0374:Volume was only 256.6 million shares, breaking the previous 1989 low of 276.8 million shares recorded Oct. 23.
03/wsj_0374:Dealers attributed most of the day's gains to market-makers moving prices higher, rather than an outbreak of significant buying interest.
03/wsj_0374:Though the market was stronger, dealers said fresh buying interest was sidelined ahead of a potential market-affecting debate in the House of Commons set for Tuesday.
03/wsj_0374:It will be Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major's first appearance before the opposition Labor Party.
03/wsj_0374:The market is keenly interested in hearing what he has to say about the status of the current 15% base lending rate. 
03/wsj_0374:It was the most active of the 100-share index at 8.3 million shares, 6.5 million of which were traded by midday. 
03/wsj_0374:Dealers said fresh buying was drawn into Jaguar after a senior executive of Daimler-Benz, the auto maker, told a British television interviewer during the weekend that the West German company held talks with the luxury auto maker over possible joint ventures.
03/wsj_0374:Glaxo was the biggest gainer, jumping 35 to #13.78 ($21.72) on anticipation of a stock split next week.
03/wsj_0374:In Tokyo, stocks had a second-consecutive loss Monday in quiet trading with the exception of concentrated buying in some incentive-backed issues. 
03/wsj_0374:The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues fell 109.85 points to 35417.44. 
03/wsj_0374:The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the First Section, which fell 15.82 points Friday, was down 5.16 points, or 0.19%, at 2676.60.
03/wsj_0374:The energy of participating investors streamed into Tokyu Group shares, pushing prices of its companies up across the board.
03/wsj_0374:Other winners Monday included nonferrous metals, which attracted investors because of a surge in gold prices on the back of the unstable dollar.
03/wsj_0374:Petroleum companies were also popular because of expectations of a weaker dollar, which cuts dollar-denominated crude-oil prices. 
03/wsj_0374:Another factor weighing on the Frankfurt market involves fears about the impending wage talks between the IG Metall metal-workers union and industry representatives, which could result in a wave of strikes next spring, traders said. 
03/wsj_0374:A few blue-chip stocks posted strong gains, boosted by special factors, while the majority of shares ended little changed. 
03/wsj_0374:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
03/wsj_0375:The maker of farm equipment said the three-year labor agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at John Deere Horicon Works, Deere's primary facility for producing lawn and grounds-care equipment, takes effect immediately and extends through Oct. 1, 1992.
03/wsj_0376:The establishment of the separate company, to be called Courtaulds Textiles, could be effective as early as next year's first quarter. 
03/wsj_0376:Courtaulds' spinoff reflects pressure on British industry to boost share prices beyond the reach of corporate raiders.
03/wsj_0376:The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of #50 million on #980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31. 
03/wsj_0377:Company officials said the new company, Sin Kean Boon-Sanwa (J.V.) is capitalized at the equivalent of 54 million yen ($381,000).
03/wsj_0378:Barbara Hackman Franklin, president of Franklin Associates, was elected a director of this building products maker.
03/wsj_0379:NEC Corp. said it plans to more than double its British subsidiary's capacity for the production of semiconductor wafers. 
03/wsj_0379:Officials also disclosed it's possible that NEC may reduce domestic production of one-megabit chips to five million a month from six million, beginning January, because of deteriorating market prices. 
03/wsj_0381:He'd cast the actress, not exactly known for her way with a song, as the singing star of "The Fabulous Baker Boys" -- and he wanted her to carry the tunes herself.
03/wsj_0381:"Most of what I do is very anonymous.
03/wsj_0381:And doing studio work has been a wonderful way to make a living for a long, long time," said Ms. Stevens, who for five years in a row received the Most Valuable Player award as a female studio vocalist from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the organization that hands out the Grammys. 
03/wsj_0381:Ms. Stevens's involvement with "Baker Boys" was the result of a long affiliation with the movie's composer, Dave Grusin. "I had written lyrics with him and had sung for him in various films and contracted voices for him," she said. "He knew my work and he called.
03/wsj_0381:When you approach a singer and tell her you don't want her to sing you always run the risk of offending.
03/wsj_0381:He said, `I don't know if this is going to be a compliment or an insult but . . .' Then he explained that Michelle was going to do this film and the role she was playing was that of a singer and they wanted very much for her to do her own singing if that was possible." At that point nobody, including Ms. Pfeiffer herself, was certain it would be possible. 
03/wsj_0381:She had, after all, sung in only one movie, "Grease II," and the vocal demands of "Baker Boys" -- singing standards with only a piano backup -- were considerably more imposing -- and exposing -- than belting out a rock 'n' roll score in concert with several other singers and instruments. 
03/wsj_0381:If Ms. Pfeiffer wasn't sure she was up to putting over numbers like "The Look of Love," "Ten Cents a Dance" and "My Funny Valentine," Ms. Stevens wasn't sure she was up to showing the way. "I had not done any coaching before," she said. "I have produced vocal performances in the studio for professional singers.
03/wsj_0381:One of the first lessons took place at the Cinegrill, a lounge in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel where Ms. Stevens brought Ms. Pfeiffer to hear a nightclub singer and soak up some atmosphere. "Her instincts were wonderfully astute," remembered Ms. Stevens, who is in her 40s. "Michelle sensed an undercurrent of anger in the singer's performance.
03/wsj_0381:I think it's true with a lot of club singers who haven't had the recognition they feel they deserve or that they had hoped for." Accordingly, Ms. Pfeiffer incorporated anger into the development of her character. 
03/wsj_0381:As for Ms. Pfeiffer's vocal development: For five or six weeks, Ms. Stevens made daily two-hour visits to the actress's Santa Monica home armed with sheet music, and on occasion albums by June Christy, Blossom Dearie and Ella Fitzgerald, artists Ms. Pfeiffer hadn't paid much mind to in the past. "I suggested Michelle listen to Ella," said Ms. Stevens. "Nobody sings better, not that I wanted her to sound like Ella but there's a quality artists of that period had that we felt the character Susie might have listened to." 
03/wsj_0381:Vowels were swallowed, word endings were given short or no shrift. "When we worked it almost became a joke with us that I was constantly reminding her to say the consonants as well as the vowels." To explain exactly what she meant, Ms. Stevens and Mr. Grusin went into a Los Angeles studio and recorded a vocal/piano demo of the songs being considered for inclusion in the movie so that Ms. Pfeiffer could learn the numbers, correct enunciation and all.
03/wsj_0381:What Ms. Pfeiffer had going for her besides determination -- Ms. Stevens recalled that the actress was up one night until 3 a.m. practicing "My Funny Valentine" -- was an airy alto, a nice breathy quality and intelligence. "When we first started working it was a matter of finding a language we both understood," Ms. Stevens said. "I couldn't talk with her as I would with someone who had a lot of vocal training." 
03/wsj_0381:So what Ms. Stevens talked about was the importance of saying the words at the front of the mouth with the lips and the teeth.
03/wsj_0381:She urged Ms. Pfeiffer to get the feeling of a smile in her throat and to put a smile on her face to give the pitch and the sound a lift.
03/wsj_0381:She kept harping on the importance of overdoing the consonants and percussive endings like "T" and "K." She talked about using language as a tool, about flirting with the lyrics.
03/wsj_0381:And Michelle, must you continue to smoke two packs of cigarettes a day? 
03/wsj_0381:"It was a process of discovery," said Ms. Stevens, who admitted she sometimes felt a bit like Henry Higgins. "What I tried to do was take the sparks of the positive stuff and fan them.
03/wsj_0381:Not brilliantly, because, after all, this was a performer who was collecting paychecks from lounges at Hiltons and Holiday Inns, but creditably and with the air of someone for whom "Ten Cents a Dance" was more than a bit autobiographical. "It was an exercise of blending Michelle's singing with Susie's singing," explained Ms. Stevens. "If `Dangerous Liaisons' had been a musical she would have had to give a different vocal performance because she was a different character in that movie." 
03/wsj_0382:The company said Ravenspurn "A," the first of three unmanned wellhead platforms, started production.
03/wsj_0382:BP said the field had reserves of 635 billion cubic feet and an estimated production life of 20 years.
03/wsj_0383:The industry used 78.8% of its capability last week, compared with 81.6% the previous week and 87.4% a year ago. 
03/wsj_0383:The capability utilization rate is a calculation designed to indicate at what percent of its production capability the industry is operating in a given week. 
03/wsj_0384:As the leading candidate for president of his country in next year's election, Mario Vargas Llosa ought to be in an enviable position.
03/wsj_0384:Published everywhere to universal acclaim, doted on like a movie star in the Hispanic world from Barcelona to Ushuaia, Mr. Vargas Llosa could live comfortably on his royalties and console his political conscience with the thought that Peru is a hopeless mess not of his making and that he already did his best to reform it with his magnificently cinematic novel about the years of military dictatorship of his youth, "Conversation in the Cathedral." 
03/wsj_0384:But, after some hesitation, he is back on the stump and also still writing important novels about Peru. "The Storyteller" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 246 pages, $17.95), splendidly translated by Helen Lane, first appeared in Spanish in 1987 before the Peruvian economy had reached its present state of virtual collapse.
03/wsj_0384:Even still, the very first sentence of this fable that weaves together Peru's most advanced and most primitive cultural strands speaks of "my unfortunate country." The narrator may be talking about the depredations of the Shining Path Maoists among the Indians of the Andes, or he may be referring to the plunging inti, Peru's rubber currency, or the corrupting effect of the cocaine trade.
03/wsj_0384:But he is swiftly drawn into a tangle of memories about a less newsworthy and more exotic part of Peru: its corner of the Amazon jungle. 
03/wsj_0384:He is in Florence to shake himself free of Peru and get some writing done, just as Mr. Vargas Llosa has gone to Paris and now goes frequently to London for the same purpose.
03/wsj_0384:But this narrator happens upon some photographs in a gallery, pictures taken in Peruvian Amazonia of the untamed and nomadic Machiguenga tribe.
03/wsj_0384:And they remind him of his own experiences with that unhappy scattered culture and of his friend at Lima's University of San Marcos, Saul Zuratas.
03/wsj_0384:Saul was a high-strung student of ethnography, a Jew marked doubly as an outsider because of a huge wine-dark birthmark on his face, for which people called him Mascarita, Mask Face.
03/wsj_0384:Saul knew about the Machiguengas from his studies, and through him the narrator became interested in this most recalcitrant and un-Westernizable of all the indigenous peoples who had come under the Spanish yoke.
03/wsj_0384:Saul, meanwhile, came to believe that anthropology, even at its most benign, was as insidious a form of cultural imperialism as the superficially more blatant activities of Christian missionaries.
03/wsj_0384:This is what we know at the end of the opening section of "The Storyteller." The next voice we hear sounds like this: "There was no evil, there was no wind, there was no rain.
03/wsj_0384:For most of the book, there is no direct connection between its urban and its Amazonian modes.
03/wsj_0384:But the contrast between them becomes a living thing through the brilliant contrast of narrative styles that Mr. Vargas Llosa creates.
03/wsj_0384:The storytellers traveled among the bands, reminding them of their identity.
03/wsj_0384:I am trying to give away as little as possible, but this is not really a mystery or some kind of jungle thriller.
03/wsj_0384:It will be read for the brilliant clash of styles of narration and the even more brilliant way that they have been tied together into a large metaphor for literature and its function in society. 
03/wsj_0384:The region's population, currently estimated at some 500 million people, is growing by 3.2% a year -- "faster than any major region has ever experienced over a sustained period," the World Bank noted in a recent review of the region between the great desert and South Africa.
03/wsj_0384:West Germany's Lufthansa has agreed to buy a 10% stake in Austrian Airlines when the Austrian government continues next spring to sell parts of the carrier to the public, an Austrian Airlines spokesman said.
03/wsj_0384:Elsewhere, Singapore Airlines Ltd., following its recently announced tie-up with Delta Air Lines Inc., is now "contemplating an alliance" with one of several European carriers, Chairman J.Y. Pillay said. 
03/wsj_0384:King Fahd of Saudi Arabia dismissed as untrue allegations that his country's relations with Kuwait were marred by the Saudis' execution last month of 16 Kuwaiti Shiites; the Shiites had been convicted for bombings at Mecca.
03/wsj_0384:Israel is ending six weeks of seizing property from Palestinians who refuse to pay income and value-added taxes in the occupied West Bank town of Beit Sahour, despite having failed to break the revolt, security sources said.
03/wsj_0384:Troops and tax collectors have confiscated cars, furniture and goods valued at about $1.5 million from residents of the mainly Christian middle-class town, sparking international protests.
03/wsj_0384:The bank cut off loans to the country in the wake of the June 4 massacre in Beijing.
03/wsj_0384:As Japan formally announced it's joining an international ban on trading ivory, hundreds of angry ivory traders and carvers marched in downtown Hong Kong to protest the ban.
03/wsj_0384:Some of the marchers presented a petition to the U.S. consulate demanding that Washington, which earlier banned the import of ivory, help the endangered industry.
03/wsj_0384:Hong Kong traders have until Jan. 19 to sell off their stockpile of 670 tons of ivory. 
03/wsj_0384:Environmental groups urged Japan to stop importing timber from Malaysia's Sarawak state, where they say loggers are destroying rain forests and trampling on the rights of natives. 
03/wsj_0384:Japan imports about 50% of the logs exported from the state, which is on the island of Borneo.
03/wsj_0384:The call came as the council of the International Tropical Timber Organization opened a nine-day session in the Japanese city of Yokohama.
03/wsj_0384:Dr. Mikhail Kavanagh, an official of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said that "anything that the Japanese can do to influence the trade is going to come straight back in to influence how the forests are managed." He urged Japan to reduce "wasteful use of tropical timbers," such as disposable chopsticks. 
03/wsj_0384:One study group says Japan's consumption of disposable chopsticks has doubled in the past decade, reaching 20.5 billion pairs in 1988. 
03/wsj_0385:Analyses of why currencies do what they do, losing or gaining value against goods or each other, are a favorite pursuit of economists.
03/wsj_0385:Anyone wondering about the subject's importance, however, should ask Nigel Lawson, who resigned last week as Margaret Thatcher's Chancellor of the Exchequer amid political turmoil generated by Britain's drift toward stagflation.
03/wsj_0385:One economic model fashioned out of this concept is predicting a U.S. recession late this year or early next year.
03/wsj_0385:The WDB model in question is a product of an upstart economics shop called Bell Mueller Cannon Inc. (BMC).
03/wsj_0385:Even though critical, it was just the kind of attention they were seeking.
03/wsj_0385:John Mueller, BMC's vice president and chief economist, spent 10 years on the staff of Rep. Jack Kemp, sharpening his political skills and providing analysis to back up the congressman's supply-side arguments.
03/wsj_0385:So even though BMC is only 18 months old, its principals have been part of the national economic debate for years. 
03/wsj_0385:It defined the WDB as not only currency and commercial bank reserves created by the Federal Reserve, but also the sum of dollar reserves held by foreign central banks. "The world dollar base, in fact, is analogous to the world stock of monetary gold under the classical gold standard," wrote Mr. Mueller.
03/wsj_0385:Goldman Sachs snapped back that the WDB is not an accurate predictive tool because dollar reserves in central banks do not dictate how much money there is in the world. "The Bundesbank might be rather surprised to be told that dollar purchases and sales were their only instrument for monetary policy!" observed Goldman Sachs. "Instead, the supply of money in foreign countries can be (and is) expanded and contracted through open-market operations just as is the case in the United States.
03/wsj_0385:Foreign central banks buy or sell government securities to add or drain reserves from the banking system." BMC replied, yes, but in any monetary system there is one "final asset in which all forms of credit are ultimately payable" and today that final asset is the U.S. dollar. 
03/wsj_0385:Its periods of weakness relative to other currencies correlate with rises in prices in the U.S. 
03/wsj_0385:But that cherished notion may have influenced Mr. Lawson to peg the pound too low, causing Britain to import all of Europe's inflationary pressures.
03/wsj_0385:Criticisms of the U.S. Treasury for agreeing to participate in an international effort to drive down the dollar last month are based on that danger. 
03/wsj_0385:The U.S., because of the dollar's world role, also has exported inflation at times.
03/wsj_0385:When other central banks become concerned about a falling dollar and try to support it by buying dollars with their own currencies, it can inflate the supply of their own currencies. 
03/wsj_0385:Because of America's international responsibilities, it is less free to engage in beggar-thy-neighbor tactics, through protectionism or attempts to manipulate currency relationships to its own advantage.
03/wsj_0385:The U.S. Congress and administration need frequent reminders of that responsibility.
03/wsj_0385:They also need reminders that if they shoulder the burden well, the U.S. can exercise enormous power on behalf of a sound world economy, with benefits to all. 
03/wsj_0385:The best test of how well that responsibility is being exercised can be found simply in how much the dollar holds its value relative to goods and services.
03/wsj_0385:Whatever else the BMC model accomplishes, it furthers the discussion of how to achieve world monetary order.
03/wsj_0385:Given the damaging effects of monetary disorders of the past, that is something much to be desired.
03/wsj_0386:In return, the company would reimburse Mr. Sharp in the event of any future sale of control of the company.
03/wsj_0386:The Toronto Stock Exchange limits the number of options a company can issue to employees. 
03/wsj_0386:The incentive plan is subject to approval by a majority of holders of the subordinate voting shares, other than Mr. Sharp and his associates, at a special meeting to be held Dec. 19. 
03/wsj_0386:For the first nine months of the year, net rose 12% to 9.2 million Canadian dollars, or 93 Canadian cents a share, compared with C$8.2 million, or 84 Canadian cents a share.
03/wsj_0387:Crashing into a cornfield, United Airlines' Flight 232 flipped over, and she lost her grip on her son. "I saw for an instant my son's body floating and flying" toward the back of the plane, Ms. Tsao recalled.
03/wsj_0387:But Evan died of smoke inhalation. 
03/wsj_0387:Safety advocates and members of Congress, calling babies "the neglected population," are stepping up a campaign for the mandatory use of infant safety seats on all flights.
03/wsj_0387:But the Federal Aviation Administration is reluctant to require separate seats for babies because of the added cost for traveling parents. 
03/wsj_0387:Some FAA officials note that few infants have been killed in plane crashes, raising the question of whether safety seats really are needed.
03/wsj_0387:The National Transportation Safety Board will take a close look at the issue during four days of hearings that begin today on the broader issue of what caused the crash that killed 112 people. 
03/wsj_0387:"Infants', toddlers' and young children's safety should no longer be ignored as if they don't count," Mrs. Tsao wrote to the board in advocating use of the safety seats. 
03/wsj_0387:But it is almost impossible to keep hold of a baby during an air crash, or even in severe turbulence. 
03/wsj_0387:During the Sioux City crash, Lori Michaelson of Cincinnati lost her grip on her baby as the plane lurched and tipped over.
03/wsj_0387:The FAA encourages the use of safety seats, but in the past many parents have run into problems trying to use them, even when the plane was only half-full or they had bought an extra ticket especially for the baby. 
03/wsj_0387:When Vanessa Merton, an associate dean at Pace University School of Law, decided to take her young son to Europe last spring, she called four carriers to ask about their policies on car seats. "The people acted like I was transporting heroin," she says.
03/wsj_0387:One reservation agent told her -- incorrectly -- that the airline barred the use of the seats on flights. 
03/wsj_0387:But on one leg of the trip, she was ordered by a flight attendant to take Sabrina out of the seat and hold her during takeoff and landing -- the most dangerous parts of any flight. 
03/wsj_0387:Airlines say that such mistakes are decreasing in the aftermath of Sioux City, but proponents of the safety devices say they still get complaints from parents. 
03/wsj_0387:"People are told one thing on the phone, another at check in, another at the gate, and another on the plane," says Stephanie Tombrello, executive director of the Los Angeles Area Child Passenger Safety Association, which petitioned the FAA in June for mandatory use of child-safety seats.
03/wsj_0387:The Association of Flight Attendants, the main flight attendants' union, is strongly backing that request. 
03/wsj_0387:As part of such a rule, officials say, parents would probably be required to buy an extra ticket for the baby.
03/wsj_0387:The increased cost of flying would inevitably encourage some families to drive rather than fly, they say.
03/wsj_0387:Commercial airlines have the lowest accident rate of all transportation modes -- much lower than cars, for example. 
03/wsj_0387:But he admits that the agency is in "a very uncomfortable position." He says the agency soon will propose that airlines be prohibited from denying the use of safety seats. (Most airlines don't prohibit their use.) He says the agency also will seek public comment on whether the seats should be required. 
03/wsj_0387:Walter Coleman, vice president of operations for the Air Transport Association, the trade group for the major airlines, describes the call for safety seats as "legitimate" and says the group is studying the issue. 
03/wsj_0387:Others worry that the FAA might write a rule forcing airlines to pick up part of the tab for increased infant safety. 
03/wsj_0387:Generally, airlines say they welcome the use of a government-approved safety seat and will even allow the restraint to take up a regular seat for free if the flight isn't crowded. (Most car seats made in recent years are certified for use on aircraft and are so marked.) But space can only be guaranteed if a ticket is purchased. 
03/wsj_0387:What the industry really wants is some kind of device that would protect babies without taking up an extra seat.
03/wsj_0387:But no one has come up with anything that is safer in a crash than the current practice of bundling babies up and trying to pin them to the floor.
03/wsj_0387:Proponents of safety seats are turning up the heat on the FAA. Yesterday, Rep. James Lightfoot, an Iowa Republican, sent FAA Administrator James Busey a letter signed by 56 House members urging the agency to require infant safety seats.
03/wsj_0388:The company also said its board recently instituted a review of internal policies and procedures, including activities conducted by Mr. Clarkson. 
03/wsj_0388:"None of the activities being reviewed has any adverse effect on the financial condition of the bank or its depositors," First Federal Savings Bank & Trust's president, Leo D. Ottoni, said.
03/wsj_0388:First Federal Savings is a subsidiary of First Federal Bancorp. 
03/wsj_0388:The post of chairman will remain vacant indefinitely, a company spokesman said.
03/wsj_0388:Earlier this month Mr. Ottoni, 64, was named acting president and chief executive of the holding company and the savings bank unit.
03/wsj_0388:Previously he had been senior vice president in charge of the savings bank's trust division. 
03/wsj_0389:The new company, called Stardent Computer Inc., also said it named John William Poduska, former chairman and chief executive of Stellar, to the posts of president and chief executive. 
03/wsj_0389:Allen H. Michels, Ardent's former president and chief executive, was named chairman of the new company.
03/wsj_0390:The projected imports comprise importation to Japan and other nations of vehicles produced at the company's major foreign manufacturing bases. 
03/wsj_0390:Toyota said its import program will specifically entail importing right-hand drive vehicles from its Georgetown, Ky., U.S. plant. "An ultimate target of 40,000 units annually has been set for a still-to-be-named model," Toyota said. 
03/wsj_0390:It added that exports of U.S.-made Camrys to Taiwan will rise to 10,000 a year by 1992 from a 1989 level of 4,000 units. 
03/wsj_0390:Toyota also announced a number of major overseas purchases.
03/wsj_0391:Mitsubishi is a partner in Citicorp Plaza in Los Angeles and Pacwest Center in Portland, Ore., and owns most of the land beneath Tokyo's Marunouchi central business district, often referred to as the Rockefeller Center of Tokyo. 
03/wsj_0391:In 1985, Rockefeller Group sold a mortgage on the core of Rockefeller Center to the public in the form of a real estate investment trust.
03/wsj_0391:Analysts say a sale of Rockefeller Group shares should not affect the trust's value. 
03/wsj_0391:If the trust exercises its option as expected, Mitsubishi will gain only a minority stake in the most prestigious section of the center, which was built during the Great Depression.
03/wsj_0391:Managers of Rockefeller's Cushman & Wakefield Inc., a national real estate brokerage, have reportedly structured a company buy-out plan which was rejected by its parent.
03/wsj_0391:Cushman President Arthur J. Mirante II had no comment on reports of the buy-out effort or the Mitsubishi acquisition.
03/wsj_0391:Cushman's management is made up of top brokers who are considered the firm's major asset and whose cooperation is regarded as vital to its success.
03/wsj_0391:Sources estimate Cushman will have 1989 revenue of more than $275 million. 
03/wsj_0391:Rockefeller Group said in September it would seek investors to purchase as much as 80% of the firm, a holding company for Rockefeller family interests.
03/wsj_0391:Mitsubishi has agreed to acquire 627,000 shares of Rockefeller common stock held by trusts established by John D. Rockefeller in 1934. 
03/wsj_0391:When people "understand the resources of Mitsubishi they'll see it represents an exciting future for the company," said Richard A. Voell, president of Rockefeller Group. 
03/wsj_0391:William G. Bowen, chairman of the committee that oversees the family trusts, said the deal meets the committee's objective of diversification of the family's assets. 
03/wsj_0391:David Rockefeller, chairman of Rockefeller Group, said the company talked with many potential investors in Japan, the United States and Europe.
03/wsj_0391:But Mr. Rockefeller said he has a 20-year association with Mitsubishi from his days as chairman of Chase Manhattan Corp. 
03/wsj_0391:Koyata Hosokawa, executive vice president of Mitsubishi, said the company has spent years studying the U.S. real estate market. 
03/wsj_0391:Sources say Rockefeller Group had distributed a "fact book" to international real estate investors including Mitsui Real Estate Development Co. of Japan and Canada's Olympia & York Developments Ltd. 
03/wsj_0391:Before yesterday's announcement, many observers wondered whether a Japanese buyer would be willing to acquire a piece of such high-profile American real estate.
03/wsj_0392:Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded about $970 million of senior debt of Arkla Inc. in response to the company's increased financial leverage, related primarily to restructuring plans that include taking a $189 million charge. 
03/wsj_0392:Moody's contends the natural gas company's debt has risen principally because of large prepayments to producers to settle take-or-pay claims, and due to aggressive efforts to increase market opportunities through acquisitions, which were partially financed by debt. 
03/wsj_0392:Downgraded by the ratings concern are Arkla's first mortgage bonds to single-A-3 from single-A-2; notes to single-A-3 from single-A-2; debentures to single-A-3 from single-A-2; shelf registration to a preliminary rating of single-A-3 from a preliminary rating of single-A-2; convertible preferred stock to Baa-1 from single-A-3, and the concern's rating for commercial paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1.
03/wsj_0392:Moody's said the rating action takes into account Arkla's plan for an initial public offering of as much as 18% of the common stock of its oil and gas exploration and development subsidiary, proceeds of which will be used to repay debt. 
03/wsj_0393:Pedro Perez, secretary of state for economic affairs, said the National Stock Exchange Commission intends to propose the maximum penalty because of what he called the "decidedly fraudulent" nature of the operations under scrutiny. 
03/wsj_0393:But Carlos Croissier, chairman of the commission, yesterday said that figure is incorrect.
03/wsj_0393:Drexel closed its Spanish unit, DBL Capital Markets Espana S.A., in July after confirming that it had used the names of 400 individuals to buy Repsol shares, which it then resold to institutional clients, circumventing restrictions designed to make shares available to private investors. 
03/wsj_0394:ALLWASTE Inc. declared a 2-for-1 stock split, payable Dec. 1, to stock of record Nov. 15.
03/wsj_0394:The Stafford, Texas-based company will issue one additional share of common stock for each of the 14.8 million shares outstanding. 
03/wsj_0395:The average, which peaked with a gain of more than 23 points, added 6.76 to 2603.48. 
03/wsj_0395:Activity was fairly brisk at the opening as hopes for a recovery from last week's string of five consecutive losses in the industrial average led some investors into the market.
03/wsj_0395:But the pace slowed quickly following the round of arbitrage-related buying, involving the sale of index futures contracts and the purchase of stocks, and stayed sluggish through the rest of the session as prices drifted. "People are sitting on their hands," said Bill Langevin, manager of institutional trading at Morgan Keegan & Co., Memphis, Tenn. 
03/wsj_0395:Traders attributed the lackluster activity in part to anticipation of the first pieces of economic data for October: a monthly survey of corporate purchasing managers, due tomorrow, and the employment report, set for Friday. 
03/wsj_0395:Also, a number of analysts believe stocks could fall to the vicinity of their lows during the market's mid-October sell-off before posting any sustainable gains.
03/wsj_0395:The market has begun a process of "trying to find a floor" after its fall, said William M. LeFevre, a market strategist at Advest Inc., Hartford, Conn.
03/wsj_0395:Chevron gained 7/8 to 67 1/4 in Big Board composite trading of 2.1 million shares amid continued speculation that Pennzoil is building a stake in the company.
03/wsj_0395:USA Today reported that an unknown party -- possibly Pennzoil -- acting on its own or with a partner holds between 3.5% and 4.7% of the company's common shares. 
03/wsj_0395:Other strong performers among blue-chip issues included Procter & Gamble, which went up 2 3/8 to 127 3/4; Aluminum Co. of America, up 1 to 69 1/4, and Primerica, up 3/4 to 28 1/4.
03/wsj_0395:But neither the pilots nor the machinists appear interested, and Mr. Davis is barred from making a new bid under terms of an agreement he made with UAL in September, unless UAL accepts an offer below $300 a share. 
03/wsj_0395:One series of dividend-related trades accounted for most of the volume in Southern Co., the Big Board's most active issue, which closed down 1/8 to 27 1/4 on 5.2 million shares.
03/wsj_0395:Crossland Savings tumbled 1 1/2 to 3 3/4 in the wake of its management's recommendation to suspend dividends, because of concerns that it may not meet capital requirements under new federal regulations.
03/wsj_0395:The proposed criteria would bar Crossland from including its $380 million of preferred stock as so-called "core capital." 
03/wsj_0395:The company had $173.5 million in preferred stock outstanding as of June 30. 
03/wsj_0395:Paramount Communications dropped 1 to 54 3/4 amid rumors that the $3.35 billion sale of its Associates Corp. unit to Ford Motor could be delayed until mid-November.
03/wsj_0395:Nashua jumped 4 1/2 to 33 1/2 despite taking steps to ward off Reiss & Co., a Dutch company that is seeking U.S. antitrust clearance to acquire as much as 25% of its common stock.
03/wsj_0395:Nashua expanded a stock-repurchase program by one million common shares -- about 10.6% of its shares outstanding -- and toughened a takeover defense. 
03/wsj_0395:Its earnings from operations for the third quarter were above the year-ago level, but fell short of analysts' forecasts. 
03/wsj_0395:James Clarkson retired as chairman, president and chief executive officer of the Pontiac, Mich.-based bank holding company, which said it is reviewing certain unspecified actions Mr. Clarkson took while in office. 
03/wsj_0395:Philadelphia Museum of Art: "Perpetual Motif: The Art of Man Ray" -- More than 250 paintings, collages, drawings, photographs, objects and films commemorate the centennial of the artist's birth in Philadelphia.
03/wsj_0395:Nearly one-third of the works by this pioneer of dada and surrealism are lent by French collectors and museums (the artist spent most of his life in Paris).
03/wsj_0395:Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh: "Impressionism: Selections From Five American Museums" -- Eighty-five paintings, pastels and sculptures by artists including Cezanne, van Gogh, Monet, Renoir, Sisley and Cassatt.
03/wsj_0395:The works are drawn from the permanent collections of the Carnegie (4400 Forbes Ave., on view Nov. 4-Dec. 31); the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (2400 Third Avenue South, Jan. 27-March 25); the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (4525 Oak St., Kansas City, Mo., April 21-June 17); the Saint Louis Art Museum (Forest Park, July 14-Sept. 9); and the Toledo Museum of Art (2445 Monroe St., Toledo, Ohio, Sept. 30-Nov. 25, 1990). 
03/wsj_0395:Indianapolis Museum of Art: "Latin and Haitian Folk Art" -- An assortment of santos (hand-carved devotional images), retablos (painted tin votive objects) and colorful voodoo banners (handmade of satin, sequins and beads), brought here from Latin America and Haiti by importer Alden Smith. 1200 West 38th St., Nov. 1-Dec. 3. 
03/wsj_0395:Her current show gathers two dozen of these shamanistic pieces, from tiny to towering. 63 Crosby St. (corner of Spring).
03/wsj_0395:"Voices From a Distant Shoreline": Three West Coast-based choreographers -- Anita Addison, Esther Aviva and Joannie Anderson -- come East with an eclectic evening of dance.
03/wsj_0395:Pieces scheduled include Ms. Anderson's "Ragged Claws," a comic look at T.S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"; three excerpts from Ms. Aviva's "Amor Insurrecto," featuring the work of contemporary Nicaraguan poet Gioconda Belli; and the premiere of a structured group improvisation by Ms. Addison and company.
03/wsj_0395:David Gordon/Pick Up Company: For 2 1/2 years Mr. Gordon has been weaving regionally inspired words, music and movement into a tapestry of Americana, "United States." Now the completed work, five self-contained sections stretching over two evenings, can be seen -- at the State University of New York at Purchase (Theatre B, 914-251-6200), Nov. 3-4.
03/wsj_0395:Those who prefer their American pie in smaller portions can catch a program consisting of just the two newest segments: Philadelphia (Zellerbach Theatre, Annenberg Center, 215-898-6791), Nov. 13; Lawrence, Kan. (Crafton-Preyer Theatre, University of Kansas, 913-864-3982), Nov. 19; St. Louis (Kiel Opera House, 314-968-3770), Dec. 1, 2. 
03/wsj_0395:Metropolitan Opera: June Anderson makes her long-awaited debut as Gilda in a new production of Verdi's "Rigoletto." Luciano Pavarotti, partially recovered from sciatica, sings the fun-loving duke, leaving the jester's cap to Leo Nucci, as the hump-backed fool.
03/wsj_0395:Waverly Consort opens its 25th anniversary season with a fully staged production of "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria" ("The Return of Ulysses to His Homeland"), from the Monteverdi trilogy that also includes "Orfeo" and "L'incoronazione di Poppea." The cast of 13 singers is lead by Paul Rowe (Ulisse), Laura Pudwell (Penelope) and Laurie Monahan (Melanto), with an original-instrument Venetian opera orchestra of 20 instrumentalists.
03/wsj_0396:First, addressing the Oct. 13 market break, this was certainly more of a technical gyration and a local jungle exercise, than an investor reaction to the day's political events in Washington.
03/wsj_0396:Look not to the managers of taxable investment funds as the source of selling late that afternoon, but rather to several of the usual suspects ("investment" banks and institutions) geared up with imperfect trading programs that accelerate market deterioration, once begun.
03/wsj_0396:The catalyst for this decline was, indeed, the breakdown of the United Airlines transaction and its resultant pre-margin call liquidation of various holdings by arbitragers and other traders.
03/wsj_0396:Overextension of credit.
03/wsj_0396:The realization that interest rates will be firm due to excessive demand for credit on the part of the federal government (including off-balance sheet requirements) and leveraged buyout related transactions.
03/wsj_0396:Perception of future deterioration of corporate profits.
03/wsj_0396:A dollar that will slide into year end -- due to international interest-rate differentials and the choreographed trading techniques of certain oil importers -- which does not inspire foreign-investor interest. 
03/wsj_0396:Inflation that will be stable for the time being, despite the rising cost of imported goods, because of rising domestic inventories (housing, divestiture candidates, commodities, etc.) requiring liquidation.
03/wsj_0396:Modest inflation/deflation adding to the attractiveness of bonds. 
03/wsj_0396:Mr. Wanniski can "cheerfully inform" Mr. Bradley and the rest of us of his notions as to the party's end, but his energy and intellect would be better used in focusing on measures that will ensure our long-term success as leaders and capitalists. 
03/wsj_0396:Mr. Wanniski might seem simplistic to some when he blames the Oct. 13 market crashlet on Democratic obstructionism of the president's capital-gains proposal.
03/wsj_0396:The UAL financing reverse shocked the market, but the prospect of capital gains not fulfilling the market's hopes was also an important factor. 
03/wsj_0396:Mr. Wanniski's opportuning of the recent stock drubbing to castigate Sen. Bill Bradley for his opposition to a capital-gains tax cut contains some clever but faulty reasoning.
03/wsj_0396:If Mr. Wanniski's theory is right, that a tax cut increases the value of capital assets held by owners, wouldn't that increase also represent a rather dramatic and totally unjustified inflation of those values?
03/wsj_0396:According to his figures, asset values would be pumped up some $50 billion overnight with the passage of the cut.
03/wsj_0397:The U.S. Export-Import Bank cleared a $25 million loan to a telephone company in Chile for the purchase of satellite telecommunications network equipment from U.S. suppliers. 
03/wsj_0397:The Export-Import Bank said Cia. de Telefonos de Chile is buying equipment and project management services from Scientific-Atlanta Inc., of Norcross, Ga., to extend telephone and data-transmission services between Santiago and other Chilean cities.
03/wsj_0398:Critics of program trading are calling increasingly for regulators to raise the cost of trading stock-index futures. 
03/wsj_0398:The idea: Boost the amount of cash required initially to buy or sell a stock-index futures contract from the relatively low current level of about 7% of the contract's value to as much as 50%, the same amount investors must put up to buy stocks. 
03/wsj_0398:They warn that raising the costs of trading futures could backfire and end up making stocks even more volatile. 
03/wsj_0398:Several big Wall Street securities firms have bowed to pressure and pulled back in recent days from stock-index arbitrage, the form of program trading that many accuse of amplifying, if not actually causing, stock-market volatility. 
03/wsj_0398:In stock-index arbitrage, computer-assisted traders buy and sell large amounts of stock with offsetting trades in stock-index futures, profiting from fleeting price discrepancies between the two markets.
03/wsj_0398:They got a taste of it yesterday morning in full-page ads in major newspapers, including this paper, in which Neuberger & Berman, a big money New York manager, demanded federal regulators "immediately" boost margins on stock-index futures to 50%. 
03/wsj_0398:The term "margin" has slightly different meanings in the stock and futures markets, but they both describe the amount of cash investors must put up to get into the game.
03/wsj_0398:Stock margins are literally down payments made toward the purchase of a stock, and the level is set by the Federal Reserve Board.
03/wsj_0398:Higher margins would price many professional speculators -- whose trades help futures markets function smoothly -- out of business.
03/wsj_0398:"If you drive away the specs, then prices will fall in both futures and stocks," declared the head of one Chicago Mercantile Exchange member firm who asked not to be named, reflecting the highly charged debate over program trading. 
03/wsj_0398:Another consequence of driving out speculators here, traders say, could be to widen the momentary price differences between stocks and stock-index futures that entice index arbitragers in the first place.
03/wsj_0398:"If you decrease the liquidity in the futures market, you increase the discrepancies between stocks and futures," said Christopher Pedersen, director of trading at Twenty-First Securities Corp. 
03/wsj_0398:Opponents of index arbitrage trading don't lose much sleep over the prospect of futures speculators being driven out of the market.
03/wsj_0398:They argue that raising the cost of trading stock-index futures would eventually choke off price-jarring arbitrage trades between stocks and futures and increase the stability of stock prices. 
03/wsj_0398:"You would diminish the impact of stock-index arbitrage enormously if you change the margin requirements for futures," said Richard Cantor, chief investment officer for Neuberger & Berman, which manages $17.5 billion in client funds. 
03/wsj_0398:Mr. Cantor said that it was difficult to quantify the impact of stock index arbitrage on the performance of Neuberger & Berman -- whose tax-exempt accounts are lagging broad market averages so far this year -- or of other institutional investors.
03/wsj_0398:But he echoed the complaints of other money managers in claiming that stock-index arbitrage has tended to "commoditize securities, shifting from a focus on earnings and assets to a trading focus." 
03/wsj_0398:Raising stock-index futures margins sharply could curtail the volume of index arbitrage trading by the handful of Wall Street securities firms that dominate the business.
03/wsj_0398:But these firms, many of whom say they have already quit doing index arbitrage trades for their own accounts, are especially resourceful when it comes to taking advantage of profitable opportunities.
03/wsj_0398:A few firms, while claiming not to trade for their own accounts, are effectively doing just that in the guise of executing customer orders, then quietly splitting the profits with their customers, futures traders say. 
03/wsj_0398:Raising stock-index futures margins sharply wouldn't have much of an effect on S&P 500 futures traders known as locals.
03/wsj_0398:Futures industry officials here -- who fear the program-trading debate might turn into an attack on the futures markets themselves -- raise the specter of foreign competition when they argue against the kinds of changes critics are proposing. 
03/wsj_0398:"If futures margins are raised substantially, some other country will allow lower margins, and that's where the business will go," said Barry Lind, chairman of Lind-Waldock & Co., a futures broker. 
03/wsj_0399:Dillard Department Stores Inc. said that stockholders at a special meeting approved an amendment to increase the authorized shares of its Class A and Class B common stock. 
04/wsj_0400:After a bad start, Treasury bonds were buoyed by a late burst of buying to end modestly higher. 
04/wsj_0400:"The market was pretty dull" for most of the day, said Robert H. Chandross, vice president at Lloyds Bank PLC.
04/wsj_0400:He said some investors were reluctant to plunge into the market ahead of several key economic indicators due this week, especially Friday's potentially market-moving employment report. 
04/wsj_0400:During the first hour of trading yesterday, prices fell as much as 1/4 point, or down about $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.
04/wsj_0400:And the Treasury's $17.6 billion auction of short-term bills, which generated strong buying interest, helped to lift the bond market out of the doldrums. 
04/wsj_0400:He said the change in sentiment also reflected perceptions that the slate of economic statistic due this week will be "conducive to a bond market rally." 
04/wsj_0400:The employment report, which will provide the first official measure of the economy's strength in October, is expected to show smaller gains in the generation of new jobs.
04/wsj_0400:Other key economic indicators due this week include today's release of the September leading indicators index and new-home sales.
04/wsj_0400:Despite yesterday's modest bond market gains, economists say investors are anxious about the Treasury's huge quarterly refunding of government debt, the timing of which depends on Congressional efforts to raise the debt ceiling.
04/wsj_0400:Although the Treasury will announce details of the November refunding tomorrow, it could be delayed if Congress and President Bush fail to increase the Treasury's borrowing capacity.
04/wsj_0400:The New York City issue included $757 million of tax-exempt bonds priced to yield between 6.50% to 7.88%, depending on the maturity.
04/wsj_0400:The $56 million of New York's taxable general obligation bonds were priced to yield between 9.125% to 9.90%. 
04/wsj_0400:Bond dealers said the rates for the long-term tax-exempt New York City bonds were among the highest, as a percentage of Treasury rates, for any New York City issue in recent memory. 
04/wsj_0400:The benchmark 30-year bond ended at 102 7/32 to yield 7.92%, compared with Friday's price of 102 2/32 to yield 7.93%.
04/wsj_0400:The Treasury bills sold yesterday settle today, rather than the standard settlement day of Thursday.
04/wsj_0400:And because of the early settlement, the three-month bills actually have a 93-day maturity, and the six-month bills have an 184-day maturity. 
04/wsj_0400:Because of the early settlement, the Federal Reserve was unable to purchase bills for its system account.
04/wsj_0400:The Treasury also held a hastily scheduled $2 billion sale of 51-cash management bills yesterday. 
04/wsj_0400:Here are details of yesterday's three-month and six-month bill auction: 
04/wsj_0400:Here are details of yesterday's 51-day cash management bill auction: 
04/wsj_0400:The junk bond prices of Western Union Corp. tumbled after the company said it won't proceed with an exchange offer to holders of its reset notes. 
04/wsj_0400:The Upper Saddle River, N.J., communications firm said it is considering alternatives to the restructuring of the senior secured notes because of changes in the high-yield market. 
04/wsj_0400:Although the notes held at a price of 92 to 93 immediately after the reset, they started falling soon afterward. 
04/wsj_0400:The company's 7.90% sinking fund debentures were quoted at a bid price of 14 1/4 and an offered price of 30, while the 10 3/4% subordinated debentures of 1997 were being bid for at 28 and offered at around 34 3/4.
04/wsj_0400:High-yield traders said spreads between the bid and offered prices of Western Union junk bonds have been widening for some time, and in certain cases, bids for Western Union securities are not available. 
04/wsj_0400:Elsewhere, prices of investment-grade and high-risk, high-yield junk bonds ended unchanged. 
04/wsj_0400:The two-part issue consists of $200 million of senior subordinated reset notes maturing in 1997 and $150 million of subordinated floating rate notes also maturing in 1997. 
04/wsj_0400:Portfolio managers said expectations are for the issue to be priced at a discount with a coupon of 13 3/4% and a yield of about 14%.
04/wsj_0400:Proceeds from the note sale will be used to repay a portion of the bank borrowings used by Beatrice to redeem its $526.3 million principal amount of increasing rate debentures in August. 
04/wsj_0400:The senior subordinated debentures maturing in 2004 are targeted to be offered at a yield of between 12 5/8% to 12 3/4%. 
04/wsj_0400:In the derivative market, insurance companies have scaled back their purchases of Remic securities, or real estate mortgage investment conduits, as they assess potential claims from the recent California earthquake and hurricane in the Carolinas.
04/wsj_0400:This could mean diminished issuance of derivative mortgage issues during the next few weeks. 
04/wsj_0400:Insurance companies have been major buyers of prepayment-protected planned amortization classes (PACs) during the past few months.
04/wsj_0400:The PACs appeal to insurance companies and other investors because they have higher yields than topgrade corporate bonds and carry the guarantee of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, quasi-federal agencies. 
04/wsj_0400:In the asset-backed market, Beneficial Corp. offered $248 million of securities backed by home-equity loans, the second large deal in the past week.
04/wsj_0400:Last week, a unit of MNC Financial Corp. offered $268 million of home-equity securities. 
04/wsj_0400:The improved tone in the municipal market, largely an offshoot of the New York City sale's reception, helped municipal futures rebound from early lows, but the spread between the contract and Tbond futures continued to grow more negative. 
04/wsj_0400:December municipal futures ended up 11/32 point to 92-14, having pulled off a morning low of 91-23 as cash municipals rebounded.
04/wsj_0401:In a cross-border transaction, the buyer is in a different region of the globe from the target.
04/wsj_0401:However, the total value declined for deals of $100 million and up. 
04/wsj_0401:He explained, in part, that restructuring to prepare for the Common Market expansion due in 1992 "has become more of a strategic priority, both for companies inside and outside the European Community." 
04/wsj_0402:Rymer Foods Inc. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as 500,000 of its common stock purchase warrants at a price of $4 a warrant. 
04/wsj_0402:A warrant permits a holder to acquire one share of common stock for $17.50 a share.
04/wsj_0402:The warrants expire on Oct. 15, 1992, and may be called by the company at a price of $5.25. 
04/wsj_0403:This time of year leave us in 
04/wsj_0403:I've said in moments of 
04/wsj_0404:Gen-Probe Inc., a biotechnology concern, said it signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Tokyo for about $110 million, or almost double the market price of Gen-Probe's stock. 
04/wsj_0404:Gen-Probe, an industry leader in the field of genetic probes, which is a new technology used in diagnostic tests, last year signed an agreement for Chugai to exclusively market its diagnostic products in Japan for infectious diseases and cancer.
04/wsj_0404:That arrangement apparently has worked well, and Thomas A. Bologna, president and chief executive officer of Gen-Probe, founded in 1983, said the sale of the company means "we will be able to concentrate on running the business rather than always looking for sources of financing." Chugai agreed to pay $6.25 a share for Gen-Probe's 17.6 million common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. 
04/wsj_0404:Because the U.S. leads in most areas of biotechnology -- largely because of research investment by the U.S. government -- the sale is sure to increase concerns that Japanese companies will buy American know-how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition. 
04/wsj_0404:"The biotechnology firms may be setting up their own competitors," said Richard Godown, president of the Industrial Biotechnology Association.
04/wsj_0404:During the past five years, Japanese concerns have invested in several of the U.S.'s 431 independent biotechnology companies.
04/wsj_0404:Chugai has been one of the most active Japanese players in U.S. biotechnology companies; it has an equity investment in Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass., and a joint-venture agreement with Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Mich. 
04/wsj_0404:The Japanese government, Mr. Godown said, has stated that it wants 10% to 11% of its gross national product to come from biotechnology products. "It is becoming more of a horse race every day between the U.S. and Japan," he said, adding that some fear that as with the semiconductor, electronics, and automobile industries, Japanese companies will use U.S.-developed technology to gain trade advantages. 
04/wsj_0404:Mr. Bologna said the sale would allow Gen-Probe to speed up the development of new technology, and to more quickly apply existing technology to an array of diagnostic products the company wants to offer. 
04/wsj_0404:By 1988, when only 10 genetic probe-based tests of diagnostic infectious diseases of humans had been approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration, eight of them had been developed and sold by Gen-Probe. 
04/wsj_0404:Osamu Nagayama, deputy president of Chugai, which spends about 15% of its sales on research and development, was unable to pinpoint how much money Chugai would pump into Gen-Probe. "We think Gen-Probe has technology important to people's health," he said, adding: "We think it is important for us to have such technology." He and Mr. Bologna emphasized that both companies would gain technological knowledge through the sale of Gen-Probe, which will expand "significantly" as a result of the acquisition. 
04/wsj_0404:In 1988, Chugai had net income of $60 million on revenue of $991 million.
04/wsj_0404:GenProbe had a net loss of $9.5 million on revenue of $5.8 million.
04/wsj_0404:Recently, Gen-Probe received a broad U.S. patent for a technology that helps detect, identify and quantify non-viral organisms through the targeting of a form of genetic material called ribosomal RNA. 
04/wsj_0404:Among other things, Mr. Bologna said that the sale will facilitate Gen-Probe's marketing of a diagnostic test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. 
04/wsj_0405:A half-dozen Soviet space officials, in Tokyo in July for an exhibit, stopped by to see their counterparts at the National Space Development Agency of Japan.
04/wsj_0405:Wouldn't the Japanese like a piece of it?
04/wsj_0405:That Moscow, with its dilapidated economic machine, would try to sell high technology to Japan, one of the world's high-tech leaders, sounds like a coals-to-Newcastle notion.
04/wsj_0405:But "the Soviet Union has areas where it isn't behind Japan," says Mikhail Shapovalov of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. "We have obtained through the development of Cosmos {the Soviet space program} technologies you don't see anywhere else." 
04/wsj_0405:Japan-U.S. trade relations are bumpy these days, and some Japanese favor decreasing their reliance on U.S. technology in light of the FSX fighter-plane flap, when U.S. officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial fighter-plane technology. 
04/wsj_0405:And, despite its image as a technology superpower, Japan has a lot of weaknesses.
04/wsj_0405:One question being debated in the Soviet Union is how to use the defense sector's research-and-production expertise in the rest of the economy.
04/wsj_0405:The Soviets also hope to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science, which has helped them win twice as many Nobel science prizes as the Japanese. 
04/wsj_0405:By contrast, the Japanese have proved adept at making use of Soviet inventions.
04/wsj_0405:Soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad don't appear to worry the U.S., Japan's principal ally. "We have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the Soviet Union," says a State Department official. "Frankly, I wouldn't expect the Japanese to get hooked on anybody's technology, least of all the Soviets." 
04/wsj_0405:They believe technology is one of their best bets, and some Soviet officials say Moscow will even consider declassifying military know-how if the price is right.
04/wsj_0405:In August, representatives of Keidanren, Japan's largest business organization, visited Moscow to explore exports and investments that would help the Soviet economy.
04/wsj_0405:Out of the blue, the Soviet Chamber of Commerce handed over details on 59 technologies that the Japanese might want to buy.
04/wsj_0405:But, while the Soviets can't expect direct technology flow from Japan, they also hope to benefit from Japanese manufacturing expertise. "The Soviet Union has a lot of know-how, but it has been difficult to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy," says Mr. Shapovalov, the Foreign Ministry official.
04/wsj_0405:Still stinging from the international backlash over the sale two years ago of sensitive military technology to the Soviets by a subsidiary of Japan's Toshiba Corp., many Japanese are eager to avoid appearing to help the Soviets in any way.
04/wsj_0405:Another hurdle concerns Japan's attempts to persuade the Soviet Union to relinquish its post-World War II control of four islands north of Japan. 
04/wsj_0405:And what they have shown isn't impressive. "My impression is that there isn't anything which arouses our interest at first glance," says an official from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
04/wsj_0406:(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 
04/wsj_0406:MAY 1, 1975, SIGNALED A DISTRESSFUL May Day for securities houses, which were forced to end 183 years of charging fixed commissions.
04/wsj_0406:It took effect after seven years of bitter debate between the Securities and Exchange Commission and traders and exchanges.
04/wsj_0406:Within three weeks of the 1975 end to fixed rates there were all-out price wars among brokers fighting for institutional business, with rate slashes of 35% to 60% below pre-May 1 levels.
04/wsj_0406:Ray Garrett Jr., SEC chairman, said the "breadth and depth of the discounting is more than I expected." Even a federal measure in June allowing houses to add research fees to their commissions didn't stop it. 
04/wsj_0406:The change prompted the rise of discount brokers and a reduction in securities research firms.
04/wsj_0406:But there are currently more exchange members than in 1975, with the bigger houses gaining a larger share of total commissions.
04/wsj_0406:Commissions, however, account for a smaller share of investment-house business as takeover advisory fees have soared. 
04/wsj_0407:President Bush said that three members of his cabinet will lead a presidential mission to Poland to gauge how the U.S. can help the new non-Communist government's economic changes. 
04/wsj_0407:Mr. Bush announced several weeks ago that he intended to send such a mission, composed of top government aides and business and labor leaders.
04/wsj_0407:Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, also will be a member. 
04/wsj_0407:In addition, the White House said that Charles Harper, chairman of ConAgra Inc., and John McGillicuddy, chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., will be among a group of at least 15 business and labor representatives in the presidential mission.
04/wsj_0408:Warner Communications Inc. is close to an agreement to back a new recorded music and music publishing company in partnership with Irving Azoff, who resigned in September as head of MCA Inc. 's MCA Records unit. 
04/wsj_0408:Like Mr. Geffen's arrangement, the venture gives Mr. Azoff a link to the world's largest and most successful record distributor; in the U.S. alone, Warner has a 40% share of the market, about double its nearest competitor, Sony Corp. 's CBS Records.
04/wsj_0408:For Warner, meanwhile, it gives the company a second young partner with a finger on the pulse of the hottest trends in the music business. 
04/wsj_0408:But Mr. Azoff had been negotiating for more than a year to get out of his MCA contract, which expired in 1991.
04/wsj_0408:Mr. Azoff reportedly was bored and frequently clashed with top MCA management over a number of issues such as compensation and business plans. 
04/wsj_0408:In an interview at the time of his resignation from MCA, he said: "I'd rather build a company than run one." 
04/wsj_0409:Part of a Series} 
04/wsj_0409:Mr. Panelli has plenty of company.
04/wsj_0409:Nearly three-fourths of the people who own home exercise equipment don't use it as much as they planned, according to The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of Buying" survey.
04/wsj_0409:The Roper Organization, which conducted the survey, said almost half of the exercise equipment owners found it duller than they expected. 
04/wsj_0409:Half of those surveyed said they simply walk these days for exercise. 
04/wsj_0409:That's good news for marketers of walking shoes.
04/wsj_0409:The survey's findings certainly aren't encouraging for marketers of health-club memberships, tennis rackets and home exercise equipment, but people's good intentions, if not their actions, are keeping sales of some fitness products healthy. 
04/wsj_0409:For instance, sales of treadmills, exercise bikes, stair climbers and the like are expected to rise 8% to about $1.52 billion this year, according to the National Sporting Goods Association, which sees the home market as one of the hottest growth areas for the 1990s. 
04/wsj_0409:But even that group knows some people don't use their machines as much as they should. "The first excuse is they don't have enough time," says research director Thomas Doyle. "The second is they don't have enough discipline." With more than 15 million exercise bikes sold in the past five years, he adds, "a lot of garages, basements and attics must be populated with them." 
04/wsj_0409:Still, the average price of such bikes rose last year to $145.
04/wsj_0409:Mr. Doyle predicts a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold at higher prices.
04/wsj_0409:Nancy Igdaloff, who works in corporate payments at Bank of America in San Francisco, may be a good prospect for such a gizmo.
04/wsj_0409:A surprising 78% of people said they exercise regularly, up from 73% in 1981.
04/wsj_0409:This conjures up images of a nation full of trim, muscular folks, and suggests couch potatoes are out of season.
04/wsj_0409:Of course, that isn't really the case.
04/wsj_0409:While she applauds the fact that more Americans are getting up from the television to stroll or garden, she says the percentage of Americans who do "real exercise to build the heart" is only 10% to 20%.
04/wsj_0409:So many people fudge on answers about exercise, the president's council now uses specific criteria to determine what is considered vigorous: It must produce contractions of large muscle groups, must achieve 60% of maximum aerobic capacity and must be done three or more times a week for a minimum of 20 minutes. 
04/wsj_0409:One of the council's goals, set in 1980, was to see more than 60% of adults under 65 years of age getting vigorous exercise by 1990.
04/wsj_0409:Of 14 activities, the Journal survey found that 12 -- including bicycling, skiing and swimming -- are being done by fewer Americans today than eight years ago.
04/wsj_0409:Time pressures and the ebb of the fitness fad are cited as reasons for the decline. 
04/wsj_0409:Jeanette Traverso, a California lawyer, gave up running three times a week to play a weekly round of golf, finding it more social and serene.
04/wsj_0409:Only about a quarter of the respondents said they exercise to lose weight.
04/wsj_0409:But fully 90% of those polled felt they didn't need to belong to a health club. "They're too crowded, and everybody's showing off," says Joel Bryant, a 22-year-old student from Pasadena, Calif. "The guys are being macho, and the girls are walking around in little things.
04/wsj_0409:Nearly half of those who joined health clubs said they didn't use their membership as often as they planned.
04/wsj_0409:Even so, the Association of Quality Clubs, a health-club trade group in Boston, says membership revenues will rise about 5% this year from last year's $5 billion.
04/wsj_0409:There are die-hard bodies, of course.
04/wsj_0409:The proprietor of Sante West, an aerobics studio in San Francisco's Marina district, which was hit hard by the earthquake, says, "People were going nuts the minute we opened," three days after the quake. "The emotional aspect is so draining, they needed a good workout." 
04/wsj_0409:The survey reported the number of people who said they bowl regularly has fallen to just 8% from 17% in 1981.
04/wsj_0409:The American Bowling Congress claims a higher percentage of the public bowls regularly, but concedes its membership has declined this decade. 
04/wsj_0409:To find out why, the group recently commissioned a study of the past 20 years of bowling-related research.
04/wsj_0409:He hit the lanes three years ago on the advice of his doctor. 
04/wsj_0411:Concerning your Sept. 29 article "Retailers Face Cutbacks, Uncertain Future": The outcome of our leveraged buyout is looking very positive.

04/wsj_0411:Your were on target regarding industry problems, but wide of the mark in portraying the financial health of this company. 
04/wsj_0412:The flat report followed a four-month string of declines.
04/wsj_0412:The down trend was partly the result of tighter credit sparked by a discount rate increase by the Bank of Japan in May. 
04/wsj_0412:The central bank also unexpectedly raised the base rate by half a percentage point to 3.75% Oct. 11 as part of an inflation-fighting move that indirectly increases interest rates charged on new home construction loans. 
04/wsj_0413:They claim to have busted spirits, poltergeists and other spooks in hundreds of houses around the country.
04/wsj_0413:If psychics don't work, but your house still seems haunted, you can call any one of a swelling band of skeptics such as Richard Busch.
04/wsj_0413:A professional magician and musician, he heads the Pittsburgh branch of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal.
04/wsj_0413:Tales of haunts and horrors are proliferating beyond the nation's Elm Streets and Amityvilles. "I get calls nearly every day from people who have ghosts in their house," says Raymond Hyman, a skeptical psychology professor at the University of Oregon. 
04/wsj_0413:In a public opinion poll published in the October issue of Parents Magazine, a third of those queried said they believe that ghosts or spirits make themselves known to people. "The movies, the books, the tabloids -- even Nancy Reagan is boosting this stuff," says Paul Kurtz, a philosophy professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, who heads the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal.
04/wsj_0413:The spirits, of course, could hardly care less whether people do or don't believe in them.
04/wsj_0413:For the spooks it's just another day of ectoplasmic business as usual, ghostbusters say; the holiday seems to occasion no unusual number of ghost reports. 
04/wsj_0413:One of the busiest ghostbusters is Robert Baker, a 68-year-old semi-retired University of Kentucky psychology professor whose bushy gray eyebrows arch at the mere mention of a ghost.
04/wsj_0413:Mr. Baker heads the Kentucky Association of Science Educators and Skeptics.
04/wsj_0413:Like Hollywood's Ghostbusters, Kentucky's stand ready to roll when haunts get out of hand.
04/wsj_0413:On a recent afternoon, Mr. Baker and a reporter go ghost-busting, visiting Kathleen Stinnett, a Lexington woman who has phoned the University of Kentucky to report mysterious happenings in her house.
04/wsj_0413:Of the self-starting vacuum cleaner, he says: "Could be Cuddles, {Mrs.
04/wsj_0413:For especially stubborn haunts, Mr. Baker carries a secret weapon, a vial of cornstarch. "I tell people it's the groundup bones of saints," he says. "I sprinkle a little around and tell the demons to leave.
04/wsj_0413:Oregon's Mr. Hyman has investigated claims of flying cats, apparitions and bouncing chandeliers and has come up with a plausible explanation, he says, for every one. "Invariably," he says, "eyewitnesses are untrustworthy." 
04/wsj_0413:The owner, who begs anonymity, asserts that the dwarf, appearing as a dark shadow, has manhandled her, tossing her around the living room and yanking out a hank of hair.
04/wsj_0414:Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. counts under 39,000 workers, down 100 from the start of the year and off 8,500 from after its merger and the market collapse two years ago.
04/wsj_0414:Another major firm has cut 6,000 workers, 13% of its staff, since Black Monday.
04/wsj_0414:The Bureau of Labor Statistics says securities firms in New York City alone have slashed 17,000 jobs from the December 1987 peak of 163,000.
04/wsj_0414:Average annual earnings of those who have hung on, though, surged to $78,625 last year from $69,553 in 1987. 
04/wsj_0414:Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc. this year adds 70 people -- 60 of them in retail -- to its 1,300-member staff.
04/wsj_0414:"I don't foresee any shortages over the next few months," says Ken Allen, an official of Operating Engineers Local 3 in San Francisco.
04/wsj_0414:The supply of experienced civil engineers, though, is tighter.
04/wsj_0414:But, with the state offering only $39,000 a year and California's high standard of living, "there aren't too many to choose from," says Brent Scott, a recruiting officer.
04/wsj_0414:Employee-benefit specialists drew a collective sigh of relief in early October when the Labor Department backed away from a proposal that companies let former employees and beneficiaries -- along with active workers -- borrow against balances in 401(k) and similar savings plans.
04/wsj_0414:Now comes word that IRS regulations being drafted could put companies in violation of the tax code if they make loans to retiree shareholders and directors but don't make them available to other former workers who usually earned less.
04/wsj_0414:The IRS says the question won't be settled until the regulations are issued "shortly." But violation could bring substantial tax penalties to both employer and employees. "It's a severe case of regulatory whiplash," complains Henry Saveth of consultant A. Foster Higgins & Co. 
04/wsj_0414:Frederick Rumack of Buck Consultants has asked Labor to recraft its rule to remove the IRS threat. 
04/wsj_0414:Outplacement consultant Right Associates says the average pay of its clients fell to $66,743 last year from $70,765 in 1987; severance pay dropped to 25 weeks from 29.
04/wsj_0414:Both reflect the dismissal of lower-level and shorter-tenure executives. 
04/wsj_0414:But three out of four managers can't accurately state the value of their own packages, consultant Noble Lowndes says. 
04/wsj_0414:MEA CULPA. Fully 62% of the doctors surveyed for Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. think their fellow physicians are responsible for rising health-care costs, ahead of hospitals (55%) and patients (48%).

04/wsj_0414:Our copy of Racine (Wis.) Labor comes through the mail wrapped around two sections of Baseball Card News. 
04/wsj_0415:The candidates have been crisscrossing this huge country of 145 million people, holding rallies and televised debates in hope of being elected to what must be one of the world's most thankless political jobs: trying to drag Brazil out of its economic and social mess. 
04/wsj_0415:A half-dozen candidates, backing policies ranging from Thatcherism to watered-down Marxism, are given a chance of winning. "Whoever says he knows which of the six will win is out of his mind," says Antonio Britto, a centrist member of Parliament. 
04/wsj_0415:The favorite remains Fernando Collor de Mello, a 40-year-old former governor of the state of Alagoas.
04/wsj_0415:He came out of nowhere to grab the lead in opinion polls, probably less because of his vague program to "build a new Brazil" than because of his good looks, the open backing of the powerful Rede Globo television network and his reputation as a hunter of "maharajahs," or overpaid and underworked civil servants. 
04/wsj_0415:But after building up a commanding lead, the moderate to conservative Mr. Collor has slipped to about 30% in the polls from a high of about 43% only a few weeks ago.
04/wsj_0415:To avoid a runoff, one candidate would have to win 50% of the vote -- a feat that most analysts consider impossible with so many candidates running. 
04/wsj_0415:Two left-wing politicians, Socialist Leonel Brizola, a former governor of Rio de Janeiro state, and Marxist-leaning Luis Inacio da Silva, currently are running neck and neck at about 15%, and three other candidates are given a chance of reaching the Dec. 17 runoff election between the two biggest vote-getters: Social Democrat Mario Covas and two conservatives, Paulo Salim Maluf, a former governor of the state of Sao Paulo, and Guilherme Afif Domingos. 
04/wsj_0415:The dollar, the best indicator of the country's mood, has skyrocketed on the parallel market, as has gold.
04/wsj_0415:The unpopular Mr. Sarney, whose task was to bring about a smooth transition to democracy after 21 years of military rule, isn't seeking re-election. 
04/wsj_0415:What comes out of the ballot box could be crucial in determining whether Brazil finally lives up to the potential of the world's eighth largest economy or keeps living up to its other, less enviable title: that of the developing world's largest debtor, teetering on the brink of hyperinflation, mired in deficits and stagnation, with huge economic inequalities and social discontent boiling under the surface. 
04/wsj_0415:"Depending on the president, we could either be a trillion-dollar economy by the end of the century or stay where we are," says political scientist Amaury de Souza. "And where we are is bad." 
04/wsj_0415:That might have been considered hyperinflation not long ago, but Argentina endured price increases of almost 200% in July before bringing the rate down sharply in August and September. 
04/wsj_0415:Still, massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of 2% to 3% a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper.
04/wsj_0415:About $70 billion is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market, which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government. 
04/wsj_0415:By some estimates, Brazil's internal debt, or combined public deficit, could reach 6.5% of its $351 billion gross domestic product. 
04/wsj_0415:Much of the money goes into subsidies or keeping inefficient state-controlled companies operating.
04/wsj_0415:Among the results is a frequent breakdown of public services.
04/wsj_0415:Economists, businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced state spending; focusing spending on vital areas such as education, health and welfare; turning state companies private; reforming the tax system, raising public service rates to match costs; and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado. 
04/wsj_0415:About 80% of Brazil's voters are believed to live near the poverty level. 
04/wsj_0415:Of the three candidates with a serious chance of winning, Mr. Collor comes closest to advocating the sort of measures that economists say are necessary.
04/wsj_0416:The question is at the root of a brawl between Humana Inc., the big for-profit hospital and insurance company, and its not-for-profit brethren in its home state of Kentucky. 
04/wsj_0416:The battle focuses on the state's certificate-of-need law, which regulates investment in new medical technology.
04/wsj_0416:The law has prevented $216 million of unnecessary expenditures since 1986, according to William S. Conn, president of the Kentucky Hospital Association. 
04/wsj_0416:Meanwhile, another hospital's proposal for a new-generation lithotripter is pending before the board that administers the certificate-of-need law.
04/wsj_0416:Humana, which wants to acquire one of the new machines itself, is on the record as opposed to the proposal. 
04/wsj_0416:HEALTH-CARE experts have long worried that young doctors emerging from medical school with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high-paying specialties instead of primary care, where more physicians are needed most. 
04/wsj_0416:Now there's a new wrinkle in what young doctors want: More than half of 300 residents responding to recent survey said they'd prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee-for-service compensation in their first professional position.
04/wsj_0416:"Ten years ago, a physician would go to a town and take out a loan (to start a practice)," says James Merritt, president of Merritt, Hawkins & Associates, an Irvine, Calif., physician recruiter that conducted the survey. "They won't do that very often today at all.
04/wsj_0416:The numbers behind such fears: The average debt of medical school graduates who borrowed to pay for their education jumped 10% to $42,374 this year from $38,489 in 1988, says the Association of American Medical Colleges.
04/wsj_0416:It reflects values of a generation that wants more time for families and personal interests, says John H. Moxley III, who directs physician-executive searches for Korn/Ferry International. "This is a change in the social fabric of medicine," he says. 
04/wsj_0416:WHEN Catherine Bobar spent several weeks at the Medical Center of Vermont recently with a bone infection in her toe, she shared a room just like most patients. 
04/wsj_0416:The 12-bed "cooperative care" unit is one of about 18 nationwide where a family member or friend helps care for a patient in the hospital. "The philosophy is to make the patient and the family very responsible for a portion of their own care," says Anthony J. Grieco, medical director of cooperative care at New York University Medical Center, where the concept began 10 years ago. "It helps us, and them, while they're here, and it certainly makes them a better health-care team when they get home." 
04/wsj_0416:The approach has generated so much interest that NYU is host to the first conference on cooperative care Nov. 30. "It's really part of the hospital of the 21st century," Dr. Grieco says. 
04/wsj_0416:THE CHIEF NURSING officer can be responsible for more than 1,000 employees and at least one-third of a hospital's budget; a head nurse typically oversees up to 80 employees and $8 million.
04/wsj_0417:A group of Michigan investors has offered to buy Knight-Ridder Inc. 's ailing Detroit Free Press for $68 million but has left unclear how the offer will be financed. 
04/wsj_0417:Indeed, some individuals identified with the group said they haven't committed any money to the bid and weren't aware of it until they heard about it in local news accounts over the weekend. 
04/wsj_0419:The partnership said it is proposing the change largely because the provisions of its senior notes restrict it from making distributions on its units outstanding. 
04/wsj_0419:Under the plan, NRM said holders of its common units will receive one share of new common stock in Edisto Resources Corp. for every 14.97 common units owned.
04/wsj_0419:Holders of NRM's $2 cumulative convertible acquisition preferred units will receive one new common share in Edisto for every 1.342 units they own. 
04/wsj_0419:After the transaction, current common unitholders will own about 21.3% of Edisto, current acquisition preferred holders will own 72.3%, and current stockholders of Edisto will own about 6.4%, about the same stake as Edisto owns now in NRM. Edisto currently is the general partner of NRM. 
04/wsj_0419:As the largest holder of acquisition preferred units, Mesa Limited Partnership would own about 28% of Edisto after the transaction.
04/wsj_0419:As part of the transaction, Edisto agreed to give Mesa, an Amarillo, Texas, oil and gas partnership managed by T. Boone Pickens Jr., a seat on its board. 
04/wsj_0419:NRM said its $2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred units will be converted into an equal number of shares of $2.60 senior cumulative convertible preferred stock of Edisto. 
04/wsj_0419:The transaction is subject to approval of NRM unitholders of record on Oct. 23, among other conditions.
04/wsj_0420:Sherwin-Williams Co. and Whittaker Corp. said they've discontinued talks toward a definitive agreement regarding Sherwin-Williams' acquisition of Whittaker's chemical coating group.
04/wsj_0421:USG Corp. agreed to sell its headquarters building here to Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. of Toronto, and will lease the 19-story facility until it moves to a new quarters in 1992. 
04/wsj_0421:The building-materials concern didn't disclose terms of the sale, which will close in the first quarter of next year. 
04/wsj_0421:Proceeds from the planned sale of the 250,000-square-foot building "will help reduce the debt incurred as a result of our July 1988 recapitalization," said a USG official. 
04/wsj_0422:After hitting two-year highs this summer, net sales of stock funds slowed in September, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group.
04/wsj_0422:Net sales of stock funds in September totaled $839.4 million, down from $1.1 billion in August, the institute said.
04/wsj_0422:Most of the those who left stock funds simply switched into money market funds.
04/wsj_0422:Net sales of bond funds for the month totaled $1.1 billion, down two-thirds from $3.1 billion in August.
04/wsj_0422:Overall, net sales of all mutual funds, excluding money market funds, fell to $1.9 billion in September from $4.2 billion in August, the trade group said. "Small net inflows into stock and bond funds were offset by slight declines in the value of mutual fund stock and bond portfolios" stemming from falling prices, said Jacob Dreyer, the institute's chief economist. 
04/wsj_0422:Many small investors went for the safety of money market funds.
04/wsj_0422:Assets of these and other short-term funds surged more than $5 billion in September, the institute said.
04/wsj_0422:In October, net sales of stock funds at Fidelity dropped sharply, Mr. Hines said.
04/wsj_0422:But he emphasized that new accounts, new sales, inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up this month from September's level. 
04/wsj_0422:He notes that most of the net sales drop stemmed from a three-day period following the Friday the 13th plunge. 
04/wsj_0422:Buoyed by the continued inflows into money funds, assets of all mutual funds swelled to a record $953.8 billion in September, up fractionally from $949.3 billion in August. 
04/wsj_0422:These managers held 9.8% of assets in cash at the end of September, down from 10.2% in August and 10.6% in September 1988.
04/wsj_0422:Managers of junk funds were bolstering their cash hoards after the September cash crunch at Campeau Corp. Junk-portfolio managers raised their cash position to 9.4% of assets in September from 8.3% in August.
04/wsj_0422:"There will be a continuation and possibly greater focus on conservative equity funds, at the expense of growth and aggressive growth funds," says Avi Nachmany, an analyst at Strategic Insight, a New York fund-research concern. 
04/wsj_0423:Secretary of State Baker, we read, decided to kill a speech that Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and a career Soviet expert, was going to give to a student colloquium, the National Collegiate Security Conference.
04/wsj_0423:Or political arrangements "to alleviate the grievances and demands of Soviet ethnic minorities and republics." Why, a Bob Gates might even have said, "Nor are Soviet problems susceptible to rescue from abroad through abundant Western credits." 
04/wsj_0423:Dark hints would be raised that parts of the administration hope Mr. Gorbachev would fail, just as they were when Vice President Quayle voiced similar sentiments.
04/wsj_0423:In fact, he did; the quotes above are from Mr. Baker's speech of two weeks ago. 
04/wsj_0423:But everyone agrees that Mr. Gorbachev's problems result from the failure of his own system.
04/wsj_0423:GATT membership will not matter to Donbas coal miners short of soap, nor will a START treaty make any difference to Ukrainian nationalists. 
04/wsj_0423:Yet much of the political culture seems intent on castigating the Bush administration for not "helping" Mr. Gorbachev.
04/wsj_0423:Its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate, clammy hands in the face of congressional criticism, and fainting spells when someone writes the word "controversy." As one unidentified official clearly in the late stages of the disease told the Times: "Baker just felt that there were some lines in the speech that could be misinterpreted and seized by the press." In short, the problem is not intra-administration disagreement, but preoccupation with the prospect that perestrokia might fail, and its political opponents will ask "Who lost Gorbachev?" 
04/wsj_0423:Mr. Baker may want to avoid criticism from Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, but as Secretary of State his audience is the entire Free World, not just Congress.
04/wsj_0423:We note that in Rome yesterday Defense Secretary Cheney said that European euphoria over Mr. Gorbachev is starting to be tempered by a recognition of "the magnitude of the problems he was trying to deal with." 
04/wsj_0424:Vernon E. Jordan was elected to the board of this transportation services concern.
04/wsj_0424:Mr. Jordan has served as executive director of the United Negro College Fund, director of the Voter Education Project of the Southern Regional Council and attorney-consultant to the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity.
04/wsj_0426:Two gunmen entered a Maryland restaurant, ordered two employees to lie on the floor and shot them in the backs of their heads.
04/wsj_0426:There's just one problem: The law that Sen. Thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the Maryland restaurant murders and almost all other killings.
04/wsj_0426:The Democratic leadership agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue before the end of the year -- a debate certain to focus on the alleged racial inequality of death sentencing.
04/wsj_0426:Even some Democrats concede that there is probably a majority in the Senate that favors some kind of broad capital-punishment measure. 
04/wsj_0426:But in 1976, the court permitted resurrection of such laws, if they meet certain procedural requirements.
04/wsj_0426:But congressional Democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level, with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides. 
04/wsj_0426:The Thurmond bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes, most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the Supreme Court invalidated.
04/wsj_0426:The Thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death, including murder for hire. (Separately, the Senate last week passed a bill permitting execution of terrorists who kill Americans abroad.) 
04/wsj_0426:Amid the swirl of punitive rhetoric surrounding the issue, one critical question involves whether a federal death penalty, on top of existing state laws, would deter any would-be criminals. 
04/wsj_0426:Most of the crimes incorporated in the Thurmond bill are exceedingly rare -- killing a Supreme Court justice, for instance, or deliberately causing a train wreck that results in a death. 
04/wsj_0426:"In that sense, the whole debate is sort of a fraud," argues a Democratic Senate staff member. "It's distracting attention from serious issues, like how to make DEA, FBI and Customs work together" on drug enforcement. 
04/wsj_0426:Republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the Thurmond bill, but they contend that isn't the point. "Many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes," says Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah).
04/wsj_0426:Executions, regardless of how frequently they occur, are also "proper retribution" for heinous crimes, Mr. Hatch argues.
04/wsj_0426:In addition to resuscitating the old issue of whether death sentences deter criminals, this bill has made race a major part of the death-penalty debate.
04/wsj_0426:A large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion.
04/wsj_0426:It would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past.
04/wsj_0426:At least 15 major studies purport to show that particular states have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks, and against black defendants compared with white defendants.
04/wsj_0426:Conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that such research, regardless of its accuracy, isn't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence. 
04/wsj_0426:Lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death-penalty appeals, says Richard Burr, director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund's capital-punishment defense team. 
04/wsj_0426:It might force Congress and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial imbalance -- murders by repeat offenders who torture their victims, perhaps. 
04/wsj_0426:And that, in turn, would only strengthen the argument of those who oppose execution under any circumstances. 
04/wsj_0427:A state judge postponed a decision on a move by holders of Telerate Inc. to block the tender offer of Dow Jones & Co. for the 33% of Telerate it doesn't already own. 
04/wsj_0427:Vice Chancellor Maurice A. Hartnett III of Delaware's Court of Chancery heard arguments for more than two hours here, but he made no comment and asked no questions.
04/wsj_0427:Robert Kornreich, an attorney for the Telerate holders, told Judge Hartnett the Dow Jones offer is "arrogant" and "hostile." He accused Dow Jones of "using unfair means to obtain the stock at an unfair price." 
04/wsj_0427:Michael Rauch, an attorney for Dow Jones, defended the offer as adequate, based on what the company considers realistic projections of Telerate's revenue growth, in the range of 12%.
04/wsj_0428:Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses declined 2.4% to 535,322 units in September from a year earlier, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said. 
04/wsj_0428:With the exception of August, when exports rose 2.1%, exports have declined every month from year-earlier levels since March. 
04/wsj_0429:Lone Star Technologies Inc. said its Lone Star Steel Co. unit sued it in federal court here, seeking to recover an intercompany receivable valued at a minimum of $23 million. 
04/wsj_0429:The lawsuit was filed by Lone Star Steel's unsecured creditors' committee on behalf of Lone Star Steel, which has been operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since June 30. 
04/wsj_0430:Nothing was going to hold up the long-delayed settlement of Britton vs.
04/wsj_0430:On the afternoon of Oct. 17, after hours of haggling with five insurance-claims adjusters over settling a toxic-waste suit, four lawyers had an agreement in hand.
04/wsj_0430:For a while, it looked like the deal -- not to mention the courtroom itself -- was on the verge of collapse. 
04/wsj_0430:At stake was an $80,000 settlement involving who should pay what share of cleanup costs at the site of a former gas station, where underground fuel tanks had leaked and contaminated the soil.
04/wsj_0430:Indeed, the insurance adjusters had already bolted out of the courtroom.
04/wsj_0430:The insurance adjusters think differently. "I didn't know if it was World War III or what," says Melanie Carvain of Morristown, N.J. "Reading the settlement into the record was the last thing on my mind." 
04/wsj_0431:Edison Brothers Stores Inc. said it agreed to buy 229 Foxmoor women's apparel stores from Foxmoor Specialty Stores Corp., a unit of Dylex Ltd. of Toronto.
04/wsj_0432:BROWN-FORMAN Corp. (Louisville, Ky.) -- David R. Jackson, formerly vice president, managing director of corporate communications for Maxwell Communication Inc., was named vice president and assistant to the chairman of this maker of alcoholic beverages and consumer products. 
04/wsj_0434:Indeed, the "art of doctoring" does contribute to better health results and discourages unwarranted malpractice litigation. 
04/wsj_0434:Elaborating on the concern about doctors' sacrificing earnings in order to spend "talk time" with patients, we are finding the quality of the time spent is the key to true rapport.
04/wsj_0434:Even brief conversations can show caring and trust, and need not restrict the efficiency of the communication or restrain the doctor's earnings. 
04/wsj_0434:Right now, the American populace is spending about 12% of our gross national product on health care.
04/wsj_0434:And it is estimated that more than 20% of that, $70 billion, goes to "defensive medicine" -- those measures taken by doctors to protect themselves from the most unlikely possibilities. 
04/wsj_0435:Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said the nation's No. 3 auto maker will need to close one or two of its assembly plants because of the slowdown hitting the industry. 
04/wsj_0435:Chrysler has had to temporarily close the St. Louis and Toledo plants recently because of excess inventories of vehicles built there. 
04/wsj_0435:But Mr. Iacocca's remarks are the most specific indication to date of how many plants could be in jeopardy. 
04/wsj_0435:General Motors Corp. has signaled that as many as five of its U.S. and Canadian plants may not survive the mid-1990s as it struggles to trim its excess vehicle-production capacity. 
04/wsj_0435:The Japanese-managed plants eventually will have the capacity to build some 2.5 million vehicles in the U.S. and that will translate into "market share that is going to have to come out of somebody," he added. 
04/wsj_0436:Revco reacted cautiously, saying the plan would add $260 million of new debt to the highly leveraged company.
04/wsj_0436:It was Revco's huge debt from its $1.3 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 that forced it to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 
04/wsj_0436:Revco insists that the proposal is simply an "expression of interest," because under Chapter 11 Revco has "exclusivity rights" until Feb. 28.
04/wsj_0436:A financial adviser for Revco bondholders, David Schulte, of Chilmark Partners, had mixed reactions to the offer. 
04/wsj_0436:Revco received the offer Oct. 20, but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders.
04/wsj_0436:In addition, Revco's 1,900 stores in 27 states represent a lot of real estate, he said, and demographics are helping pharmacies: The nation's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs. 
04/wsj_0436:Last week, Revco's parent company, Anac Holding Corp., said the company reported a loss of $16.2 million for the fiscal first quarter, compared with a loss of $27.9 million in the year-earlier quarter.
04/wsj_0436:The partnership also includes American Express Co., Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
04/wsj_0436:The offer consists of $410.5 million in cash and the rest in notes.
04/wsj_0436:Acadia would sell up to 10% of the equity in the reorganized company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution, but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares. 
04/wsj_0436:It's not an effort to steal the company" in the middle of the night. 
04/wsj_0437:Declines came because of concern that demand for copper may slow down. 
04/wsj_0437:The December contract was down three cents a pound, settling at $1.1280, which was just above the day's low of $1.1270. 
04/wsj_0437:Futures prices fell during three of five sessions last week, and the losses, individually and cumulatively, were greater than the advances. 
04/wsj_0437:Two of the major factors buoying prices, the prolonged strikes at the Highland Valley mine in Canada and the Cananea mine in Mexico, were finally resolved.
04/wsj_0437:Also, the premiums paid by the U.S. government on a purchase of copper for the U.S. Mint were lower than expected, and acted as a price depressant, analysts said.
04/wsj_0437:At the time merchants were asking for premiums of about five cents a pound. 
04/wsj_0437:All this has led to prolonged selling in futures, mostly on the part of computer-guided funds.
04/wsj_0437:The reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply.
04/wsj_0437:At least one analyst noted that as production improves, the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies. 
04/wsj_0437:"Demand from Japan is expected to continue strong, but not from other areas of the world into the first quarter of next year," he said. 
04/wsj_0437:The Bougainville mine is generally expected to remain closed until at least the end of the year.
04/wsj_0437:It hasn't been operating since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners.
04/wsj_0437:The mines produced a total of 110,000 tons of copper in 1988. 
04/wsj_0437:Mr. Demler said that stocks of copper in U.S. producers' hands at the end of September were down 16,000 metric tons from August to 30,000 tons.
04/wsj_0437:Outside the U.S., he said, producer stocks at the end of August were 273,000 tons, down 3,000 tons from the end of July. 
04/wsj_0437:Consumer stocks of copper in the U.S. fell to 44,000 tons at the end of September from 54,000 tons a month earlier, and stocks of copper held by consumers and merchants outside of the U.S. at the end of July stood at 123,000 tons, down from 125,000 tons in June.
04/wsj_0437:The high point of foreigners' copper stocks this year was 136,000 tons at the end of April, according to Mr. Demler. 
04/wsj_0437:GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: The prices of most corn, soybean and wheat futures contracts dropped slightly as farmers in the Midwest continued to rebuild stockpiles that were depleted by the 1988 drought.
04/wsj_0437:Buying by the Soviets has helped to prop up corn prices in recent weeks, but a lack of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums. 
04/wsj_0437:The December contract ended with a gain of 1.29 cents a pound at 74.35 cents.
04/wsj_0437:According to one analyst, prices opened higher because of reports over the weekend that Brazil and Colombia, at the Pan-American summit meeting in Costa Rica, had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement.
04/wsj_0437:The reports, attributed to the Colombian minister of economic development, said Brazil would give up 500,000 bags of its quota and Colombia 200,000 bags, the analyst said.
04/wsj_0437:The minister was also quoted as saying that a new pact could be achieved during the first half of next year, according to the analyst. 
04/wsj_0438:Louisiana-Pacific Corp. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as five million of its common shares for employee stock plans and other general corporate purposes. 
04/wsj_0439:When the Supreme Soviet passed laws on workers' rights in May 1987 and on self-managing cooperatives a year later, some Western observers assumed Mikhail Gorbachev had launched the Soviet Union on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy.
04/wsj_0439:If Mr. Gorbachev's goal is the creation of a free market, he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future, as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest.
04/wsj_0439:These fears were clearly apparent when, last week, Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert, on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms succeeding. 
04/wsj_0439:Yet the Soviet leader's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power, particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30, do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika.
04/wsj_0439:But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill?
04/wsj_0439:And has he truly persuaded the Communist Party to accept economic change of a kind that will, sooner or later, lead to its demise? 
04/wsj_0439:An alternative and more convincing explanation, confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program, is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market.
04/wsj_0439:For example, while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state, strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market.
04/wsj_0439:But that changed following a resolution from the Supreme Soviet banning cooperatives from operating in some areas of the economy, and permitting activity in others only if the cooperatives are under contract to the state. 
04/wsj_0439:All independent media activity is now illegal, which perhaps is not surprising, but so is the manufacture of perfume, cosmetics, household chemicals and sand candles.
04/wsj_0439:Medical cooperatives, among the most successful in the U.S.S.R., are banned from providing general-practitioner services (their main source of income), carrying out surgery, and treating cancer patients, drug addicts and pregnant women. 
04/wsj_0439:Earlier this month, the Supreme Soviet adopted two more resolutions restricting the freedom of cooperatives: The first enables the soviets to set prices for which goods may be sold; the second bans cooperatives from buying "industrial and food goods" from the state or other cooperatives.
04/wsj_0439:If Mr. Gorbachev is looking toward unleashing the productive forces of the market, these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless. 
04/wsj_0439:Along with some other revealing indicators, these developments suggest that while Mr. Gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls, he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or Chicago schools of economic thought.
04/wsj_0439:Mr. Gorbachev has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods.
04/wsj_0439:He told the Congress of People's Deputies on May 30: "We do not share this approach, since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country." 
04/wsj_0439:Having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons, and the market for fear of the social (political) consequences, Mr. Gorbachev seeks a "third way" that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter.
04/wsj_0439:Most important, this would leave the party intact and its monopoly of political power largely undisturbed.
04/wsj_0439:Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of Italian fascism, whose architects spoke specifically of a "third way": of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism.
04/wsj_0439:The emergence of Russian corporatism had been anticipated in journalist George Urban's introduction to a series of colloquies -- "Can the Soviet System Survive Reform?" -- published this spring. "Communism will reach its final stage of development in a feckless Russo -- corporation-socialist in form, nationalistic in content and Oriental in style -- that will puzzle the world with alternating feats of realism and recklessness. . . ." 
04/wsj_0439:The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an "organic" society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified, and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation.
04/wsj_0439:The key to the creation of the "organic" state lay in the formation of "natural" groups that would undertake the role of decision-making.
04/wsj_0439:The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress.
04/wsj_0439:Instead, he proposed a "law-governed economy," in which there would be a "clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management." The latter would be undertaken by "enterprises, joint stock companies and cooperatives." These would not function independently, but would act together to form "combines, unions and associations" to tackle problems and coordinate their activities. 
04/wsj_0439:To ensure the loyalty of the business sector, Mr. Gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests, probably by restricting competition.
04/wsj_0439:It is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the corporatist model attractive to both the party and labor. 
04/wsj_0439:The work force provides the third arm of the "alliance." Within the alliance it is supposed to act as a balancing force, guarding against excessive control by government or abuse of its economic position by business, for either could result in a deterioration of its living standards (under the new resolutions, workers councils may demand that a cooperative be closed or its prices be reduced).
04/wsj_0439:By providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher, and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods, Mr. Gorbachev hopes to revive the popularity of the party. 
04/wsj_0439:An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R., particularly the Democratic Union, allege that they show "terroristic tendencies" and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims.
04/wsj_0439:It is possible that, in perpetuating such myths, the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism. 
04/wsj_0439:Mr. Gorbachev would appear to see his central task, however, as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor, capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo.
04/wsj_0439:The weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations -- Mr. Gorbachev is a consummate political leader, perhaps one of the greatest -- but in its economic prescription.
04/wsj_0439:Miss Brady is deputy director of the Russian Research Foundation in London. 
04/wsj_0440:New construction contracting climbed 8% in September to an annualized $274.2 billion, with commercial, industrial and public-works contracts providing most of the increase, according to F.W. Dodge Group. 
04/wsj_0440:Through the first nine months of the year, the unadjusted total of all new construction was $199.6 billion, flat compared with a year earlier.
04/wsj_0440:A small decline in total construction for the entire year is possible if contracting for housing doesn't increase in response to this year's lower mortgage rates, said George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist of Dodge, the forecasting division of publisher McGraw-Hill Inc. 
04/wsj_0440:The index uses a base of 100 in 1982. 
04/wsj_0440:"At the end of the third quarter, there was still no evidence of renewed home building in response to the midyear decline of mortgage rates," Mr. Christie said.
04/wsj_0440:Commercial and industrial construction rose sharply, partly because of three large projects, each expected to cost more than $100 million.
04/wsj_0440:Public-works and utility projects, also known as non-building contracting, grew 18% to $52.2 billion in September, but the nine-month total of $36.9 billion was down 3% from a year earlier. 
04/wsj_0440:The Sept. 30 end of the federal fiscal year may have prodded contractors to get any behind-schedule road and bridge construction under way "before the clock ran out," Mr. Christie said, referring to threatened 5% across-the-board budget cuts. 
04/wsj_0441:Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered ratings on long-term debt of CS First Boston Inc., the holding company of Wall Street giant First Boston Corp., because of First Boston's "aggressive merchant banking risk" in highly leveraged takeovers. 
04/wsj_0441:About $550 million of long-term debt is affected, according to Moody's. 
04/wsj_0441:A spokesman for CS First Boston said: "We remain committed to a full range of businesses, including merchant banking.
04/wsj_0441:First Boston's merchant banking risks mounted last month as highly leveraged Campeau Corp., First Boston's most lucrative client of the decade, was hit by a cash squeeze and the high-risk junk bond market tumbled.
04/wsj_0441:First Boston incurred millions of dollars of losses on Campeau securities it owned as well as on special securities it couldn't sell.
04/wsj_0441:Moody's said its rating changes actions "reflect CS First Boston's aggressive merchant banking risk as well as the risk profile of its current merchant banking exposures." It said CS First Boston "has consistently been one of the most aggressive firms in merchant banking" and that "a very significant portion" of the firm's profit in recent years has come from merchant banking-related business. 
04/wsj_0441:"These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston's equity," Moody's said. "Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm's equity." 
04/wsj_0442:Quotron Systems Inc. plans to cut about 400, or 16%, of its 2,500 employees over the next several months. 
04/wsj_0442:"This action will continue to keep operating expenses in line" with revenue, said J. David Hann, president and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Quotron.
04/wsj_0442:The move by the financial information and services subsidiary of Citicorp is a "response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry, which has been contracting" since October 1987's stock market crash, the executive added. 
04/wsj_0442:Independent providers of financial information, including Quotron, have been under some pressure as the major securities houses try to regain their hold on the production of market data and on the related revenue.
04/wsj_0442:Shearson, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. and Salomon Inc. are discussing formation of a group to sell securities-price data. 
04/wsj_0442:The job cuts, to be made in a number of areas at various job levels, are "a streamlining of operations," a spokeswoman said.
04/wsj_0442:The company has no immediate plans to close any operations, she said, but Quotron may subcontract some work that it has been doing in-house, including refurbishment and production of Quotron 1000 equipment used in delivering financial data. 
04/wsj_0442:The spokeswoman said the move isn't directly a response to Quotron's loss of its two biggest customers, Merrill Lynch & Co. and American Express Co. 's Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., to Automated Data Processing Inc. earlier this year. 
04/wsj_0442:The spokeswoman noted that last week, Kidder, Peabody & Co., the securities subsidiary of General Electric Co., chose a Quotron subsidiary to provide order-processing services.
04/wsj_0442:And Oct. 24, Quotron said it will market the automated trading system of broker-dealer Chapdelaine Government Securities Inc. 
04/wsj_0442:Quotron isn't profitable on Citicorp's books because of the interest charges the New York bank holding company incurred in buying the financial-data concern for $680 million, says Ronald I. Mandle, analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
04/wsj_0443:The Oakland Athletics' four-game sweep over the San Francisco Giants in the World Series may widen already-sizable losses that the ABC network will incur on the current, final year of its baseball contract. 
04/wsj_0443:The 1989 Series, disrupted by a devastating earthquake and diminished in national interest because both teams came from the San Francisco Bay area, is likely to end up as the lowest-rated Series of this decade and probably since the event has been broadcast. 
04/wsj_0443:The first three games were seen by an average of only 17% of U.S. homes, a sharp decline from the 23.7% rating for last year's Series.
04/wsj_0443:The network had been expected to have losses of as much as $20 million on baseball this year. 
04/wsj_0443:It isn't clear how much those losses may widen because of the short Series.
04/wsj_0443:But some industry executives said ABC, in anticipation of a four-game sweep, limited its losses by jacking up the number of commercials it aired in the third and fourth games.
04/wsj_0443:ABC's baseball experience may be of interest to CBS Inc., which next season takes over the broadcasting of all baseball playoffs in a four-year television contract priced at $1.06 billion.
04/wsj_0443:Last year's series, broadcast by General Electric Co. 's NBC, was the lowest-rated Series in four years; instead of featuring a major East Coast team against a West Coast team, it pitted the Los Angeles Dodgers against the losing Oakland A's. 
04/wsj_0443:The Series got off to a lukewarm start Oct. 14 with a 16.2% rating; the next night it drew 17.4% of homes.
04/wsj_0443:Then came the earthquake and a damaging delay of 11 days. 
04/wsj_0443:Some people had hoped ABC's ratings would go up because of the intense focus on the event in the aftermath of the earthquake.
04/wsj_0444:Bond prices continued to edge higher in anticipation of more news showing a slower economy.
04/wsj_0444:Kidder Peabody became the most recent firm to swear off stock-index arbitrage trading for its own account, and Merrill Lynch late yesterday took the major step of renouncing the trading strategy even for its clients. 
04/wsj_0444:The Dow industrials shot up 23 points in the opening hour, at least in part because of buy programs generated by stock-index arbitrage, a form of program trading involving futures contracts.
04/wsj_0444:But interest waned as the day wore on and investors looked ahead to the release later this week of two important economic reports. 
04/wsj_0444:The first is Wednesday's survey of purchasing managers, considered a good indicator of how the nation's manufacturing sector fared in October.
04/wsj_0444:The other is Friday's measure of October employment, an indicator of the broader economy's health.
04/wsj_0444:The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained about an eighth of a point, or about $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount.
04/wsj_0444:The British pound, pressured by last week's resignations of key Thatcher administration officials, nevertheless rose Monday to $1.5820 from Friday's $1.5795. 
04/wsj_0445:Why, until last spring, did the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan sometimes take several days to correct typographical errors in its paper work for international transactions? 
04/wsj_0445:Their factories may look like sets for a Spielberg movie, but their offices, with rows of clerks hunched over ledgers and abacuses, are more like scenes from a Dickens novel. 
04/wsj_0445:Overall, PC sales in Japan in the first half of 1989 were 34% higher than in the year-earlier period.
04/wsj_0445:And with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency, more and more Japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice. "We have too many people in our home offices," says Yoshio Hatakeyama, the president of the Japan Management Association. "Productivity in Japanese offices is relatively low." 
04/wsj_0445:With Japanese companies in a wide range of industries -- from heavy industry to securities firms -- increasing their market share world-wide, the prospect of an even more efficient Japanese economic army may rattle foreigners.
04/wsj_0445:After years of talking about selling in Japan, more and more U.S. companies are seriously pouring in.
04/wsj_0445:Ungermann-Bass Inc. has a bigger share of the computer-network market in Japan than at home. 
04/wsj_0445:Typical is one office of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau -- the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry. "Personal Computer" yearbooks are lined up on nearly every desk, and dog-eared copies of Nikkei Computer crowd magazine racks.
04/wsj_0445:While American PC sales have averaged roughly 25% annual growth since 1984 and West European sales a whopping 40%, Japanese sales were flat for most of that time.
04/wsj_0445:Japanese office workers use PCs at half the rate of their European counterparts and one-third that of the Americans. 
04/wsj_0445:The market planning and sales promotion office of Nomura Securities Co., for example, has more than 30 computers for its 60 workers, a respectable ratio.
04/wsj_0445:But the machines aren't on employees' desks; they ring the perimeter of the large office.
04/wsj_0445:In Japan, those functions account for only about a third of the software market.
04/wsj_0445:In the U.S., one-fifth of the office PCs are hooked up to some sort of network.
04/wsj_0445:Some Japanese operations, such as securities-trading rooms, may be ahead of their American counterparts, he says, but "basically, there's little analysis done on computers in Japan." Of course, simply buying computers doesn't always solve problems, and many American companies have erred by purchasing technology they didn't understand.
04/wsj_0445:Because the Japanese "alphabet" is so huge, Japan has no history of typewriter use, and so "keyboard allergy," especially among older workers, remains a common affliction. "I have no experience before with such sophisticated machinery," says Matsuo Toshimitsu, a 66-year-old executive vice president of Japan Air Lines, explaining his reluctance before accepting a terminal in his office this summer. 
04/wsj_0445:Until recently, much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least unaffordable. 
04/wsj_0445:Dozens of small companies did, swiftly establishing a standard operating system.
04/wsj_0445:That spurs competition and growth, allows users to change and mix brands easily, and increases software firms' incentive to write packages because they can be sold to users of virtually any computer. 
04/wsj_0445:If a record industry lacked a common standard, Sony CD owners could listen to a Sony version of Madonna's "Like a Prayer" but not one made for a Panasonic player.
04/wsj_0445:That is the state of Japan's computer industry.
04/wsj_0445:NEC won't release its code, and every one of the dozen or so makers has its own proprietary operating system -- all incompatible with each other.
04/wsj_0445:Most rivals "have a working relationship with NEC, often through cross-licensing of technology," the Japan Personal Computer Software Association noted recently. "They hesitate to market NEC-compatible machines; NEC disapproves of such machines, and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship." 
04/wsj_0445:While tens of thousands of software packages using the IBM standard are available in the U.S., they say only about 8,000 are written for NEC.
04/wsj_0445:A year ago, Japan's Fair Trade Commission warned NEC about possible violations of anti-monopoly laws for discouraging retailers from discounting. 
04/wsj_0445:In Japan, "software is four to five years behind the U.S. because hardware is four to five years behind, because NEC is enjoying a monopoly," complains Kazuhiko Nishi, the president of Ascii Corp., one of Japan's leading PC-magazine publishing and software companies. "There are no price wars, no competition." An NEC spokeswoman responds that prices are higher in Japan because customers put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the U.S.
04/wsj_0445:By increasing the number of PCs it uses from 66 to 1,000, Omron Tateishi Electronics Co., of Kyoto, hopes not only to make certain tasks easier but also to transform the way the company is run. "Managers have long been those who supervise their subordinates so orders would be properly acted on," a spokesman says. "But new managers will have to be creators and innovators . . . and for that purpose it is necessary to create an environment where information from both inside and outside the company can be reached easily, and also shared." 
04/wsj_0445:It has won about 15% of the retail PC market.
04/wsj_0445:Sony Corp., which temporarily dropped out of the PC business three years ago, started selling its work station in 1987 and quickly became the leading Japanese company in that market. 
04/wsj_0445:In a country where elbow room is scarce, laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry's future growth.
04/wsj_0445:Toshiba Corp. busted open that sector this summer with a notebook-sized machine that retails for less than 200,000 yen (under $1,500) -- one of the smallest, cheapest PCs available in the country.
04/wsj_0445:Many of the companies are even dropping their traditional independence and trying to band together to create some sort of standard.
04/wsj_0445:Two years ago, most of the smaller makers joined under the Microsoft Corp. umbrella to adopt a version of the American IBM AT standard.
04/wsj_0445:As with many other goods, the American share of Japan's PC market is far below that in the rest of the world.
04/wsj_0445:And because general retail centers such as ComputerLand have little presence in Japan, sales remain in the iron grip of established computer makers. 
04/wsj_0445:Apple didn't introduce a kanji machine -- one that handles the Chinese characters of written Japanese -- until three years after entering the market.
04/wsj_0445:Apple recently hired its first Japanese president, luring away an official of Toshiba's European operations, as well as a whole Japanese top-management team.
04/wsj_0446:From a reading of the somewhat scant English-language medical literature on RU-486, the French abortion pill emerges as one of the creepiest concoctions around.
04/wsj_0446:This is not only because it kills the unborn, a job at which it actually is not outstandingly efficient, zapping only 50% to 85% of them depending on which study you read (prostaglandin, taken in conjunction with the pill, boosts the rate to 95%).
04/wsj_0446:Abortion via the pill is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion.
04/wsj_0446:It is time-consuming (the abortion part alone lasts three days, and the clinical part comprises a week's worth of visits), bloody (one woman in a Swedish trial required a transfusion, although for most it resembles a menstrual period, with bleeding lasting an average of 10 days), and painful (many women require analgesic shots to ease them through).
04/wsj_0446:Timing is of the essence with RU-486.
04/wsj_0446:It is most effective taken about a week after a woman misses her menstrual period up through the seventh week of pregnancy, when it is markedly less effective.
04/wsj_0446:So far, all the studies have concluded that RU-486 is "safe." But "safe," in the definition of Marie Bass of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, means "there's been no evidence so far of mortality." No one has researched the long-term effects of RU-486 on a woman's health or fertility. 
04/wsj_0446:The drug has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of DES, the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it. 
04/wsj_0446:A risk of birth defects, a sure source of lawsuits, is one reason the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of RU-486. 
04/wsj_0446:RU-486 "probably represents a technical advance in an area where none is needed, or at least not very much," said Phillip Stubblefield, president of the National Abortion Federation, at a reproductive health conference in 1986.
04/wsj_0446:It typically takes from eight to 10 years to obtain the Food and Drug Administration's approval for a new drug, and the cost of testing and marketing a new drug can range from $30 million to $70 million. 
04/wsj_0446:The Health and Human Services Department currently forbids the National Institutes of Health from funding abortion research as part of its $8 million contraceptive program.
04/wsj_0446:But the Population Council, a 37-year-old, $20 million nonprofit organization that has the backing of the Rockefeller and Mellon foundations and currently subsidizes most U.S. research on contraceptives, has recently been paying for U.S. studies of RU-486 on a license from its French developer, Roussel-Uclaf, a joint subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst and the French government. 
04/wsj_0446:A June 1988 article in Mother Jones magazine is typical of the general level of media ignorance. "For a woman whose period is late, using RU-486 means no waiting, no walking past picket lines at abortion clinics, and no feet up in stirrups for surgery," burbles health writer Laura Fraser. "It also means she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant." Wrong on all counts, Miss Fraser. 
04/wsj_0446:RU-486 is being administered in France only under strict supervision in the presence of a doctor. (Roussel reportedly has every pill marked and accounted for to make sure none slips into the black market.) Thus, a woman who used RU-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines; an initial visit for medical screening (anemics and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated) and to take the pill, a second trip 48 hours later for the prostaglandin, administered either via injection or vaginal suppository, and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely aborted. 
04/wsj_0446:No doctor who fears malpractice liability would likely expose a non-pregnant patient to the risk of hemorrhaging.
04/wsj_0446:At seven weeks, an embryo is about three-fourths of an inch long and recognizably human. 
04/wsj_0446:At the behest of pro-choice members of Congress, a four-year reauthorization bill for Title X federal family-planning assistance now contains a $10 million grant for "development, evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices, drugs and methods." If this passes -- a Senate version has already been cleared for a floor vote that is likely early next year -- it would put the federal government into the contraceptive marketing business for the first time.
04/wsj_0446:We do not know whether RU-486 will be as disastrous as some of the earlier fertility-control methods released to unblinking, uncritical cheers from educated people who should have known better. (Remember the Dalkon Shield and the early birth-control pills?) We will not know until a first generation of female guinea pigs -- all of whom will be more than happy to volunteer for the job -- has put the abortion pill through the clinical test of time. 
04/wsj_0446:Mrs. Allen is a senior editor of Insight magazine.
04/wsj_0447:On June 30, a major part of our trade deficit went poof! No figure juggling; no witchcraft; just vastly improved recording of some of our exports. 
04/wsj_0447:The Commerce Department found that U.S. exports in 1988, net of imports, were understated by $20.9 billion a year and understated at the annualized rate of $25.4 billion in the first quarter of 1989.
04/wsj_0447:More than half of the "newly found" net exports were from just a few service-sector categories.
04/wsj_0447:Some of the biggest service-industry exporters -- American financial-service companies, for example -- have yet to be fully included in our export statistics. 
04/wsj_0447:Nearly 10 years ago, representatives of service-sector companies worked out a plan with the Commerce Department to improve the data on service-sector exports.
04/wsj_0447:Both groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports -- such as inbound tourism; legal, accounting and other professional services furnished to foreigners; financial, engineering and construction services; and the like -- were not being counted as exports. 
04/wsj_0447:In the quarterly balance-of-payments report, those merchandise trade figures are merged with statistics on exports and imports of services, as well as returns on investments abroad by Americans and returns on foreign investments in the U.S. 
04/wsj_0447:The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. (net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad), some exports by professional firms (a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine), and improved data from travel and tourism. 
04/wsj_0447:Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas, the value of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $20 billion a year.
04/wsj_0447:That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $75 billion than to $95 billion in 1988, and $55 billion (annualized) rather than $80 billion in the first quarter of 1989. 
04/wsj_0447:These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar.
04/wsj_0447:Too early to tell, but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture.
04/wsj_0447:It does not relieve the need for our market-opening efforts for both goods and services, but it does suggest that it is our exports of services, and not just borrowing, that is financing our imports of goods. 
04/wsj_0447:Mr. Freeman is an executive vice president of American Express. 
04/wsj_0448:The collapse of a $6.79 billion labor-management buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. may not stop some of Wall Street's top talent from collecting up to $53.7 million in fees. 
04/wsj_0448:Under a merger agreement reached Sept. 14, the UAL board agreed to reimburse certain of the buy-out group's expenses out of company funds even if the transaction wasn't completed, provided the group didn't breach the agreement.
04/wsj_0448:But neither the pilots nor the machinists appear interested, and Mr. Davis is barred from making a new bid under terms of an agreement he made with UAL in September unless UAL accepts an offer below $300 a share. 
04/wsj_0449:Kidder, Peabody & Co., a unit of General Electric Co., announced it would stop doing stock-index arbitrage for its own account, and Merrill Lynch & Co. pulled out of the practice altogether. 
04/wsj_0449:At the New York Stock Exchange, which has been buffeted by complaints from angry individual investors and the exchange's own listed companies, Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. held an emergency meeting with senior partners of some of the Big Board's 49 stock specialist firms.
04/wsj_0449:A Big Board spokesman would only say, "We're working the problem and looking at the issue and meeting with a broad number of customers and constituents to get their views and ideas on the issue." The program-trading outcry was taken to a new level when giant Contel Corp. said it and 20 or more of the Big Board's listed companies are forming an unprecedented alliance to complain about the exchange's role in program trading. 
04/wsj_0449:Merrill has been the fourth-biggest stock-index arbitrage trader on the Big Board this year, executing an average of 18.1 million shares a month in such trades, or about one million shares a day. 
04/wsj_0449:Merrill's move is one of the most sweeping program-trading pullbacks of recent days, because the big securities firm will no longer execute stock-index arbitrage trades for customers.
04/wsj_0449:Merrill has been one of the main firms executing index arbitrage for customers.
04/wsj_0449:In stock-index arbitrage, traders buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures and options.
04/wsj_0449:But yesterday, Mr. Carpenter said big institutional investors, which he wouldn't identify, "told us they wouldn't do business with firms" that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts. "We were following the trend of our competitors who were under pressure from institutions," he said. 
04/wsj_0449:Kidder so far this year has executed a monthly average of 37.8 million shares in index-arbitrage trading, and is second only to Morgan Stanley in overall program trading, which includes index arbitrage.
04/wsj_0449:Most of Kidder's program trading is for its own account, according to the New York Stock Exchange. 
04/wsj_0449:But at least one chief executive said he called Mr. Welch to complain about Kidder's aggressive use of program trading, and other market sources said they understood that Mr. Welch received many phone calls complaining about Kidder's reliance on index arbitrage as a major business.
04/wsj_0449:Supporters of index arbitrage haven't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy, as some did during the post-crash outcry of 1987.
04/wsj_0449:But Merrill Lynch, in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage, suggested that the current debate has missed the mark. 
04/wsj_0449:Merrill said it continues to believe that "the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy.
04/wsj_0449:Indeed, there are legitimate hedging strategies used by managers of large portfolios such as pension funds that involve program trading as a means of protecting the assets of their pension beneficiaries." 
04/wsj_0449:Merrill's index arbitragers will continue to do other kinds of computer-assisted program trading, so there probably won't be any layoffs at the firm, people familiar with Merrill's program operation said. 
04/wsj_0449:Mr. Greenberg, noting that stock-index arbitrage rises and ebbs with stock market's volatility, said that for the first four months of the firm's fiscal year beginning in July, stock-index arbitrage had been a "break-even" proposition for Bear Stearns. 
04/wsj_0449:And there was speculation yesterday that Fidelity Investments and other large mutual-fund companies might soon follow the lead of Kemper Corp. and other institutions in cutting off trading business to securities firms that do program trading.
04/wsj_0449:A Fidelity spokesman in Boston denied the speculation, saying the program-trading issue was more of a regulatory problem. 
04/wsj_0449:But a much smaller mutual fund company, the USAA Investment Management Co. unit of USAA, San Antonio, Texas, said it informed nine national brokerage firms it will cease business with them unless they stop index-arbitrage trading.
04/wsj_0449:USAA, with 400,000 mutual fund accounts, manages more than $10 billion, $2 billion of which is in the stock market.
04/wsj_0449:Charles Wohlstetter, chairman of Contel, who is helping organize the alliance of Big Board-listed firms, said he had no time to work yesterday because he received so many phone calls, faxes and letters supporting his view that the Big Board has been turned into a "gambling casino" by program traders. 
04/wsj_0449:"We are reaching the moment of truth" on Wall Street, said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. "{Wall Street} is beginning to realize -- as Shakespeare said -- the trouble is not in our stars, but in ourselves." 
04/wsj_0449:recently ceased index arbitrage for their own accounts, in millions of shares such trading for its own account 
04/wsj_0450:Robert Guy, an associate curator at the Princeton Art Museum, was previewing a June antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix, which he, as a specialist in Attic pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in "IFAR Reports," knew was stolen.
04/wsj_0450:The timing of his visit was fortuitous; the man who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the hall.
04/wsj_0450:To confirm Mr. Guy's identification, Sotheby's and IFAR exchanged photos by fax, and the waiting man, apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen, agreed to release it.
04/wsj_0450:A former curator of the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook, N.Y., pleaded guilty in July to stealing and selling original signed and dated comic strips, among them 29 Dick Tracy strips by Chester Gould, 77 Prince Valiant Sunday cartoons by Hal Foster, and a dozen Walt Disney animation celluloids, according to Barbara Hammond, the museum's director.
04/wsj_0450:The curator, 27-year-old Sherman Krisher of Greenwich, Conn., had worked his way up from janitor in seven years at the museum.
04/wsj_0450:His efforts to get back the stolen strips had resulted in recovery of just three.
04/wsj_0450:Two days earlier, his attorney met in a Park Avenue law office with a cartoon dealer who expected to sell 44 of the most important stolen strips to Mr. Russell for $62,800.
04/wsj_0450:He was sentenced to 500 hours of community service and restitution to the museum of $45,000. 
04/wsj_0450:Authorities at London's Heathrow Airport are investigating the disappearance of a Paul Gauguin watercolor, "Young Tahitian Woman in a Red Pareo," that has two sketches on its verso (opposite) side.
04/wsj_0450:Valued at $1.3 million, it was part of a four-crate shipment.
04/wsj_0450:The air-waybill number was changed en route, and paper work showing that the crates had cleared customs was misplaced, so it was a week before three of the four crates could be located in a bonded warehouse and the Gauguin discovered missing.
04/wsj_0450:Although Heathrow authorities have been watching a group of allegedly crooked baggage handlers for some time, the Gauguin may be "lost." Chief Inspector Peter Seacomb of the Criminal Investigation Department at the airport said, "It is not uncommon for property to be temporarily mislaid or misrouted." 
04/wsj_0450:Officials at the University of Virginia Art Museum certainly would agree.
04/wsj_0450:Two Mexican college dropouts, not professional art thieves, have been arrested for a 1985 Christmas Eve burglary from the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.
04/wsj_0450:About 140 Mayan, Aztec, Mixtec and Zapotec objects, including some of Mexico's best-known archaeological treasures, were taken.
04/wsj_0450:The government offered a reward for the return of the antiquities, but routine police work led to the recovery.
04/wsj_0450:Then they took the art to Acapulco and began to trade some of it for cocaine.
04/wsj_0450:Information from an arrested drug trafficker led to the two men and the recovery of almost all the stolen art. 
04/wsj_0450:Among other happy news bulletins from the German Democratic Republic, the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts announced that it has recovered "Cemetery in the Snow," a painting by the German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich.
04/wsj_0450:The artist's melancholy subjects bring high prices on the world market, and the U.S. State Department notified IFAR of the theft in February 1988.
04/wsj_0450:According to a source at the East Europe desk, two previously convicted felons were charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to prison terms of four and 12 years. 
04/wsj_0450:The precious canvas, cut from its frame at the time of the theft, was found in nearby Jena, hidden in the upholstery of an easy chair in the home of the girlfriend of one of the thieves.
04/wsj_0450:Trompe l'oeil painting is meant to fool the eye, but Robert Lawrence Trotter, 35, of Kennett Square, Pa., took his fooling seriously.
04/wsj_0450:He painted one himself in the style of John Haberle and sold it as a 19th-century original to antique dealers in Woodbridge, Conn.
04/wsj_0450:Mr. Trotter's painting showed a wall of wood boards with painted ribbons tacked down in a rectangle; tucked behind the ribbons were envelopes, folded, faded and crumpled papers and currency.
04/wsj_0450:Mr. Trotter's fake Haberle was offered at a bargain price of $25,000 with a phony story that it belonged to his wife's late aunt in New Canaan, Conn. 
04/wsj_0450:They persuaded Mr. Trotter to take it back and, with the help of the FBI, taped their conversation with him.
04/wsj_0450:Ms. Lowenthal is executive director of the International Foundation for Art Research (IFAR). 
04/wsj_0451:Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling about 3,600 of its 1990-model Escorts because the windshield adhesive was improperly applied to some cars. 
04/wsj_0451:As a result of the adhesive problem on the Ford Escort subcompacts, windshields may easily separate from the car during frontal impact, the U.S. auto maker said.
04/wsj_0451:A Ford spokesman said the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker isn't aware of any injuries caused by the windshield problem.
04/wsj_0451:Mazda and Ford said a combination of limited crankcase ventilation and improper maintenance could cause engine oil in some of the Mercury Tracers and Mazda 323s to deteriorate more rapidly than normal, causing increased engine noise or reduced engine life.
04/wsj_0451:Separately, Ford said it will offer $750 cash rebates to buyers of its 1990-model Ford Bronco sport utility vehicle.
04/wsj_0451:It said it will also offer buyers the option of financing as low as 6.9% on 24-month loans.
04/wsj_0452:The high court's decision, expected next spring, may affect the stability of many large corporate pension plans that have relied on the availability of pension insurance provided by the federal pension regulatory and insurance agency. 
04/wsj_0452:It recently reported assets of $2.4 billion and liabilities of $4 billion. 
04/wsj_0452:In its appeal to the high court, the agency said the federal appeals court ruling, which favored LTV, threatened to transform the agency from an insurer of troubled pension plans into an "open-ended source of industry bailouts." 
04/wsj_0452:The filing was partly the result of the $2.3 billion shortfall in LTV's three pension plans operated for its LTV Steel Co. subsidiary's employees. 
04/wsj_0452:A few months later, under pressure from the United Steelworkers of America, LTV instituted a new program to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans.
04/wsj_0452:But the agency viewed the creation of the new plans as an abuse of federal pension law and an attempt to transfer the liability of the $2.3 billion shortfall from LTV to federal insurance.
04/wsj_0452:The appeals court said there was no evidence that Congress intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to reassume liability for old plans.
04/wsj_0452:The company hasn't been able to come up with a reorganization plan, in part, because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency. 
04/wsj_0453:Nissan Motor is just one of a slew of advertisers that have hitched their ads to the devastating San Francisco quake and Hurricane Hugo.
04/wsj_0453:But the strategy can backfire; if the ads appear too self-serving, the companies may end up looking like rank opportunists instead of good Samaritans. 
04/wsj_0453:That hasn't deterred plenty of companies.
04/wsj_0453:Other ads don't bother with the fundraising; a touching, if self-congratulatory, American Telephone & Telegraph ad that aired Sunday intermixed footage of the devastation in San Francisco and Charleston, S.C., with interviews of people recounting how AT&T helped. 
04/wsj_0453:At Nissan, "we felt we wanted to do something to help them gather money, and we had this airtime on Monday Night Football," explains Brooke Mitzel, a Nissan advertising creative manager. "What did we get out of it?
04/wsj_0453:The ads are just the latest evidence of how television advertising is getting faster on the draw.
04/wsj_0453:While TV commercials typically take weeks to produce, advertisers in the past couple of years have learned to turn on a dime, to crash out ads in days or even hours.
04/wsj_0453:The big brokerage houses learned the art of the instant commercial after the 1987 crash, when they turned out reassuring ads inviting investors right back into the stock market.
04/wsj_0453:They trotted out another crop of instant commercials after the sudden market dip a few weeks ago.
04/wsj_0453:They chance alienating the customers they hope to woo by looking like opportunistic sharks. "People see extra messages in advertising, and if a manufacturer is clearly trying to get something out of it . . . if it's too transparent . . . then consumers will see through that," warns John Philip Jones, chairman of the advertising department at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. 
04/wsj_0453:"It can backfire because companies can step across the line and go too far, be too pushy," agrees Gary Stibel, a principal with New England Consulting Group, Westport, Conn. "The ultimate form of charity is when you don't tell anyone." Still, he says that only a few of the quake-related campaigns have been "tasteless" and that "the majority have been truly beneficial to the people who need the help.
04/wsj_0453:Burger King's chief executive officer, Barry Gibbons, stars in ads saying that the fast-food chain will donate 25 cents to the Red Cross for every purchase of a BK Doubles hamburger.
04/wsj_0453:While the campaign was Mr. Gibbons's idea, however, he won't be paying for it: The donations will come out of the chain's national advertising fund, which is financed by the franchisees.
04/wsj_0453:Toyota's upscale Lexus division, a sponsor of the World Series, also put in a plug for Red Cross donations in a World Series game it sponsored. "The World Series is brought to you by Lexus, who urges you to help relieve the suffering caused by the recent earthquake . . . ," the game announcer said.
04/wsj_0453:And New York Life made a plea for Red Cross donations in newspaper ads in the San Francisco area, latching onto the coattails of the Red Cross's impeccable reputation: "The Red Cross has been helping people for 125 years.
04/wsj_0453:NEW ACCOUNT: Northrup King Co., Golden Valley, Minn., awarded its $4 million field-crop-seeds account to Creswell, Munsell, Fultz & Zirbel, a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, division of Young & Rubicam.
04/wsj_0455:The Supreme Court let stand a New York court's ruling that the manufacturers of a drug once used to prevent miscarriages must share liability for injuries or deaths when the maker of an individual dose is unknown. 
04/wsj_0455:The most immediate effect is in New York, where former manufacturers of the anti-miscarriage drug DES -- the synthetic female hormone diethylstilbestrol -- face the prospect of shared liability for damages in many of the 700 to 1,000 DES lawsuits pending in that state.
04/wsj_0455:The lawsuits stemmed from the development of cancer and other problems in the daughters of women who took the drug. 
04/wsj_0455:On a broader scale, the ruling could encourage other states' courts to adopt the logic of the New York court, not only in DES cases but in other product-related lawsuits, as well. 
04/wsj_0455:The New York Court of Appeals ruling parallels a 1980 decision by the California Supreme Court requiring shared liability among manufacturers for injuries when it can't be determined which company is at fault.
04/wsj_0455:Paul Rheingold, a New York lawyer who represents DES victims, said that before the New York ruling, only the states of Washington and Wisconsin had followed the California decision.
04/wsj_0455:The high court refused to hear appeals by Rexall Drug Co., which went out of business in 1987 and was taken over by RXDC Liquidating Trust; E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc., a unit of Squibb Corp.; and Eli Lilly & Co. 
04/wsj_0455:In 1971, the FDA banned the use of DES after studies linked it to cancer and other problems in daughters of women who took the drug. 
04/wsj_0455:In many cases, the lawsuit was filed long after the drug was used -- the cancer in the daughters was typically not detected for years -- and there is no way to prove which of several companies manufactured the doses consumed by certain women. 
04/wsj_0455:But in its ruling last April, the New York court said that all producers of the anti-miscarriage drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific dose can't be determined.
04/wsj_0455:Each company's share of liability would be based on their share of the national DES market. 
04/wsj_0455:The New York court also upheld a state law, passed in 1986, extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing DES lawsuits.
04/wsj_0455:The effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one-year extension. (Rexall Drug Co. vs.
04/wsj_0455:Last year, the Supreme Court defined when companies, such as military contractors, may defend themselves against lawsuits for deaths or injuries by asserting that they were simply following specifications of a federal government contract.
04/wsj_0455:In that decision, the high court said a company must prove that the government approved precise specifications for the contract, that those specifications were met and that the government was warned of any dangers in use of the equipment. 
04/wsj_0455:But last February, a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a damage award against General Dynamics, rejecting the company's use of the government contractor defense.
04/wsj_0455:General Dynamics was sued by the families of five Navy divers who were killed in 1982 after they re-entered a submarine through a diving chamber.
04/wsj_0455:The accident was caused by faulty operation of a valve.
04/wsj_0455:-- Let stand the mail fraud and conspiracy conviction of John Lavery, a former vice president of Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp., a unit of Nestle S.A.
04/wsj_0455:The conviction stemmed from federal charges of consumer fraud for sale of phony infant apple juice between 1978 and 1983. (Lavery vs.
04/wsj_0455:-- Left intact an award of $1.5 million in damages against Dow Chemical Co. in the death of an Oregon man from exposure to Agent Orange.
04/wsj_0455:The award was made by a federal court to the widow of a U.S. Forest Service employee who contracted Hodgkin's disease after using herbicides containing Agent Orange in a weed-killing program. (Dow Chemical Co. vs.
04/wsj_0456:If he follows the correct path, he may be able to look back on this election as the high-water mark of far-left opposition.

04/wsj_0456:Net foreign investment through August this year has been running at a pace of $12.5 billion, about double the year-earlier rate.
04/wsj_0456:He should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income, in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher, not lower, revenues.
04/wsj_0456:He could do more to cut public subsidies and transfers, thus making funds available for public services starved of money for six years. 
04/wsj_0456:They, as well as numerous Latin American and East European countries that hope to adopt elements of the Spanish model, are supporting the direction Spain is taking.

04/wsj_0457:TREASURY BILLS: Results of the Monday, October 30, 1989, auction of short-term U.S. government bills, sold at a discount from face value in units of $10,000 to $1 million: 7.78%, 13 weeks; 7.62%, 26 weeks. 
04/wsj_0457:Annualized average rate of return after expenses for the past 30 days; not a forecast of future returns. 
04/wsj_0458:Just when American liberalism had pulled the arms plug on the Contras and their friend Ronald Reagan, along comes Mr. Ortega in Costa Rica this weekend to "blunder" into the hands of what are often called conservatives.
04/wsj_0458:Liberals are the faction that says, Give peace a chance; now they are saying Mr. Ortega should give them a break, lest the conservatives ask them to vote for bullets instead of bandages. 
04/wsj_0458:It is the presence of internal and external "enemies" which justifies the need for a large, active army that Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union continues to supply with bullets. 
04/wsj_0460:Cetus Corp. said the government of Spain approved the marketing of its Proleukin interleukin-2 drug to treat kidney cancer. 
04/wsj_0461:The Treasury Department proposed that banks be required to keep detailed records of international wire transfers, which officials believe is the main vehicle used by drug traffickers to move billions of dollars in and out of the U.S. 
04/wsj_0461:In recent testimony on Capitol Hill, Treasury officials said they were considering the new reporting requirements, and the expected publication of the proposal in the Federal Register today is the first official step toward creating final regulations.
04/wsj_0461:Among the possibilities the Treasury is considering are requirements that banks keep records identifying the originators and recipients of international wire transfers.
04/wsj_0461:Banks now are required only to report cash deposits or withdrawals of $10,000 or more.
04/wsj_0461:Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), chairman of a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that oversees the issue of money laundering, criticized the proposal for ignoring wire transfers between foreign banks that are executed and cleared on U.S. wire systems.
04/wsj_0462:But some holders of the Western Union notes expect the company to propose a more-attractive debt swap that will give them a substantial equity stake in the company.
04/wsj_0462:Western Union has had major losses in recent years as its telex business has faltered in the face of competition from facsimile machines and as other business ventures have gone awry. 
04/wsj_0462:The $500 million in notes, the largest chunk of Western Union's $640 million in long-term debt, stems from the company's major restructuring in December 1987.
04/wsj_0462:Western Union had offered to swap each $1,000 face amount of the notes for six shares of common stock and two new debt issues: a $500 note paying an interest rate starting at 16.75% annually and rising in later years, due in 1992, and a $500 note, due in 1997, paying a fixed rate of 17% and including rights protecting a holder against a decline in the trading price of the bond. 
04/wsj_0463:Genentech Inc. said the West German distributor of its heart drug TPA reached a joint marketing agreement with a subsidiary of Hoechst AG, which makes the rival anti-clotting agent streptokinase. 
04/wsj_0464:The OTC market now has declined in eight of the past 11 sessions. 
04/wsj_0464:Meanwhile, the index of the 100 biggest non-financial stocks, the Nasdaq 100, gained 0.47 to 438.15. 
04/wsj_0464:Profit-taking accounted for much of the slide in OTC stock prices, according to David Mills, senior vice president of Boston Company Advisers.
04/wsj_0464:The selling by money managers and individual investors is turning traders bearish as well. "We are advising a lot of our clients to make moves that make sense to them, rather than waiting until the last minute, because things have been so volatile," said William Sulya, head of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
04/wsj_0464:Ralph Costanza, head of the OTC trading department at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, said many market players are awaiting some resolution of the current debate over program trading. 
04/wsj_0464:Much of the market's recent volatility has been blamed on this large-scale computerized trading technique that can send stock prices surging or plummeting in a matter of minutes.
04/wsj_0464:Weisfield's surged 14 to 53 after agreeing in principle to be acquired by a unit of Ratners Group for $50 a share.
04/wsj_0464:Jaguar assumed its recently customary place on the OTC most active list as its American depository receipts gained 1/4 to 11 7/8 on volume of 1.2 million shares and Daimler-Benz joined the list of companies interested in the British car maker.
04/wsj_0464:Meanwhile, General Motors and Ford Motor continue their pursuit of the company.
04/wsj_0464:Ford has acquired more than 13% of Jaguar's shares, and GM has received U.S. regulatory clearance to buy 15%. 
04/wsj_0464:The company reported third-quarter operating profit of 37 cents a share, compared with 12 cents a share a year earlier.
04/wsj_0464:A third-quarter charge of $3.5 million related to planned restaurant closings resulted in a net loss for the quarter. 
04/wsj_0464:Employers Casualty had a loss of $3.6 million in the year-earlier quarter. 
04/wsj_0464:Late Friday, the company reported a loss of $51.3 million for the third quarter after earning $9.2 million a year before. 
04/wsj_0464:The bank also said it will establish a loan-loss reserve of $2.5 million to $4 million against a construction loan that is in default. 
04/wsj_0465:Medical scientists are starting to uncover a handful of genes which, if damaged, unleash the chaotic growth of cells that characterizes cancer. 
04/wsj_0465:Scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops.
04/wsj_0465:An emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention. 
04/wsj_0465:"It's a super-exciting set of discoveries," says Bert Vogelstein, a Johns Hopkins University researcher who has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer. "Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level.
04/wsj_0465:Today, we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and, then, propel it into a deadly state." 
04/wsj_0465:Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors, or simply anti-cancer genes.
04/wsj_0465:The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes.
04/wsj_0465:In recent months, researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert: An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged. 
04/wsj_0465:A person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene, or in whom one copy is damaged early in life, is especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop. 
04/wsj_0465:Emerging genetic tests will be able to spot such cancer-susceptible individuals, ushering in what some scientists believe is a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis. 
04/wsj_0465:Bill and Bonnie Quinlan are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings.
04/wsj_0465:The Dedham, Mass., couple knew even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50% chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma, an eye cancer that occurs about once every 20,000 births.
04/wsj_0465:Because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, it became possible last January to find out what threat the Quinlan baby faced.
04/wsj_0465:A test using new "genetic probes" showed that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and, therefore, faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer. "It made our New Year," says Mr. Quinlan. 
04/wsj_0465:Equally important, the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth, made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja, has opened a field of cancer study, which in recent months has exploded. "It turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer," says Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute. "All this may not be obvious to the public, which is concerned about advances in treatment, but I am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon." 
04/wsj_0465:To date, scientists have fingered two of these cancer-suppressors.
04/wsj_0465:Colon, lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease, collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans a year.
04/wsj_0465:Researchers say the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, alone or in combination, appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain, the skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix.
04/wsj_0465:There is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes, they are especially prone to cancer, perhaps explaining, finally, why some cancers seem to haunt certain families. 
04/wsj_0465:The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s, when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects.
04/wsj_0465:He theorized that in the eye cancer, an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other.
04/wsj_0465:Back then, scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes, but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes.
04/wsj_0465:Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease.
04/wsj_0465:Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing.
04/wsj_0465:Then, a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee, then at the University of Utah, found the answer.
04/wsj_0465:The team used a battery of the newly developed "gene probes," snippets of genetic material that can track a gene's presence in a cell.
04/wsj_0465:By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors, they found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome. 
04/wsj_0465:It was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer. "It was extraordinarily satisfying," says Dr. Knudson, now at Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in Philadelphia. "I was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers." 
04/wsj_0465:His was one of two research teams in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm's tumor. 
04/wsj_0465:It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel, which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring. 
04/wsj_0465:Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student, Eric Fearon, began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage.
04/wsj_0465:They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions, some existing only in benign polyps, others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells.
04/wsj_0465:Gradually, a coherent picture of cancer development emerged.
04/wsj_0465:If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out, benign polyps would develop.
04/wsj_0465:If both copies of a second gene were then deleted, the polyps would progress to malignancy.
04/wsj_0465:Their report galvanized other molecular biologists. "It was the confirming evidence we all needed that {gene} losses were critical to the development of a common tumor," says Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City. 
04/wsj_0465:But Dr. Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that, if damaged, flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy.
04/wsj_0465:For months the Johns Hopkins researchers, using gene probes, experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17, looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells.
04/wsj_0465:Such a piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene. 
04/wsj_0465:Despite that, when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene they had found in the human cancer cells with the Mr. Levine's p53 gene they found the two were identical; it turned out that in Mr. Levine's cancer studies, he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene. 
04/wsj_0465:The discovery "suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation," says Robert Weinberg, a leader in cancer-gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass. 
04/wsj_0465:Researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors, one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies.
04/wsj_0465:The scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families, the gene, when inherited in a damaged form, may predispose women to the cancer. 
04/wsj_0465:There also are reports from several labs, as yet unpublished, of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney, brain and skin cancers. 
04/wsj_0465:Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer, a researcher in Great Britain, are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer, thought to be on chromosome 5. 
04/wsj_0465:Dr. Minna believes people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer.
04/wsj_0465:Already two major pharmaceutical companies, the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and, maybe, new therapies. 
04/wsj_0465:The idea would be to administer to patients the growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes.
04/wsj_0465:In any case, says Dr. Minna of the National Cancer Institute, "We're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer." 
04/wsj_0466:Many investors give Michael Foods about as much chance of getting it together as Humpty Dumpty.
04/wsj_0466:But now at least there's a glimmer of hope for the stock. 
04/wsj_0466:Burger King, which breaks thousands of fresh eggs each morning, is quietly switching over to an alternative egg product made by Michael Foods.
04/wsj_0466:When the company this month announced lower-than-forecast sales of Easy Eggs, the stock dropped nearly 19%. 
04/wsj_0466:Michael won't confirm the identities of any Easy Egg customers, nor will it say much of anything else.
04/wsj_0466:Two Minneapolis shareholder suits in the past month have accused top officers of making "various untrue statements." These federal-court suits accuse the officers of failing to disclose that Easy Eggs were unlikely to sell briskly enough to justify all of Michael's production capacity. 
04/wsj_0466:The Miami fast-food chain, owned by Grand Metropolitan of Britain, expects to consume roughly 34 million pounds of liquefied eggs annually. 
04/wsj_0466:Perhaps to debunk the analysts' talk of over-capacity, Michael today will take some of the skeptics on a tour of its new Gaylord, Minn., plant. 
04/wsj_0466:There has been no announcement of the Burger King arrangement by either party, possibly for fear that McDonald's and other fast-food rivals would seize on it in scornful advertising.
04/wsj_0466:The extent of Marriott's use isn't known, and Marriott officials couldn't be reached for comment. 
04/wsj_0466:Michael Foods has attracted a good many short-sellers, the people who sell borrowed shares in a bet that a stock price will drop and allow the return of cheaper shares to the lender.
04/wsj_0466:"The stock, in my opinion, is going to go lower, not only because of disappointing earnings but {because} the credibility gap is certainly not closing," says L. Craig Carver of Dain Bosworth. 
04/wsj_0466:But the spokesman added that while Michael will earn less than last year's $1.20 a share, it thinks Street estimates of $1 or so are low.) 
04/wsj_0466:Analyst Robin Young of John Kinnard & Co., Minneapolis, calls himself "the last remaining bull on the stock." He argues that Michael Foods is misunderstood: "This is a growth company in the packaged food industry -- a rare breed, like finding a white rhino." Earnings aren't keeping pace, he says, because of heavy investments in the egg technologies and drought-related costs in its potato business. 
04/wsj_0466:Mr. Carver, however, believes the company's egg product won't help the bottom line in the short run, even though it "makes sense -- it's more convenient" and justifies its price, which is higher than shell eggs, because of health and sanitation concerns. 
04/wsj_0466:Michael, which also processes potatoes, still relies on spuds for about a fourth of its sales and nearly half its pretax profit.
04/wsj_0466:But dry growing conditions in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota are pushing spot prices of potatoes beyond what Michael contracted to pay last spring.
04/wsj_0467:Analysts say Quebecor's purchase is part of a trend toward consolidation in the North American printing industry.
04/wsj_0467:Along with Donnelley, says Jacques Massicotte, an analyst with Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc. in Montreal, "Quebecor has positioned itself as one of the two key players." He adds: "I think this is a great strategic move for Quebecor.
04/wsj_0467:Mr. Peladeau says he isn't trying to catch up to Donnelley, which has annual sales of over $3 billion. "Size doesn't matter," Mr. Peladeau says. "What counts is the bottom line." 
04/wsj_0467:Some of Mr. Peladeau's ventures, including an earlier push into the U.S. market, haven't paid off on the bottom line.
04/wsj_0467:Mr. Peladeau took his first big gamble 25 years ago, when he took advantage of a strike at La Presse, then Montreal's dominant French-language newspaper, to launch the Journal de Montreal.
04/wsj_0467:Mr. Peladeau has never made any apologies for publishing the tabloid, a brash mix of crime and sports. "I've read Balzac," he answers critics. "It's tabloid news from A to Z." 
04/wsj_0467:Quebecor also publishes a second tabloid in Montreal, the struggling 18-month-old Montreal Daily News; dailies in Quebec City and Winnipeg, Manitoba; and dozens of weeklies covering most of Quebec.
04/wsj_0467:A series of recent acquisitions made it the dominant magazine publisher in Quebec.
04/wsj_0467:After a recent merger, it is also the only province-wide distributor of magazines and newspapers in Quebec.
04/wsj_0467:Finally, with Maxwell Communication, the company controls 54% of Donohue Inc., a Quebec City pulp and paper concern. 
04/wsj_0467:Quebecor will own 57.5% of the new subsidiary.
04/wsj_0467:Pierre-Karl Peladeau, the founder's son and the executive in charge of the acquisition, says Quebecor hasn't decided how it will finance its share of the purchase, but he says it most likely will use debt. 
04/wsj_0467:Maxwell's sale of its U.S. printing unit was expected, the last major business to be disposed of in a major reshuffling of assets.
04/wsj_0468:G.D. Searle & Co. said the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of Kerlone, a hypertension drug developed by a joint venture between Searle and a French concern. 
04/wsj_0468:Searle, a unit of Monsanto Co., said the "beta-blocker" high-blood-pressure drug Kerlone is the first product to reach the market through Lorex Pharmaceuticals, the U.S. company jointly owned by Searle and Synthelabo, a French pharmaceutical concern owned by France's L'Oreal S.A. 
04/wsj_0469:The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges that New York's mandatory retirement age of 76 violates federal law. 
04/wsj_0469:The commission's filing in that case challenges Connecticut's mandatory retirement age of 70 for appointed judges. 
04/wsj_0469:The New York suit was filed on behalf of Justice Isaac Rubin, whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end, and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination.
04/wsj_0469:The suit, assigned to federal Judge Kimba Wood, seeks a permanent injunction, back pay for judges who have been forced to retire, reinstatement of retired judges and "other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of (New York's) unlawful employment practices." 
04/wsj_0469:Justice Rubin, a state judge since 1969, said the mandatory-retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench. 
04/wsj_0469:The issue is one of a judge's experience, his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench," Justice Rubin said. "I've had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities." Because Justice Rubin turned 76 on May 9, he isn't eligible to be reappointed to the bench at the end of the year. 
04/wsj_0469:A spokeswoman for the state's Office of Court Administration declined to comment on the suit.
04/wsj_0469:The parties in the Connecticut case have agreed to stay proceedings pending the appeal of another EEOC age-bias case against Vermont.
04/wsj_0469:In the Vermont case, a federal judge ruled that the state's mandatory age of 70 for appointed judges was illegal; Vermont's appeal of that decision is pending before the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. 
04/wsj_0469:U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's plan to dissolve the 14 regional organized-crime strike forces is expected to go into effect next month, despite the opposition of Democratic congressional leaders and lawyers in the special units. 
04/wsj_0469:He says the strike-force lawyers will work more efficiently under the supervision of U.S. attorneys. 
04/wsj_0469:The Eastern District unit in Brooklyn, N.Y., lost seven of its 15 attorneys this year partly because the lawyers were troubled by the proposed reorganization, says Laura A. Brevetti, who left the strike force to join Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein, a New York law firm. 
04/wsj_0469:But Mr. Runkel contends there has been no exodus of strike-force lawyers.
04/wsj_0469:Among other things, the bill calls for a reorganization of the Justice Department.
04/wsj_0469:WHITMAN & RANSOM recruits lawyers from disbanding firm: The 204-lawyer New York firm will bring in at least 12 partners and a not yet determined number of associates from Golenbock & Barell, which will dissolve Dec. 31.
04/wsj_0470:Warner has filed a $1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Sony and the Guber-Peters duo, who in turn are countersuing Warner for trying to interfere in Sony's acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Guber Peters Entertainment Co. in two transactions valued at over $5 billion. 
04/wsj_0470:Although settlement talks had been dropped, attorneys for the two sides apparently began talking again yesterday in an attempt to settle the matter before Thursday, when a judge is expected to rule on Warner's request for an injunction that would block the two producers from taking over the management of Columbia.
04/wsj_0470:Yesterday, in documents filed in connection with that case, Warner accused Sony officials of falsely claiming that they never read the five-year contract requiring the two producers to make movies exclusively for Columbia, citing Securities and Exchange Commission filings made by Sony that described the contracts. 
04/wsj_0470:Warner was referring to documents filed last week in which Sony Corp. of America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof and Walter Yetnikoff, president of its CBS Records unit, said they had taken Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters at their word when the producers told them that getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement. 
04/wsj_0470:Wayne Smith, an attorney at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles representing Sony, said the Sony executives hadn't seen the contract because "it wasn't relevant once Guber and Peters told them Warner would let them terminate it at any time." Mr. Smith said statements about the contract made in SEC filings were made by attorneys who did have access to the contracts but who weren't part of the negotiations between Sony and the duo. 
04/wsj_0470:Such a dual role would be "impractical and unethical," Warner said, adding, "that concept is as silly as suggesting that the head coach of the Los Angeles Dodgers could simultaneously be general manager of the San Francisco Giants." 
04/wsj_0470:Warner, which is in the process of being acquired by New York-based Time Warner Inc., also said it paid the two producers a fixed annual salary of $3 million. 
04/wsj_0472:In fact, the earnings report unfolded as representatives of the world's No. 1 jet maker and the striking Machinists union came back to the negotiating table for their first meeting in two weeks.
04/wsj_0472:The company's total firm backlog of unfilled orders at Sept. 30 stood at a mighty $69.1 billion, compared with $53.6 billion at the end of 
04/wsj_0472:Before the union rejected the company's offer and the strike was launched with the graveyard shift of Oct. 4, Boeing had been counting on turning 96 aircraft out the door in the present period.
04/wsj_0472:That included 21 of the company's 747-400 jumbo jets, its most successful product. 
04/wsj_0472:Phillip Brannon of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets added: "You don't want to minimize this and say nobody is looking at it.
04/wsj_0472:Because of cost overruns on fixed-price military work, Mr. Shrontz said, the company's defense business will record "a significant loss" in 1989. 
04/wsj_0472:And, of course, there's the unsteady labor situation.
04/wsj_0472:Besides the Machinists pact, accords representing 30,000 of the company's engineering and technical employees in the Puget Sound and Wichita, Kan., areas expire in early December.
04/wsj_0472:The Machinists rejected a proposal featuring a 10% base wage increase over the life of the three-year contract, plus bonuses of 8% the first year and 3% the second.
04/wsj_0472:On top of that, Boeing would make cost-of-living adjustments projected to be 5% for each year of the contract. 
04/wsj_0472:The union, though, has called the offer "insulting." The company reiterated yesterday that it's willing to reconfigure the package, but not add to the substance of it. 
04/wsj_0472:They added that the settlement is the culmination of a 2 1/2-year investigation into the company's aluminum pricing practices in connection with KC-135s. 
04/wsj_0473:The application by Foothills, owned by Calgary-based Nova Corp. of Alberta and Westcoast Energy Inc. of Vancouver, Canada, is expected to kick off what could be a contentious battle for the right to transport vast quantities of gas to southern markets from still-undeveloped fields in Canada's Mackenzie River delta. 
04/wsj_0473:"This is a pre-emptive strike by Foothills," said Rick Hillary, natural gas manager of the Calgary-based Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group. 
04/wsj_0473:Another is expected from a consortium of oil and gas producers who won conditional approval this month from Canada's National Energy Board to export about 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta gas to the U.S. starting in 1996. 
04/wsj_0473:The producers include Shell Canada Ltd., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group; Esso Resources Canada Ltd., a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd., which is 71%-owned by Exxon Corp.; and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. 
04/wsj_0473:"The {National Energy Board} approval of the exports just waved the starting flag for the next stage, the rush to build facilities to transport the gas," said Bill Koerner, an analyst with Brady & Berliner, a Washington, D.C., law firm. 
04/wsj_0473:The Toronto-based company, together with Tenneco Inc. of Houston, has had an incomplete proposal filed with Canadian regulators since 1984 that it is now updating. 
04/wsj_0473:Like Foothills, TransCanada's Polar Gas consortium plans to build a pipeline directly south from the Mackenzie River delta in Canada's western Arctic with an initial capacity to transport 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily.
04/wsj_0473:Industry sources said they expect a fierce battle to emerge between TransCanada, which has a monopoly on Canadian gas transportation east of Alberta, and Nova and Westcoast, which control the pipelines within and running west of Alberta, respectively. 
04/wsj_0473:But last week Gerald Maier, president and chief executive officer of TransCanada, said the company "intends to be a party to any transportation system that goes up there" and that it would consider joint ventures with other players to ensure it has a role. 
04/wsj_0473:A number of issues still need to be resolved before Canadian regulators give any project the final go-ahead. 
04/wsj_0473:First, the price of natural gas will have to almost double.
04/wsj_0473:Kent Jesperson, president of Foothills, said the company believes the project would be viable if gas prices reach US$3.25 a thousand cubic feet by 1995, in current dollars, up from a current spot price of about US$1.50. 
04/wsj_0473:Robert Pierce, chairman and chief executive of Foothills, said it's too early to say whether Alaskan or Mackenzie delta gas would flow to market first.
04/wsj_0473:It's also likely that regulators will try to forge some kind of consensus between the would-be pipeline builders before undertaking any hearings into rival projects.
04/wsj_0473:Douglas Stoneman, vice president of Shell Canada, noted that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down development. 
04/wsj_0473:Interprovincial Pipe Line Co., an oil pipeline operator rumored to be mulling a gas pipeline proposal of its own, said that isn't in the cards.
04/wsj_0473:Instead, Richard Haskayne, president and chief executive of Interprovincial's Calgary-based parent, Interhome Energy Inc., said the company would prefer to work with other "interested parties" on a joint proposal. 
04/wsj_0473:As for Foothills' pre-emptive bid, Mr. Haskayne said, "If they think it gives them some kind of priority position, well, that's their strategy." 
04/wsj_0474:The Federal Reserve Board said it is delaying approval of First Union Corp. 's proposed $849 million acquisition of Florida National Banks of Florida Inc., pending the outcome of an examination into First Union's lending practices in low-income neighborhoods. 
04/wsj_0474:During the summer, Legal Services Corp., a Florida legal aid group, filed a petition with the Fed on behalf of residents in four Florida counties.
04/wsj_0474:In deferring action on the merger, the Fed said, "The Board does not believe that there is sufficient information in the record at this time to allow {it} to reach a final conclusion on First Union's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the communities it serves in Florida and North Carolina, including low to moderate-income neighborhoods in those communities." 
04/wsj_0474:The Fed said the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to begin a Community Reinvestment Act examination of First Union's Florida and North Carolina banking units in the next two weeks. 
04/wsj_0474:First Union, with assets of about $32 billion, said it was disappointed by the delay but said it would cooperate with regulatory authorities.
04/wsj_0474:The bank added that it believes the review will "demonstrate that First Union is in compliance with the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act." The company has already missed its initial Oct. 1 target date for completing the merger.
04/wsj_0475:That means Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp. of Houston, can go forward with its pitch for creditor approval as early as today, when it is expected to deliver a revised reorganization plan to the committee.
04/wsj_0475:Texas Air has run into difficulty reselling about $20 million of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market, the person said.
04/wsj_0475:An Eastern spokesman said "the $40 million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of Eastern's plan.
04/wsj_0475:Forty million in the total scheme of things is not that significant." 
04/wsj_0475:Earlier this month the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman, Sachs & Co., the experts hired by the creditors, contended that Eastern would have difficulty meeting earnings targets the airline was projecting.
04/wsj_0476:New York City -- $813.4 million of general obligation bonds, Fiscal 1990 Series C and D, including $757.4 million of tax-exempt bonds and $56 million of taxable bonds, tentatively priced by a Goldman Sachs & Co. group.
04/wsj_0476:Collateralized Mortgage Securities Corp. -- $150 million of Remic mortgage securities offered in 12 classes by First Boston Corp.
04/wsj_0476:It is backed by Government National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities with a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 29 years and being offered at market prices. 
04/wsj_0476:Beneficial Corp. -- $248.3 million of securities backed by home-equity loans through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
04/wsj_0476:The offering, with an expected average life of 3.2 years, will float monthly at 20 basis points above the rate on an index of 30-day double-A-rated commercial paper, which now yields about 8.50%.
04/wsj_0476:The issue has an expected final maturity date of 1998.
04/wsj_0476:The offering is rated triple-A by Moody's and S&P, based on the quality of the underlying home equity loans and a letter of credit covering 10% of the deal from Union Bank of Switzerland.
04/wsj_0476:Rochester Community Savings Bank -- $200 million of 8.85% certificates backed by automobile loans priced to yield 8.99% via First Boston Corp.
04/wsj_0476:The issue, through RCSB 1989-A Grantor Trust, was priced at a yield spread of 100 basis points above the Treasury 7 3/4% note due July 1991.
04/wsj_0476:The offering has an expected average life of 1.7 years and a final maturity date of May 15, 1995.
04/wsj_0476:The issue is rated triple-A by Moody's, based on the quality of the underlying auto loans and a letter of credit covering 13% of the deal from Credit Suisse. 
04/wsj_0476:South Australian Government Finance Authority (agency) -- 125 million Australian dollars of zero-coupon Eurobonds due Dec. 12, 1994, priced at 50.9375 to yield 15.06% less fees via Hambros Bank Ltd. Guaranteed by the South Australian Treasury.
04/wsj_0476:Government Insurance Office of New South Wales (agency) -- A$50 million of 17 1/2% Eurobonds due Dec. 4, 1991, priced at 101.95 to yield 17.06 less fees via Westpac Banking Corp. Fees 1 1/4. 
04/wsj_0476:Swedish Export Credit Corp. (Sweden) -- 100 million Swiss francs of 6 1/8% privately placed notes due Sept. 30, 1996, priced at 100 3/4 to yield 5.99% via Citicorp Investment Bank Switzerland.
04/wsj_0477:Allianz said it won French government approval to buy as much as one-third of Navigation Mixte, a diversified financial, transport and food holding company.
04/wsj_0477:The move comes a week after Paribas announced that it was preparing to bid for 66.7% control of Navigation Mixte. 
04/wsj_0477:Munich-based Allianz's brief explanatory statement said it is acting to protect its own interests as a shareholder of Navigation Mixte.
04/wsj_0477:Allianz's entry reflects the increasing eagerness of West German companies, looking ahead to the reduction in European Community internal barriers in 1992, to get involved in what until now were considered internal French affairs.
04/wsj_0477:Lately, analysts say, Deutsche Bank has shocked some in the French financial community by indicating it wants a strong bank with a large number of branches. 
04/wsj_0477:While Allianz officials weren't willing to comment in any detail on their plans, they said Allianz currently holds between 5% and 10% of Navigation Mixte, an apparent increase from the 5% stake that Navigation Mixte officials had earlier announced.
04/wsj_0477:It was the first day of trading following the suspension of Navigation Mixte shares last Monday, when Paribas announced its plan to pay 1,850 francs for each Navigation Mixte share. 
04/wsj_0477:Allianz also holds a 50% stake in Navigation Mixte's insurance subsidiary, one of France's largest insurance groups, which it bought for about 6.5 billion francs just before Paribas launched its bid.
04/wsj_0477:Allianz also suggested, without saying so directly, that it regrets that Paribas isn't bidding for all of Navigation Mixte's shares.
04/wsj_0477:That displeases many current holders, such as Allianz, which couldn't be sure of selling all their shares if they tendered to Paribas. 
04/wsj_0477:Paribas already holds about 18.7% of Navigation Mixte, and the acquisition of the additional 48% would cost it about 11 billion francs under its current bid. 
04/wsj_0477:The bid values Navigation Mixte at around 23 billion francs, depending on how many holders of Navigation Mixte warrants exchange them for shares before the bid expires. 
04/wsj_0478:The company said Carol Cable, based in Pawtucket, R.I., is a leading supplier of electrical and electronic wire and cable for the distributor, retail and original equipment manufacturer markets. 
04/wsj_0478:Carol Cable, which operates 12 manufacturing plants, had operating profit of $11.7 million on sales of $153.3 million for the first six months of this year and operating profit of $25.6 million on sales of $294.6 million for all of 1988. 
04/wsj_0478:The maker of telecommunications and defense equipment said Carol Cable's portfolio and market focus would complement the company's current wire and cable businesses.
04/wsj_0478:The plan is subject to a satisfactory due diligence investigation of Carol Cable by Penn Central, a definitive agreement and regulatory approvals. 
04/wsj_0479:Fletcher Challenge, a big New Zealand-based forest products concern with forestry operations in Canada, said the assets include stakes in four natural gas fields and one oil field near Provost, Alberta, plus gas processing facilities and about 247,000 acres of undeveloped land.
04/wsj_0479:Amoco Canada Petroleum Co., which operates the major properties included in the asset package, said the sale is part of a plan to streamline its assets. 
04/wsj_0480:MiniScribe Corp., Longmont, Colo., said it introduced a one-inch high, 80-megabyte hard disk drive that it hopes will prove popular with makers of high-performance laptop and portable computers. 
04/wsj_0480:MiniScribe said it expects to begin full volume production of the drives in the U.S. and Singapore in the first quarter next year.
04/wsj_0480:A drive with 120 megabytes of capacity is scheduled for release during the third quarter of 1990. 
04/wsj_0480:After an internal investigation, the company found that senior officials used a variety of schemes to fabricate sales gains, including counting shipments of bricks and defective drives as sales. 
04/wsj_0481:The pact calls for the Times to pay dealers $3.6 million over six years, as well as other payments in the form of subsidies over three years, based on the number of "new customers started by the dealers and on pricing structures," the Times said. 
04/wsj_0481:The amount of the settlement will be taken as a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter.
04/wsj_0481:The settlement, which involves most of the 300 independent newspaper dealers in the New York area, will allow the Times to freely operate its own direct home delivery system. 
04/wsj_0481:Home delivery is the fastest growing segment of the Times's 1.1 million daily circulation.
04/wsj_0481:Currently, about 60% of home delivery subscribers in the New York area receive the paper directly from the Times. 
04/wsj_0482:Mercury Savings & Loan Association, Huntington Beach, Calif., reported a third-quarter loss of $3.9 million, or 61 cents a share, compared with net income of $1.4 million, or 22 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. 
04/wsj_0482:Mercury attributed the loss to rapid prepayments of loans and costs incurred in refinancing many house loans this past spring and summer, when interest rates dipped. 
04/wsj_0482:Mercury also is shrinking itself, part of its plan to change its emphasis from buying mortgage loans from mortgage brokers to making loans directly.
04/wsj_0482:Such a focus is "more profitable, more efficient and gives us a greater sense of control," said William A. Shane, Mercury's senior executive vice president.
04/wsj_0482:As of Sept. 30, Mercury's assets were $2.25 billion, down from $2.62 billion a year ago. 
04/wsj_0482:For the nine months, Mercury posted a loss of $5.4 million, or 86 cents share, against net income of $4 million, or 63 cents share, a year earlier. 
04/wsj_0483:Sigmund Levine, Bancroft secretary and treasurer, said the closed-end fund's directors will consider Mr. Green's offer in a couple of weeks at a regular meeting. "He hasn't added anything," Mr. Levine said, predicting the board will again reject Mr. Green's proposal. 
04/wsj_0483:He said Bancroft attorneys are scheduled to meet with Mr. Green's attorneys in Delaware Chancery Court at the end of this week to respond to the investor's request for company records for the past five years.
04/wsj_0484:Giant Group said a federal court in Delaware has denied a motion by Rally's Inc. seeking to block a group led by Giant Chairman Burt Sugarman from acquiring more of the company's shares. 
04/wsj_0484:Mr. Sugarman has in turn contended that the other major shareholder group -- whose interests are represented by three other directors connected to trusts in the name of the children of the company's founder, James Patterson -- has ties to a competing fast food chain, Wendy's International Inc. 
04/wsj_0484:The company last week assembled a three-member committee of directors aligned with neither side to analyze the situation.
04/wsj_0484:Each group controls more than 40% of Rally's stock.
04/wsj_0485:Singer Bette Midler won a $400,000 federal court jury verdict against Young & Rubicam in a case that threatens a popular advertising industry practice of using "sound-alike" performers to tout products. 
04/wsj_0485:The ad agency had approached Ms. Midler about appearing, but she declined, citing a longstanding policy of refusing advertising work.
04/wsj_0485:The agency then turned to a former backup singer for Ms. Midler who appeared in the ad and crooned what was generally considered a more than credible imitation of Ms. Midler's 1973 hit song "Do You Wanna Dance." 
04/wsj_0485:The appeals court held: "When a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to sell a product, the sellers have appropriated what is not theirs." 
04/wsj_0485:Peter Laird, a Los Angeles lawyer for Ms. Midler, said, "We believe that the verdict reaffirms her position and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies cannot with impunity imitate the voices of well-known performers.
04/wsj_0485:Last year's appeals court decision, for instance, spawned several suits, reportedly including a recent action by the heirs of singer Bobby Darin against McDonald's Corp. over its "Mac Tonight" TV commercials, a rough parody of Mr. Darin's "Mack the Knife" trademark. 
04/wsj_0485:Ms. Sinatra sued over the use of her "These Boots are Made for Walkin'" song in the ad. 
04/wsj_0485:At that time, the court held that such a claim would interfere with federal copyright law, which has always cracked down on the unauthorized copying of songs and musical compositions but never actual performances. 
04/wsj_0485:"One thing that is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in California coming up with a statement that Nancy Sinatra is not distinctive but that Bette Midler is.
04/wsj_0485:I am not sure that judges, many of whom I like very much, are proper repositories for making distinctions about pop singers," said Richard Kurnit, a New York advertising lawyer. 
04/wsj_0485:Nonetheless, Mr. Kurnit said that the latest decisions are having a chilling effect. "It has made people think twice about how they use music and is forcing them to be more circumspect about doing a particular rendition of a song in its most famous form," he said. 
04/wsj_0486:James River Corp., Richmond, Va., said it acquired the tissue operations of Buhrmann-Tetterode N.V. of the Netherlands for about $77 million. 
04/wsj_0486:The Dutch unit, known as Celtona B.V., is a leading maker of consumer and away-from-home tissue products for the Benelux region.
04/wsj_0486:In addition, the acquisition includes production assets of Invercon Papermils, a maker of household tissue products for the U.K. and Ireland.
04/wsj_0486:The combined operations had 1988 revenue of about $100 million. 
04/wsj_0486:James River, a maker of pulp, paper and plastic products, already has interests in tissue businesses in France, Spain, Italy and Turkey.
04/wsj_0486:The Celtona operations would become part of those ventures. 
04/wsj_0487:Vitro S.A. of Monterrey, Mexico, said its THR Corp. subsidiary has entered into definitive loan agreements in connection with Vitro's $21.25-a-share tender offer for Anchor Glass Container Corp. 
04/wsj_0487:The agreements are with Security Pacific National Bank and an affiliate of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. Proceeds of the loan agreement, together with funds from Vitro, will permit the purchase of all shares outstanding of Anchor and the payment of all related costs and expenses. 
04/wsj_0487:Vitro said the definitive agreements require that Anchor obtain a waiver from its bank lenders of existing covenant defaults under its bank facilities.
04/wsj_0488:The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 6.76 points in a spate of bargain-hunting following last week's declines. 
04/wsj_0488:"Attention is fixed on the stock market for lack of anything else to sink our teeth into," said Robert White, a vice president at First Interstate of California. 
04/wsj_0488:Some analysts predict that in the absence of market-moving news to push the U.S. unit sharply higher or lower, the currency is likely to drift below 1.80 marks this week. 
04/wsj_0488:In Tokyo Tuesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 142.32 yen, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 142.17 yen. 
04/wsj_0488:Last week, the surprise resignation of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson sent the British pound into a tailspin.

04/wsj_0488:He predicts the pound will continue to trade in a very volatile fashion, with "fits of being oversold and overbought" before recovering its losses.

04/wsj_0496:Cray Research Inc. won government clearance for its proposed reorganization of founder Seymour Cray's supercomputer design team into a separate company. 
04/wsj_0496:Internal Revenue Service approval of the move as a tax-free transaction was the last hurdle to splitting up the world's dominant maker of supercomputers, which Mr. Cray founded in 1974. 
04/wsj_0496:Cray's directors set Nov. 15 as the record date for distribution of shares in the new company, to be called Cray Computer Corp.
04/wsj_0496:Under the accord, Cray Research will transfer to Mr. Cray's fledgling operation $53.3 million of assets primarily related to the Cray-3 development project his team is undertaking and will lend Cray Computer $98.6 million.

04/wsj_0498:The filing in bankruptcy court here follows a string of quarterly losses and product glitches for the maker of harddisk drives for minicomputers and microcomputers. 
04/wsj_0498:Priam had a loss of $25.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 7, compared with year-earlier profit of $543,000, or two cents a share.
04/wsj_0498:The 200-person staff cutback announced yesterday will bring Priam's employment to about 380 workers, less than half of what it was before a similar, 230-person reduction in August. 
04/wsj_0498:The company yesterday also said it was scrapping one of its major new products, a 760-megabyte drive, which, while technically proficient, didn't hold much promise of generating substantial orders because financing problems caused a nine-month delay in getting the product to market. 
04/wsj_0499:The ministry said the swap, details of which were disclosed last Thursday, will allow both state-controlled companies to reinforce operations in their main markets and argued that the move shows the dynamism of France's state-sector concerns.

05/wsj_0501:Japanese companies have long been accused of sacrificing profit to boost sales.
05/wsj_0501:Japan's biggest computer maker last week undercut seven competitors to win a contract to design a mapping system for the city of Hiroshima's waterworks.
05/wsj_0501:Fujitsu said it issued the low bid because it wanted a foot in the door of a potentially lucrative market. 
05/wsj_0501:It's a kind of an investment." 
05/wsj_0501:Hiroshima's waterworks bureau said the municipal government had budgeted about 11 million yen ($77,500) for the project. "I was flabbergasted," Tatsuhara Yamane, head of the bureau, was quoted by Kyodo news service as saying. "I understand the firm's enthusiasm in getting the deal, but such a large company would have been better off showing a little more discretion." 
05/wsj_0501:The Fujitsu spokeswoman said headquarter officials didn't approve the bid in advance and will take measures so this kind of thing doesn't happen in the future. "It's contrary to common sense," she added. 
05/wsj_0501:Japanese local governments are expected to invest heavily in computer systems over the next few years, and many companies expect that field to provide substantial revenue. "In the near future, it will be a big market, not just for waterworks, but for all mapping systems," the Fujitsu spokeswoman said. "We can expect a hundreds-of-billions-of-yen market." 
05/wsj_0501:But the Japanese practice of deep discounting often is cited by Americans as a classic barrier to entry in Japan's market.
05/wsj_0502:American, a unit of AMR Corp., is the nation's largest airline. 
05/wsj_0502:Chicago has the largest population of citizens of Polish heritage in any city outside Poland.

05/wsj_0503:The West German retailing group also said that the results of the first three quarters suggest it will meet its profit goal for the year.
05/wsj_0503:Earnings at the department-store division, which generates the bulk of profit, should remain at least stable, while income at the mail-order and tourism units is likely to fall slightly from 1988, the company said. 
05/wsj_0504:The offer capped a week of rumors that Georgia-Pacific, an Atlanta-based forest-products company, was considering making a bid for Nekoosa, a paper-products concern based in Norwalk, Conn. 
05/wsj_0504:Analysts, however, were surprised because the tender offer appeared unsolicited. "It's quite a bombshell," said one, adding that the offer could spark a period of industry consolidation. 
05/wsj_0504:The two companies would appear to be a logical fit because of their complementary lines, and analysts described the offer, representing a 36% premium over Nekoosa's market price, as fair.
05/wsj_0504:The bid for Great Northern, a notice of which appears in an advertisement in today's Wall Street Journal, is the first big takeover offer since the collapse of a $6.79 billion buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. Oct. 13. 
05/wsj_0504:That collapse, following on the heels of disarray in the market for high-risk, high-yield bonds, cast doubt on the entire takeover business, which has fueled both big profits among Wall Street securities firms and big gains in the stock market generally. 
05/wsj_0504:Yesterday's rise in Nekoosa's share price came on volume of 786,700 shares, four times the daily average. 
05/wsj_0504:By contrast, Value Line said Georgia-Pacific "is in a comparatively good position to deal with weakening paper markets," because its production is concentrated not in the Northwest but in the South, where it should be able to avoid some of the cost pressures from rising wood-chip prices.
05/wsj_0504:The purchase of Nekoosa would easily eclipse Georgia-Pacific's $530 million acquisition of Brunswick Pulp & Paper Co. last year.
05/wsj_0504:That acquisition, which also included the assumption of $135 million in debt, was designed to allow Georgia-Pacific to capitalize on the strong demand for softwood pulp, as well as reduce its exposure to the housing market. 
05/wsj_0505:Ratners and Weisfield's said they reached an agreement in principle for the acquisition of Weisfield's by Sterling Inc.
05/wsj_0505:In the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, the company reported sales of $59.5 million and pretax profit of $2.9 million. 
05/wsj_0505:Ratners, which controls 25% of the British jewelry market, would increase the number of its U.S. stores to about 450 stores from 360.
05/wsj_0505:It has said it hopes to control 5% of jewelry business in the U.S. by 1992; currently it controls about 2%. 
05/wsj_0506:Aerojet General Corp., a unit of GenCorp Inc., was awarded a $40.1 million
05/wsj_0506:Beech Aircraft Corp., a unit of Raytheon Co., received an $11.5 million Air Force contract for C-12 aircraft support. 
05/wsj_0507:Analog Devices Inc. said it may purchase as many as one million of its common shares over the next several months. 
05/wsj_0508:John Lehman's editorial-page article on the Pentagon as a haunted house omits the real roots of its ghost population ("In the Pentagon, the Undead Walk," Oct. 18).
05/wsj_0508:The media's treatment of the Defense Department during the Vietnam War, the Carter administration's denigration of the military, and the public scapegoating of Lt. Col. Oliver North have all served to emasculate the poor souls who live there.
05/wsj_0508:Ever since the days of Alfred Thayer Mahan (U.S. naval officer and naval historian) and Teddy Roosevelt the Navy has been the service most favored by Washington officialdom.
05/wsj_0508:Of course these turf battles are unseemly, wasteful and potentially dangerous and should be resolved in the interest of national security, but Mr. Lehman seems to be part of the problem rather than part of the answer. 
05/wsj_0509:Succeeding him as chairman and chief executive will be Frank Lorenzo, chairman and chief executive of Continental's parent, Texas Air Corp. Mr. Lorenzo, 49 years old, is reclaiming the job that was his before Mr. Corr signed on. 
05/wsj_0509:Mr. Foret, 44, is a 15-year veteran of Texas Air and Texas International Airlines, its predecessor.
05/wsj_0509:It's unclear what role, if any, Mr. Lorenzo's recent exploration of a possible sale of a stake in Continental had in Mr. Corr's departure.
05/wsj_0509:During his tenure, Mr. Corr attempted through a series of meetings to inform managers of some of the company's future plans, traveled widely to talk to employees and backed training sessions designed to improve the carrier's image. 
05/wsj_0509:Mr. Foret is one of a handful of executives Mr. Lorenzo has relied on over the years.
05/wsj_0509:Among the other alumni are Stephen Wolf, now chairman of UAL Inc., and Thomas Plaskett, president of Pan Am Corp. 
05/wsj_0511:Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
05/wsj_0512:Charles D. Way, president of this restaurant operator, assumed the additional post of chief executive officer.
05/wsj_0514:Charles A. Pearce, 66 years old, will retire from his post as chief executive officer of this bank holding company effective Dec. 31.
05/wsj_0515:It is a peaceful time in this part of western India.
05/wsj_0515:One could imagine such a lull in the lives of the Arabs before the quadrupling of oil prices.
05/wsj_0515:For just as the Arabs were in the 1960s, the farmers of Sidhpur are on the brink of global power and fame.
05/wsj_0515:That is because Sidhpur has a near-monopoly on the world's supply of flea seed, also known as flea wort or, in Western parlance, psyllium: a tiny, tasteless, obscure seed that, according to early research, may reduce cholesterol levels in the blood.
05/wsj_0515:If further research proves the seed's benefits, this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health-food fad to rival all fads since cod-liver oil. 
05/wsj_0515:"This seed's not grown anywhere else in India, or anywhere else in the world," says T.V. Krishnamurthy, a vice president of Procter & Gamble India Ltd., a major psyllium buyer and promoter. "The proper climatic conditions don't exist in many places in the world." Arvind Patel, a processor and exporter of the seed, raves: "If psyllium takes the place of oat bran, it will be huge." 
05/wsj_0515:Whether psyllium makes Sidhpur's fortune depends on cholesterol-fearing Americans, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, of course, the outcome of further research.
05/wsj_0515:But they have no desire to eat a bowl of psyllium each morning, and, perhaps, little need: lean, frugal vegetarians, the farmers are innocents in the clogged, treacherous world of cholesterol. 
05/wsj_0515:It is the seed's colorlessness and size -- 1,000 of them weigh only 1.5 grams, or about as much as two paper clips -- that explain the historical allusions to fleas.
05/wsj_0515:The transluscent husk of the seed is removed, sifted and crushed; the seed itself is fed to animals.
05/wsj_0515:Some 90% of the crop, which was worth $26 million last year, is exported. 
05/wsj_0515:One of the studies, done at the University of Minnesota, tested 75 people with raised cholesterol levels.
05/wsj_0515:After 16 weeks, the group that took three daily teaspoons of Metamucil saw a significant dip in their general cholesterol levels, and an even larger reduction in levels of low-density lipoproteins, the so-called bad cholesterol.
05/wsj_0515:The flood of claims and counter-claims worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new cereals.
05/wsj_0515:If the FDA approves the new uses of psyllium, other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products. 
05/wsj_0515:"It's going to be a sensational thing," says Mr. Krishnamurthy of P&G in Bombay.
05/wsj_0515:But the news of the boom has yet to trickle down to the farmers.
05/wsj_0515:They only know of one use for the crop, as a laxative, and with psyllium prices currently languishing in the wake of a bumper crop, they think of the seed as a marginal crop, something to grow between summer wheat crops. 
05/wsj_0515:"Psyllium's not a good crop," complains Sooraji Jath, a 26-year-old farmer from the village of Lakshmipura. "You get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined." 
05/wsj_0515:The staff brags about psyllium's hefty contribution to American regularity, without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol.
05/wsj_0515:In one way, the psyllium middlemen -- the buyers and exporters -- are glad to keep news of the boom to themselves.
05/wsj_0515:This is partly due to the particular demands of the crop.
05/wsj_0515:Small crops are grown in Pakistan, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Brazil, but their quality can't compare to that of Indian psyllium. 
05/wsj_0515:Mr. Jath is thinking of passing up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as cumin or fennel. "Maybe I'll plant castor-oil seeds." His brother, Parkhaji, whose head is swathed in a gorgeous crimson turban, nods vigorous assent. 
05/wsj_0515:So when next year's psyllium crop is harvested in March, it may be smaller than the 16,000 metric tons of the past few years -- right at the crest of the psyllium boom. 
05/wsj_0516:Kellwood Co. said it completed a previously announced acquisition of Crowntuft Manufacturing Corp., a New York-based maker of chenille robes and lounge wear. 
05/wsj_0516:The apparel maker wouldn't disclose terms of the agreement.
05/wsj_0516:Kellwood said Gabriel Hakim Sr., president of Crowntuft, will continue to head Crowntuft's management group. 
05/wsj_0518:The reasonable first-year rates can be followed by increases of 60% or more if a covered employee files a major claim, they complain.
05/wsj_0518:Insurance premiums for one small Maryland concern went up 130% in less than two years, the last increase coming after one of its three workers developed a herniated disk. 
05/wsj_0518:"There's a distinct possibility that I may lose my job over this," the employee, Karen Allen, of Floor Covering Resources, Kensington, Md., recently told a congressional hearing.
05/wsj_0518:Surveys repeatedly show that small-business owners rank the availability and rising cost of health insurance as one of their biggest concerns. 
05/wsj_0518:The House Energy and Commerce Committee's health subcommittee, headed by Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California, is looking into complaints that small businesses not only can't keep reasonably priced employee-health insurance if claims are filed, but often can't get coverage at all if a worker is termed medically uninsurable. 
05/wsj_0518:"I have an old-fashioned name for people in that position: sick people who need health insurance," Rep. Waxman says. "What we're seeing now makes a mockery of the idea of insurance: collect premiums from the healthy, dump the sick and let them pay their own bills." Some lawmakers may seek legislation to limit overly restrictive insurance policies. 
05/wsj_0518:The concern grows out of increased efforts by the insurers to woo the small-business market.
05/wsj_0518:"Insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick, but it's a roll of the dice," says Rosemary Heinhold of the Small Business Service Bureau, a group representing 35,000 small businesses nationwide. "One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant, and rates go up 40% to 60%.
05/wsj_0518:Small-business people end up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness." 
05/wsj_0518:In addition, the group says some of its member companies have been denied insurance because individual workers had medical problems that ranged from a mild cardiac condition to psychological counseling after a divorce, hemorrhoids and overweight. 
05/wsj_0518:The Health Insurance Association of America, an insurers' trade group, acknowledges that stiff competition among its members to insure businesses likely to be good risks during the first year of coverage has aggravated the problem in the small-business market.
05/wsj_0518:But it says that rapid rate increases are directly tied to the soaring cost of health care. 
05/wsj_0518:But the general practice makes it more difficult to combine small groups of people into larger groups, thus spreading the risk over a larger base of premiums. 
05/wsj_0518:"I'm not accusing insurers of dereliction of duty," Robert Patricelli of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told Mr. Waxman's panel. "You can't ask one carrier to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the marketplace." 
05/wsj_0518:Rep. Waxman and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts have proposed regulation to deal with the problem.
05/wsj_0518:The proposal is just part of legislation that would require businesses to provide health benefits, an idea that is strongly opposed by small business who say it would just compound the insurance-cost problems. 
05/wsj_0518:But small-business lobbyists say they support the idea, included in the Kennedy-Waxman bill, of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating, which pegs rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group, and is designed to prevent insurance companies from taking only low-risk small companies as clients. 
05/wsj_0518:But first on the list of priorities, says the National Federation of Independent Business, is to prohibit state laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items, such as psychiatric care, in basic health plans.
05/wsj_0518:"Before the state of Wisconsin mandated that mental-health care be covered, there were only 70 mental-health clinics in the state; now there are 400," says Carolyn Miller, an NFIB lobbyist.
05/wsj_0518:The complexities of the insurance problem make the outcome difficult to predict.
05/wsj_0519:The Belgian consumer price index rose a provisional 0.1% in October from the previous month and was up 3.64% from October 1988, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said. 
05/wsj_0519:The index, which uses a base of 1981 as 100, was calculated at 140.91 points in October, from 140.74 in September. 
05/wsj_0520:Nashua Corp., rumored a potential takeover target for six months, said that a Dutch company has sought U.S. approval to buy up to 25% of Nashua's shares. 
05/wsj_0520:Nashua immediately responded by strengthening a poison-pill plan and saying it will buy back up to one million of its shares, or 10.4% of the 9.6 million outstanding. 
05/wsj_0520:Nashua, whose major business is selling copiers, facsimile machines and related supplies, said Reiss & Co. B.V. of the Netherlands filed a request with the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for permission to buy more than $15 million of Nashua's stock but less than 25%. 
05/wsj_0520:Previously, an affiliate of Unicorp Canada disclosed a stake of less than 5% in Nashua, according to Daniel M. Junius, Nashua's treasurer. 
05/wsj_0520:Nashua's stock has fluctuated sharply on takeover speculation, rising to a high for the year of $42.875 a share in June from $29.75 in March.
05/wsj_0520:But the company has had weak results so far this year, with earnings declining 43% to $13.7 million, or $1.43 a share, on a 4% decline in revenue to $713.5 million through the first nine months of the year. 
05/wsj_0520:Its stock has slumped recently, closing unchanged Friday at $29 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange; at that price, the company has a market value of about $278.4 million.
05/wsj_0520:Mr. Junius said Nashua's "intention is to remain an independent public company." The company said it amended its shareholder rights plan by reducing to 10% from 20% the level of ownership by an outsider that would trigger the issuance to other holders of rights to buy additional shares of Nashua common at half price. 
05/wsj_0520:In addition, the company's board authorized the purchase of up to an additional one million shares.
05/wsj_0522:The current account deficit on France's balance of payments narrowed to 1.48 billion French francs ($236.8 million) in August from a revised 2.1 billion francs in July, the Finance Ministry said. 
05/wsj_0522:Previously, the July figure was estimated at a deficit of 613 million francs. 
05/wsj_0522:Seasonally adjusted figures for August weren't available because of a recent strike that has disrupted the ministry's data collection. 
05/wsj_0523:Weisfield's Inc. said it is in preliminary discussions regarding the possible sale of the company. 
05/wsj_0523:A spokesman for the retail jeweler said the company would provide more details today and that it expects to reach a definitive agreement by the end of the week. 
05/wsj_0523:At that price, the company has an indicated value of $42.9 million.
05/wsj_0523:Weisfield's had about 1.1 million shares outstanding as of July 31. 
05/wsj_0524:In the aftermath of the Beijing massacre on June 4, economists advanced wildly divergent views on how Hong Kong would be affected. 
05/wsj_0524:Signs of revival seem evident in Hong Kong's hard-hit hotel sector.
05/wsj_0524:But in the stock and real-estate markets, activity remains spotty even though prices have regained much of their lost ground.
05/wsj_0524:Waning demand reported by importers, retailers and even fancy restaurants all reinforce a profile of a community that is sharply tightening its belt. 
05/wsj_0524:As a model of capitalist efficiency on southern China's doorstep, Hong Kong's prospects look good.
05/wsj_0524:Outflows of people and capital from Hong Kong have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early 1980s.
05/wsj_0524:Maureen Fraser, an economist with W.I. Carr, a subsidiary of France's Banque Indosuez, believes that the territory may not be able to regain its momentum until some time after 1997.
05/wsj_0524:"Investors have to accept the possibility of a significant slowdown in economic activity in the runup to 1997," she says. "Over the next few years, I would advise caution." 
05/wsj_0524:Nearly half of them argue that Hong Kong's uneasy relationship with China will constrain -- though not inhibit -- long-term economic growth.
05/wsj_0524:Since the China crisis erupted, Mr. Mushkat says, the scenario as depicted by the middle-of-the-road group bears a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties Hong Kong currently faces.
05/wsj_0524:The consensus of this group, which he dubs "realists," is that the local economy will grow through the 1990s at annual rates averaging between 3% and 5%. 
05/wsj_0524:Such a pace of growth, though respectable for mature industrialized economies, would be unusually slow for Hong Kong.
05/wsj_0524:The other came in 1974-75 from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock market crash.
05/wsj_0524:"The city could lose some of its entrepreneurial flavor.
05/wsj_0524:It could lose some of its dynamism," says Mr. Mushkat, a director of Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd., a unit of Britain's Barings PLC. "It doesn't have to be a disaster.
05/wsj_0524:Going by official forecasts of GDP, which measures the colony's output of goods and services, minus foreign income, Mr. Mushkat's "realists" seem relatively close to the mark.
05/wsj_0524:After taking into account the fallout from the China crisis, the government has projected 1989 GDP growth of 5%.
05/wsj_0524:The updated forecast, published Aug. 25, compares with an earlier forecast of 6% published March 1 and a 7.4% rate achieved in 
05/wsj_0524:Many factors besides a dread of 1997 will have a bearing on Hong Kong's economy.
05/wsj_0524:Many are refugees, having fled China's unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the Communist Party took power in 1949.
05/wsj_0524:As a result, many of those now planning to leave Hong Kong can't easily be swayed by momentary improvements in the colony's political and economic climate. 
05/wsj_0524:A large number of those leaving are managers and professionals.
05/wsj_0524:While no one professes to know the exact cost of such a "brain drain" to the economy, hardly anyone doubts that it poses a threat. 
05/wsj_0524:"When the economy loses a big portion of its work force that also happens to include its most productive members, economic growth is bound to be affected," says Anthong Wong, an economist with Hang Seng Bank. 
05/wsj_0525:Though the trading halts are offered as a sign of concern about recent stock market volatility, most Wall Street firms remain open to handle program trading for customers.
05/wsj_0525:Trading executives privately say that huge stock-index funds, which dwarf Wall Street firms in terms of the size of their program trades, will continue to launch big programs through the stock market. 
05/wsj_0525:Wells Fargo Investment Advisers, Bankers Trust Co. and Mellon Capital Management are among the top stock-index arbitrage clients of Wall Street, trading executives say.
05/wsj_0525:In fact, without Wall Street firms trading for their own accounts, the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant. "More customers may come to us now," said James Cayne, president of Bear Stearns Cos. 
05/wsj_0525:Executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the 1987 crash.
05/wsj_0525:They noted that studies completed after the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a source of volatility. "The issues that are (now) being raised, in classic anti-intellectual fashion, fly in the face of a number of post-crash studies," said Fred Grauer, chairman of Wells Fargo Investment Advisers. 
05/wsj_0525:Stock-index funds have grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low-cost way to match the performance of the stock market as a whole.
05/wsj_0525:Wells Fargo Investment Advisers, for example, managed $25 billion in stock investments tracking the S&P 500 at the end of June, according to Standard & Poor's Corp. Mr. Grauer said $2 billion of that is used in active index arbitrage. 
05/wsj_0525:Stock-index funds frequently use the futures markets as a hedging tool, but that is a far less aggressive strategy than stock-index arbitrage, in which traders buy and sell big blocks of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from price differences. 
05/wsj_0525:And while signs of an economic slowdown, softer corporate earnings and troubles with takeover financing all have contributed to the stock market's recent weakness, many investors rushed to blame program trading for aggravating market swings. 
05/wsj_0525:Morgan Stanley has consistently been one of the top stock-index arbitrage traders in recent months. 
05/wsj_0525:Indeed, Morgan Stanley's president, Richard B. Fisher, said the firm is putting up money to form a group of regulators, investors and investment banks to find out if stock-index arbitrage artificially induces stock-market volatility. 
05/wsj_0525:Joining the call for some kind of study or regulatory action, Merrill Lynch & Co. recommended program-trading reforms late Friday, including higher margins on stock-index futures and greater regulatory coordination.
05/wsj_0525:Separately, Mr. Cayne of Bear Stearns said his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to "enhance stabilization." Margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security.
05/wsj_0525:These rules, they say, permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks, which frequently knocks the two markets out of line. 
05/wsj_0525:But unequal trading rules allow the futures market to trade differently from stocks, which invites frequent bouts of stock-index arbitrage in the first place. 
05/wsj_0525:"There has to be better coordination on a regulatory basis," said Christopher Pedersen, director of trading at Twenty-First Securities Corp. "One agency should have the authority over all equity products." 
05/wsj_0526:Like so many trends in the entertainment industry, the current spate of rape dramas on television seems to represent a confluence of high-mindedness and self-interest.
05/wsj_0526:The former comes from the latest wave of political activism in Hollywood, especially around feminist issues such as abortion.
05/wsj_0526:The latter comes from the perception, on the part of many people in network TV, that their only hope of keeping viewers from defecting to cable is to fill the airwaves with an increasingly raw sensationalism.
05/wsj_0526:The best of the crop was last week's season premiere of "In the Heat of the Night," the NBC series based on a 1967 feature film about a black Philadelphia police detective in a small Southern town.
05/wsj_0526:Because the show has acquired a sense of place by being filmed on location in Georgia, this episode -- in which Althea gets raped by an arrogant white schoolteacher -- does a decent job of tracing the social repercussions of the crime. 
05/wsj_0526:Obviously, it's harder to establish a sense of place in a one-shot TV movie.
05/wsj_0526:This tale of a Chicago policewoman returning home to find the man who raped her 20 years earlier is supposed to be set in the Ozarks.
05/wsj_0526:But it's more like an illustration of what Ben Stein describes in his study of social attitudes in the TV industry: "Fear of violence and animosity . . . because of race or religion, fear and lack of comprehension about the politics of small-town people . . . produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of TV writers and producers." 
05/wsj_0526:The writer and executive producer of "Settle the Score," Steve Sohmer, is a graduate of Yale who participated in a PBS documentary, aired this summer, in which six members of the Yale class of 1963 ruminated about their lives since graduation.
05/wsj_0526:At one point in the documentary, Mr. Sohmer, who is Jewish, says he felt rejected by many of the Protestants and Southerners he met at Yale.
05/wsj_0526:He quotes one student saying, "You're just the kind of Jewboy we Southerners can't stand." Mr. Sohmer confesses that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now "a dweller on one of the two islands off the coast of America." But is exile in Hollywood enough?
05/wsj_0526:Not to judge by "Settle the Score," in which Mr. Sohmer seems to be settling a score of his own.
05/wsj_0526:Of all the unflattering portraits of small-town America I've seen on TV, this film is the most gratuitously nasty.
05/wsj_0526:The sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter Kate (Jaclyn Smith), and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk, a truly benighted pack of Southern Protestants whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex. 
05/wsj_0526:Her Pa (Howard Duff) is the kind of guy who, while saying grace at the supper table, pauses at the word "sin" and glares at the daughter he hasn't seen for two decades, because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the cold-storage room, and has been indulging the same taste ever since in the fleshpots of Chicago. 
05/wsj_0526:People like Pa do exist, of course.
05/wsj_0526:But in Mr. Sohmer's Ozarks, he is but the tip of the patriarchal iceberg.
05/wsj_0526:Add the fact that any one of them, including Pa, could be her attacker, and you have a setting that doesn't resemble small-town America, or even Hollywood's nightmare of small-town America, so much as a paranoid feminist dystopia like Margaret Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale," itself soon to be (you guessed it) a Hollywood movie. 
05/wsj_0526:Josh makes clumsy passes at Kate when she's seething with anger and fear, but we know from the outset that he's not a member of the evil patriarchy.
05/wsj_0526:He's the director of the local Planned Parenthood chapter.
05/wsj_0526:Her sister-in-law (Amy Wright) is a sniveling prude afraid that Kate will seduce all the married men in town, including a particularly loathsome fellow named Tucker, whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home tending to her bruises and cigarette burns, while he bullies Kate into a dance that consists of drooling on her while trying to break her ribs.
05/wsj_0526:At the very least, it would appear that Sis is a poor judge of masculine charm. 
05/wsj_0526:Yet even these insulting caricatures are not as bad as the moral hypocrisy at the heart of "Settle the Score." In the aforementioned episode of "In the Heat of the Night," we saw Althea being attacked, but we weren't invited to enjoy the spectacle.
05/wsj_0526:In Mr. Sohmer's film, by contrast, we are urged to share the perverse excitement of the rapist creeping up on his victim, as the camera ogles Kate in various stages of undress and lingers on the sight of her trussed-up body during frequent flashbacks to the rape. 
05/wsj_0526:With friends like Mr. Sohmer, do the feminists of Hollywood need enemies? 
05/wsj_0527:Crossland Savings Bank's stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because Crossland may not meet the new government capital criteria effective Dec. 7. 
05/wsj_0527:A spokesman said the savings bank may not qualify for the capital requirements because, under the proposed guidelines, its $380 million of preferred stock doesn't meet the "core capital" criteria outlined under the new Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989.
05/wsj_0527:Additionally, Crossland reported a third-quarter loss of $175.5 million, or $13.44 a share, compared with net income of $27.1 million, or $1.16 a share, a year ago.
05/wsj_0527:A major factor in the third-quarter loss was the write-down of $143.6 million of goodwill. 
05/wsj_0527:The spokesman said that the proposed guidelines caused Crossland to revise its business objectives and, consequently, to write down the asset value of some previous acquisitions.
05/wsj_0527:It also placed on CreditWatch for possible downgrade other securities, including the double-B-minus/B rating of Crossland's certificates of deposit and the single-B rating of its senior subordinated capital notes.
05/wsj_0527:About $518 million of debt is affected. 
05/wsj_0528:Is he a victim of Gramm-Rudman cuts?
05/wsj_0528:ABC hasn't had much luck with shows featuring blacks in recent years, and the producers of one new arrival are a bit desperate. "Homeroom," a show about a black ad executive who gives up the boardroom for a fourth-grade classroom, is flunking the ratings test.
05/wsj_0528:So producers Alyce and Topper Carew spun their Rolodexes and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct-mail campaign.
05/wsj_0528:But employing this kind of gut-wrenching plea to black consciousness makes it even more unusual.
05/wsj_0528:Still, Mr. Carew thinks he can reach a good chunk of the three million-plus black homes he needs by mailing to the almost 10,000 blacks who form what he calls "the grapevine." 
05/wsj_0528:"The grapevine isn't organized, but you and I know it exists," says Mr. Carew, referring to the often uncannily small world of black professionals and community leaders. 
05/wsj_0528:ABC says it is aware of the producers' action, but the mailing was sent without the network's blessing.
05/wsj_0528:Meanwhile, as the Sunday evening show struggles to stay afloat against the tough competition of "Murder, She Wrote," the grapevine idea is threatening to turn into a weed: The tactic apparently has inspired sample viewings, but accolades are slow in coming. 
05/wsj_0528:Some shows just don't impress, he says, and this is one of them. 
05/wsj_0529:Gerald Maier, president and chief executive officer of the natural-gas pipeline and marketing concern, said the company's future growth is "increasingly linked" to decisions made by Calgary-based gas producers. 
05/wsj_0529:"Since deregulation of the market in 1985, producers have become much more intensely involved in both transportation and marketing," Mr. Maier said. "It's a matter of being close to those suppliers; many of those companies don't know us as well as they should." 
05/wsj_0529:That includes all the gas consumed in Ontario and Quebec, along with the bulk of Canadian gas exports to the 
05/wsj_0529:Walter Litvinchuk, vice president of Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd., a Calgary-based gas marketing concern, said the industry will welcome the move. 
05/wsj_0529:"Having more than a token presence here should enhance communications and business relationships," Mr. Litvinchuk said. "Since the cost of transporting gas is so important to producers' ability to sell it, it helps to have input and access to transportation companies." 
05/wsj_0529:Part of both the costs and the savings could be passed on to shippers on the TransCanada pipeline through tolls, which are based on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of operating it. 
05/wsj_0530:Since its founding in 1818, Brooks Brothers, the standard-bearer of the Ivy League look, has eschewed flashy sales promotions and fashion trends -- the rules that most retailers live by.
05/wsj_0530:So two weeks ago, thousands of Brooks Brothers charge customers -- customers conditioned to wait for twice-yearly clearance sales -- got a surprise: an invitation to come in and buy any one item for 25% off.
05/wsj_0530:Departing from its newspaper ads featuring prim sketches of a suit or a coat, Brooks Brothers is marketing an updated image in a new campaign that carries the slogan, "The Surprise of Brooks Brothers." One color photo displays a rainbow of dress shirts tied in a knot; another picture shows neckties with bold designs.
05/wsj_0530:As part of its national ad pitch, Brooks Brothers will show less preppy women's clothes, moving away from its floppy-tie business stereotype.
05/wsj_0530:Brooks Brothers hopes that shaking its time-honored traditions will attract more young men and more women and change consumer perceptions about its range of merchandise. "We have men who only buy their shirts and underwear here or younger customers who only buy their {job} interview suit here," says William Roberti, chairman and chief executive officer of Brooks Brothers. "We want them to buy more of their wardrobe here." Industry watchers agree that Brooks Brothers is long overdue in updating its buttoned-down image, which has stunted its growth.
05/wsj_0530:When acquired in May 1988 by British retailer Marks & Spencer PLC, Brooks Brothers' annual operating profit was about $41.8 million on sales of $290.1 million.
05/wsj_0530:Mr. Roberti concedes that since the $750 million takeover, "sales growth hasn't been dramatic." For the 11 months ended March 31, operating profit at the 52-store chain totaled $40.5 million on sales of $286.8 million. 
05/wsj_0530:Many clothiers, especially Ralph Lauren, have cashed in on the recent popularity of updated Ivy League and English styles.
05/wsj_0530:"Brooks Brothers no longer has a lock on the {Ivy League} customer who is status-conscious about his clothes," says Charlie Davidson, president of the Andover Shop, a traditional men's store in Cambridge, Mass. 
05/wsj_0530:Brooks Brothers' aim is for 20% of total sales to come from the women's department, up from the current 12%. 
05/wsj_0530:Alan Smith, president of Marks & Spencer North America and Far East, says that Brooks Brothers' focus is to boost sales by broadening its merchandise assortment while keeping its "traditional emphasis." The British parent is also streamlining: Brooks Brothers, which continues to make almost all of its merchandise, recently shut one of its two shirt plants in Paterson, N.J., and has closed boys' departments in all but 20 stores. 
05/wsj_0530:More shirts and sweaters will be laid out on tables, instead of sitting behind glass cases, so that customers can "walk up and touch them," Mr. Roberti says. 
05/wsj_0530:Because the biggest growth in menswear is in casual sportswear, Brooks Brothers is chasing more of that business.
05/wsj_0530:The entire second floor of its Madison Avenue store is now casual sportswear featuring items such as ski sweaters, leather backpacks and a $42 wool baseball hat with the store's crest. 
05/wsj_0530:The centerpiece of the overhaul, according to Mr. Roberti, is the men's tailored clothing department, where Brooks Brothers has added new suit styles and fabrics. "The perception out there is that we are very conservative and we only sell one type of suit," Mr. Roberti says, referring to Brooks Brothers' signature three-button "sack suit," with a center-vented jacket and boxy fit. 
05/wsj_0530:Next spring, nearly 30% of its suits will have pleated pants, compared with virtually none a couple of years ago. 
05/wsj_0531:The maker of chemical and industrial materials didn't say how much it would pay or when it would make the transactions. 
05/wsj_0531:Ferro also said it would cancel the unused portion of a 1987 buy-back plan for administrative reasons.
05/wsj_0532:Arthur Price abruptly quit as president and chief executive officer of MTM Entertainment Inc., a Los Angeles production company that has fallen on hard times. 
05/wsj_0532:Mr. Price, 61 years old, also stepped down from the board of TVS Entertainment PLC, the British TV company that last year bought MTM, producer of such TV programs as "Hill Street Blues" and "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." 
05/wsj_0532:Mr. Price "wanted to run the MTM business" and may have regretted selling the company to TVS, suggested Charles Denton, managing director of Zenith Productions, a subsidiary of Carlton Communications PLC, London. 
05/wsj_0532:The $320 million purchase of MTM represented an audacious international move for TVS, which then was about half the U.S. concern's size.
05/wsj_0532:Mr. Gatward has spent a lot of time since late September at MTM's headquarters; he eliminated three departments and fired six executives, according to the TVS spokesman.
05/wsj_0532:TVS blames difficulties in peddling reruns of MTM shows to U.S. broadcasters for the problems at MTM.
05/wsj_0532:Mr. Tinker later left to become chairman of National Broadcasting Co.
05/wsj_0532:The TVS spokesman said Mr. Price still holds about an 8% TVS stake, acquired as part of the MTM acquisition.
05/wsj_0533:Merieux officials said last week that they are "highly confident" the offer will be approved once it submits details of its proposed investments to federal regulators. 
05/wsj_0533:Both offers are conditional on regulatory approvals and enough shares being tendered to give the bidders a majority of Connaught's shares outstanding. 
05/wsj_0533:Institut Merieux, which already holds a 12.5% stake in Connaught, said that at the close of business Thursday, 5,745,188 shares of Connaught and C$44.3 million face amount of debentures, convertible into 1,826,596 common shares, had been tendered to its offer.
05/wsj_0533:At the close of business Thursday, Ciba-Geigy and Chiron said 11,580 common shares had been tendered to their offer.
05/wsj_0533:Separately, the Ontario Supreme Court said it will postpone indefinitely a ruling on the lawsuit launched by the University of Toronto against Connaught in connection with the Merieux bid. 
05/wsj_0533:In a statement prepared by lawyers for the university and Connaught, the parties said they agreed that as a result of reaching a C415 million research accord, "It is unnecessary that there be a judgment on the merits {of the case} at this time." 
05/wsj_0534:Conseco Inc. said it is calling for the redemption on Dec. 7 of all the 800,000 remaining shares outstanding of its $1.875 Series A convertible preferred stock at $26.805 a share. 
05/wsj_0534:Until then, Conseco said the stock remains convertible into common stock at the rate of 1.439 shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $17.50 a common share.
05/wsj_0535:Centerior Energy Corp. said the Ohio Water Development Authority approved terms for two series of tax-exempt bonds to finance a water-pollution control and solid-waste disposal facilities. 
05/wsj_0535:The authority will issue a total of $446.5 million of pollution-control revenue bonds.
05/wsj_0535:Proceeds of the sale will go to Centerior's operating subsidiaries to finance the projects, located at a nuclear unit located near Cleveland. 
05/wsj_0535:The bonds will be issued for a term of 34 years at an interest rate of 8%.
05/wsj_0536:The program, which runs through Jan. 4, also offers low-rate financing in lieu of the cash rebate. 
05/wsj_0537:After days of intense but fruitless negotiations, a federal judge last week threatened to convert William Herbert Hunt's Chapter 11 personal bankruptcy case into a Chapter 7 liquidation. 
05/wsj_0537:If the case is converted to Chapter 7, what remains of the oil tycoon's once-vast estate -- now believed to have a value of less than $125 million -- would be sold off quickly with most of the proceeds going to the Internal Revenue Service, whose claim for $300 million in back taxes has priority in the case.
05/wsj_0537:Hundreds of smaller creditors could get nothing, according to attorneys involved. 
05/wsj_0537:While admitting such a move would be "devastating" to most creditors, Judge Abramson told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on Mr. Hunt's shrinking estate and about the fact that, following voting by creditors, none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form. 
05/wsj_0537:Under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, a company continues to operate under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts.
05/wsj_0537:Under Chapter 7, the assets of a company are sold off to pay creditors. 
05/wsj_0537:The Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit, which is seeking repayment of a $36 million loan, has asked the court to give its claim priority over that of Minpeco, which won a $132 million judgment against Mr. Hunt, his brother Nelson Bunker Hunt and other defendants last year in a case stemming from their alleged attempts to corner the silver market in 
05/wsj_0537:While claiming that penalties, legal fees and interest have driven the value of its claim to more than $250 million, Minpeco has agreed to settle for an allowed claim of as much as $65.7 million.
05/wsj_0537:Neither plan is dead, however, and the judge could force creditors to accept some version of them after ruling on the Minpeco-Manufacturers Hanover dispute. 
05/wsj_0538:Stuart E. Eizenstat, a partner in the Washington law firm of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy, was named a director of this utility holding company, increasing board membership to 14. 
05/wsj_0539:Pacific First Financial Corp. said it signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire the construction lending unit of Old Stone Bank of California. 
05/wsj_0540:General Electric Co. 's rail-car leasing unit completed the $178.5 million purchase of similar businesses from Leucadia National Corp. and Brae Corp., 74%-owned by Leucadia, the sellers said. 
05/wsj_0540:The buyer was GE Capital Railcar Services, Chicago, a major owner of railway equipment and part of the GE Capital operations. 
05/wsj_0540:Leucadia, New York, estimated it had a pre-tax gain on the transaction of $57 million, including its part of Brae's gain.
05/wsj_0540:Because of tax-loss carry-forward, Leucadia said it expects to escape taxes on "a substantial portion of the gain." 
05/wsj_0540:The estimated gain for Brae is $15 million, including a tax credit of $7 million, the sellers said. "The credit for income taxes is a result of having provided deferred income taxes applicable to the sold assets at the higher income tax rates in effect in prior years," the sellers said. 
05/wsj_0541:Automatic Data Processing Inc. plans to redeem on Nov. 16 its $150 million of 6.5% convertible subordinated debentures due March 1, 2011. 
05/wsj_0541:The computing-services concern will pay $1,059.04 for each $1,000 face amount of debt.
05/wsj_0541:Automatic Data is redeeming the bonds because the after-tax cost of the interest on the bonds is higher than the dividend yield on the common, a spokesman said. 
05/wsj_0542:Dow Jones & Co. extended its tender offer of $18 a share, or about $576 million, for the 33% of Telerate Inc. that it doesn't already own until 5 p.m. EST, Nov. 6. 
05/wsj_0542:The supplement contains various information that has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission since Dow Jones launched the offer on Sept. 26, but it doesn't change the terms and conditions of the offer except to extend its expiration date. 
05/wsj_0542:In Delaware Chancery Court litigation, Telerate has criticized Dow Jones for not disclosing that Telerate's management expects the company's revenue to increase by 20% annually, while Dow Jones based its projections of Telerate's performance on a 12% revenue growth forecast.
05/wsj_0542:In the tender offer supplement, Dow Jones discloses the different growth forecasts but says it views the 20% growth rate "as a hoped-for goal" of Telerate's management "and not as a realistic basis on which to project the company's likely future performance." 
05/wsj_0542:Late last week, representatives of Dow Jones and Telerate began negotiations about the terms of the offer, but those talks didn't result in any changes in the offer. 
05/wsj_0542:Dow Jones, which owns 67% of Telerate, publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine, community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases. 
05/wsj_0544:Air & Water Technologies Corp. completed the acquisition of Falcon Associates Inc., a Bristol, Pa., asbestos-abatement concern, for $25 million of stock. 
05/wsj_0544:Air & Water, which provides environmental services and systems, paid about 1.4 million of its shares for Falcon.
05/wsj_0546:Upset over the use of what it says are its exclusive trademarks, Hells Angels Motorcycle Corp. is fighting back -- in court.
05/wsj_0546:Concord New Horizons Corp., creators of a 1988 movie called Nam Angels, used the gang's name and trademarks without authorization, the not-for-profit corporation says in a complaint filed in federal court. 
05/wsj_0546:Nam Angels depicts a group of the cycle gang's members on a mercenary mission to Viet Nam during the war years. 
05/wsj_0546:Also named in the suit is Media Home Entertainment Inc. of Culver City, Calif., its parent, Heron Communications Inc., and Broadstar Television of Los Angeles, holders of the copyright on the movie. 
05/wsj_0546:Besides being upset with the film's use of the Hells Angels name and logos, the Angels are angry with their depiction in the movie. 
05/wsj_0546:"There is absolutely no way our board or membership would have approved the portrayal of the Hells Angels in this movie," said George Christie, president of the club's Ventura chapter. "Portrayal of our members as disloyal to each other is totally contrary to the most important values of our organization -- loyalty and trust." 
05/wsj_0546:Both of these actions aren't characteristic of real Hells Angels, Mr. Christie said. 
05/wsj_0547:Douglas H. Miller, self-employed in the oil and gas securities business, was named chairman of this oil and gas exploration company, filling a vacancy.
05/wsj_0548:Lawrence M. Gressette Jr., president, was elected to the additional posts of chairman and chief executive officer of this utility holding company, effective Feb. 1, 1990.
05/wsj_0548:The 57-year-old Mr. Gressette, who was also elected chairman and chief executive of all Scana subsidiaries, succeeds John A. Warren.
05/wsj_0550:The world had a big yuk recently when the Soviets reported a rash of UFO landings, one of them bringing tall aliens who glowed in the dark to Voronezh.
05/wsj_0550:It is the opinion of Timothy Good, author of "Above Top Secret: The World UFO Cover-Up" (Quill/William Morrow, 592 pages, $12.95), that the world laughs too fast. 
05/wsj_0550:Here is a bible for UFO watchers, complete with pictures of people who say they've had personal relationships with aliens.
05/wsj_0550:One photo shows a woman sporting a scar she says was made by a laser beam (a low-caliber weapon, from the looks of the wound). 
05/wsj_0550:Mr. Good devotes much serious space to the events of Feb. 25, 1942, when American gunners spotted strange lights in the sky above Los Angeles.
05/wsj_0550:Ground batteries, targeting an odd assortment of aircraft traveling at highly unusual speeds, opened up a furious fusillade.
05/wsj_0550:The sky filled with 12.8-pound shells, several of which fell back to Earth, destroying homes and buildings.
05/wsj_0550:Mr. Good, who documents these things as best he can, provides an official explanation in the form of a memorandum from Chief of Staff George C. Marshall to President Roosevelt: "1,430 pounds of ammunition," he wrote his commander in chief, were expended on "unidentified aircraft," flying at speeds as slow as 200 mph and elevations between 9,000 and 18,000 feet. 
05/wsj_0550:Well, thousands of Californians on the scene insisted the ammo had been uselessly aimed at a large, hardy UFO, but you will just have to make your own decision about such sightings.
05/wsj_0550:One thing's for sure: There have been a ton of them, and greater beings than the editors of the National Enquirer have shown interest.
05/wsj_0550:Gerald Ford, a fairly down-to-earth fellow, once sent a letter to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee recommending that "there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomenon.
05/wsj_0550:Jimmy Carter went further in a 1976 campaign promise: "If I become president, I'll make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public, and the scientists.
05/wsj_0550:Now why, you have to ask yourself, would intelligent beings haul a bunch of rocks around the universe?
05/wsj_0550:Speculation as to the nature of aliens will no doubt continue until we wake up one morning to find they've taken over "The Today Show," the way they overwhelm an entire town in Jack Finney's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (Fireside/Simon & Schuster, 216 pages, $8.95).
05/wsj_0550:Maybe some of our talk-show hosts and anchors have already been taken over?
05/wsj_0550:The point of this 1955 novel, which spawned two movies, is that the soulless pod people replicated by alien plants are virtually indistinguishable from human folks. 
05/wsj_0550:He even had sex with one -- sort of, and not intentionally -- as readers learned in his "Communion" (a book recently described in the New York Times as a "nonfiction best seller"). 
05/wsj_0550:The way Mr. Strieber tells it in his earnest prose, the intelligence officer who found the craft's strange debris was forced by the government to call the flower-inscribed scraps parts of a weather balloon.
05/wsj_0550:The apparent crash became top secret, and the alien creatures went away upset with the rude ways of human beings.
05/wsj_0550:We lost our chance to communicate with sweet-natured visitors "about four feet tall {who} looked as though they were made of puffed-up marshmallow." 
05/wsj_0551:Trustcorp Inc. will become Society Bank & Trust when its merger is completed with Society Corp. of Cleveland, the bank said. 
05/wsj_0551:Society Corp., which is also a bank, agreed in June to buy Trustcorp for 12.4 million shares of stock with a market value of about $450 million.
05/wsj_0552:When the economy stumbled in the mid-1970s, Akzo NV fell out of bed. 
05/wsj_0552:Towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business, which accounted for half of the Dutch chemical company's sales, led to huge losses and left Akzo's survival in doubt.
05/wsj_0552:During the same period, the company has sold about 1.6 billion guilders of assets. 
05/wsj_0552:The fibers business, whose products go into textiles, carpeting and myriad industrial uses, now accounts for only 20% of Akzo's sales. "We have definitely become less cyclical," Syb Bergsma, executive vice president-finance, said in an interview. 
05/wsj_0552:An indication of Akzo's success in reshaping itself will come Thursday when it reports third-quarter results.
05/wsj_0552:Analysts expect the company to show profit of about 225 million guilders, up 9% from 206.3 million guilders a year earlier. 
05/wsj_0552:He figures Akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year.
05/wsj_0552:The bank projects Akzo will show per-share earnings of 24 guilders in 1990, up from an estimated 22.5 guilders for this year and the 20.9 guilders reported for 1988. 
05/wsj_0552:At James Capel & Co. in London, analyst Jackie Ashurst notes that Akzo is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products.
05/wsj_0552:Thus, while Akzo profited less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics, it has less to fear from the current slump. 
05/wsj_0552:A decline may come in the first half of 1990, he said, but the market doesn't appear on the verge of a severe downturn. 
05/wsj_0552:To reduce the danger of such pricing cycles, Akzo has invested heavily in specialty chemicals, which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk chemicals.
05/wsj_0552:Akzo's biggest move in this area was the 1987 acquisition of Stauffer Chemical Co. 's specialty chemical business for $625 million. 
05/wsj_0552:In a less glamorous field, Akzo is the world's biggest producer of industrial salt, used as a raw material for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as melting ice.
05/wsj_0552:In the fibers division, profit remains weak, largely because of persistent overcapacity.
05/wsj_0552:Mr. Bergsma said world-wide industry sales of aramid fibers are expected to total about $500 million this year.
05/wsj_0552:Sales growth of 10% a year seems possible, he said, and Akzo expects its Twaron business to become profitable in 1990. 
05/wsj_0552:In August, for example, it completed the $110 million acquisition of Reliance Universal Inc., a U.S. maker of industrial coatings for wood, metals and plastics, from Tyler Corp. Mr. Bergsma said Akzo is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale. 
05/wsj_0552:Akzo is the leading seller of birth-control pills in Europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the U.S. and Japan.
05/wsj_0553:He is a politician with the courage of true conviction, as in summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to 40%.
05/wsj_0553:But in the end his resignation as Chancellor of the Exchequer may be a good thing, especially if it works as he no doubt intends -- by forcing Prime Minister Thatcher and her counterparts elsewhere to confront the genuine intellectual issues involved. 
05/wsj_0553:The Fleet Street reaction was captured in the Guardian headline, "Departure Reveals Thatcher Poison." British politicians divide into two groups of chickens, those with their necks cut and those screaming the sky is falling.
05/wsj_0553:So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues: Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan Walters, the counterpoint of the Chancellor's difficulties, who also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher. 
05/wsj_0553:The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates, conservative, free-market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps.
05/wsj_0553:There are the supply-side globalists, who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates.
05/wsj_0553:To make matters even more confusing, the earlier U.S. experience made clear that Mr. Lawson's tax cuts would have profound effects on Britain's international accounts and the value of sterling.
05/wsj_0553:They increased the after-tax rate of return and made Britain a far more attractive place to invest, producing sudden capital inflows.
05/wsj_0553:Or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate, as the Chancellor argued, and ensure the permanence of this policy by joining the EMS. 
05/wsj_0553:Faced with a similar situation, Paul Volcker let the dollar soar, (though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly monetarists issued egg-on-the-face warnings of inflation).
05/wsj_0553:But this devastated the U.S. manufacturing sector, laying the seeds of protectionism.
05/wsj_0553:So the British experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of Albion.
05/wsj_0553:We had been soliciting opinions on it long before Mr. Lawson's resignation, and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy, John Major.
05/wsj_0553:In pursuit of this mystery, Keynesian adepts and twin-deficit mavens need not apply. 
05/wsj_0553:We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience.
05/wsj_0553:Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates, though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound, not restrain a strong one.
05/wsj_0553:We recall that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling, but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise.
05/wsj_0553:In fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial, for example, and perhaps he picked the wrong pound-DM rate.
05/wsj_0553:We sympathize with Mrs. Thatcher's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of West Germany.
05/wsj_0553:Alan Reynolds of Polyconomics adds his suspicion that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus.
05/wsj_0553:Those who can shake Keynesian ghosts out of their heads might recognize that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open-market operation, indeed, it is the definition of an open market operation to expand the money supply.
05/wsj_0553:In the end, neither policy was followed, and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery.
05/wsj_0553:This cannot be solved by provoking a further downturn; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation.
05/wsj_0553:This was the version of supply-side economics that, in the late 1970s and early '80s, worked in America and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts Britain today. 
05/wsj_0554:The ad agency's pretax profit margins were slightly under 10% at the time of the takeover, according to analysts; London-based WPP's goal is to increase margins to 12%. 
05/wsj_0554:Surrounded by stacks of paper, two computers and photos of himself boating and flying, Mr. Phillips laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency. 
05/wsj_0554:Ogilvy under the fastidious Mr. Roman gained a reputation as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of clients, of preaching what strategy a client should -- indeed, must -- follow.
05/wsj_0554:And some of its top client-service executives, including Mr. Phillips, were promoted to the point they were saddled with administrative duties, with little time to see clients. 
05/wsj_0554:But Mr. Phillips recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by delegating much of his administrative work to a deputy.
05/wsj_0554:The two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins. "Clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business -- not once a month, but two or three times a week," he said. 
05/wsj_0554:Under the reorganization, Ogilvy plans to name one executive on each account as a "client service director" to work as the client's single contact for all those services. "There is little or no integration of our work, quality is spotty, there is no single focus," Mr. Phillips complained to staffers in March, when the reorganization was announced.
05/wsj_0554:And while last week the agency hired a top Chiat/Day/Mojo executive, Bill Hamilton, to try to bolster its work, "Graham has to get the revenue of that New York office moving," says James Dougherty, an analyst with County NatWest Securities. 
05/wsj_0554:As Mr. Dougherty says, "The last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top . . . and Graham is obviously a long-term member of the Ogilvy Mafia, as we call it." 
05/wsj_0554:WPP, which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands-on way, instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in Ogilvy's new headquarters building to outsiders.
05/wsj_0554:The fact that the agency will now be part of a U.K. company, under British accounting rules, will also make the profit picture look better. 
05/wsj_0554:Arthur Klein, president of Young & Rubicam's New York office, stepped down "temporarily" in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in New Haven, Conn., that he, the agency and another top executive bribed Jamaican tourist officials to win its account in 1981. 
05/wsj_0554:In an internal memo, Alex Kroll, the agency's chairman, said Mr. Klein decided to remove himself to minimize "negative reaction" from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense. "The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on Y&R," Mr. Kroll wrote.
05/wsj_0554:He said Mr. Klein will return to his post at the end of the trial "at which he will be vindicated." 
05/wsj_0554:Mr. Klein will work with Mr. Kroll on some of the agency's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending.
05/wsj_0554:Peter Georgescu, president of Y&R's ad operations, will assume Mr. Klein's day-to-day role. 
05/wsj_0554:Ms. Heller, 38, had headed up Boston agency Heller/Breene, a unit of WCRS.
05/wsj_0554:The agency, with about $35 million in billings, will be dissolved, with some of its staffers absorbed by WCRS's Della Femina McNamee unit in Boston, Ms. Heller said.
05/wsj_0554:Wells Rich declined to comment on the status of the account, as did the other agencies. 
05/wsj_0555:Waxman Industries Inc. said holders of $6,542,000 face amount of its 6 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures, due March 15, 2007, have elected to convert the debt into about 683,000 common shares. 
05/wsj_0555:The company said the holders represent 52% of the face amount of the debentures. 
05/wsj_0555:Waxman sells a variety of hardware products for the home repair market. 
05/wsj_0556:The net loss for the quarter was $43.1 million against a year-earlier loss of $106 million.
05/wsj_0556:The loss in the fourth quarter of 1988 reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for Federated Department Stores Inc., as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations. 
05/wsj_0556:Sales for both years reflect 12-month performances for each year of I. Magnin, Bullock's, and Bullocks Wilshire.
05/wsj_0556:Macy reported a net loss for fiscal 1989 of $53.7 million compared with a net loss of $188.2 million for fiscal 1988. 
05/wsj_0556:The company's earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, which bondholders use a measurement of the chain's ability to pay its existing debt, increased 11% in fiscal 1989 to $926.1 million from $833.6 million.
05/wsj_0556:As of Feb. 1, 1990, the Bullocks Wilshire stores will operate as I. Magnin stores.
05/wsj_0556:Although management led a leveraged buy-out of R.H. Macy in July 1986, the company still makes financial filings because of its publicly traded debt.
05/wsj_0556:This includes $4.6 billion of long-term debt, $457.5 million in short-term debt, and $95.7 million of the current portion of long-term debt. 
05/wsj_0556:In a letter to investors, Chairman Edward S. Finkelstein wrote that he expects the company to "benefit from some of the disruption faced by our competitors.
05/wsj_0556:Mr. Finkelstein flew to San Francisco the day after the earthquake, and found that 10 to 12 of his company's stores had sustained some damage, including the breakage of most windows at the I. Magnin store on Union Square. 
05/wsj_0557:The sale, at a higher price than some analysts had expected, helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and boosts Nestle's 7% share of the U.S. candy market to about 12%. 
05/wsj_0557:The candy businesses had sales of about $154 million last year, which was roughly 12% of total revenue for RJR's Planters LifeSavers unit, according to a memorandum distributed by RJR's owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., to bankers last December. 
05/wsj_0557:The sale, which had been expected, is part of KKR's program to pay down $5 billion of a $6 billion bridge loan by February.
05/wsj_0557:Roughly $2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales, and RJR expects to use another $2 billion from the pending, two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit.
05/wsj_0557:Louis Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based RJR, called the sale a "significant step" in the company's divestiture program, as well as a "a strategic divestiture." Since KKR bought RJR in February for $25 billion of debt, it has agreed to sell nearly $5 billion of RJR assets.
05/wsj_0557:Baby Ruth and Butterfinger are both among the top-selling 15 chocolate bars in the U.S., but RJR's overall share of the roughly $5.1 billion market is less than 5%.
05/wsj_0557:Nestle's share of 7% before Friday's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders Hershey Foods Corp. and Mars Inc., which have about 40% and 36% of the market, respectively. 
05/wsj_0557:"This means Nestle is now in the candybar business in a big way," said Lisbeth Echeandia, publisher of Orlando, Fla.-based Confectioner Magazine. "For them, it makes all kinds of sense.
05/wsj_0557:The new candy bars, "make an important contribution to our Nestle Foods commitment to this very important strategic unit," said C. Alan MacDonald, president of Nestle Foods in Purchase, N.Y. 
05/wsj_0558:Aetna Life & Casualty Co. 's third-quarter net income fell 22% to $182.6 million, or $1.63 a share, reflecting the damages from Hurricane Hugo and lower results for some of the company's major divisions. 
05/wsj_0558:But because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming in more slowly, the company has no estimate of the impact of the earthquake on fourth-quarter results. 
05/wsj_0558:In the latest quarter, Aetna had a $23 million loss on its auto/homeowners line, compared with earnings of $33 million last year.
05/wsj_0558:Third-quarter results included net realized capital gains of $48 million, which included $27 million from the sale of Federated Investors in August and a $15 million tax credit. 
05/wsj_0559:Out of the mouths of revolutionaries are coming words of moderation. 
05/wsj_0559:Here, at a soccer stadium near the black township of Soweto yesterday, were eight leaders of the African National Congress, seven of whom had spent most of their adult lives in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.
05/wsj_0559:Here was the state security appartus poised to pounce on any words or acts of provocation, let alone revolution. 
05/wsj_0559:But the words that boomed over the loudspeakers bore messages of peace, unity, negotiation and discipline. "We stand for peace today and we will stand for peace tomorrow," said Walter Sisulu, the ANC's former secretary general who, along with five of his colleagues, served 26 years in prison before being released two weeks ago.
05/wsj_0559:Some members of the huge crowd shouted "Viva peace, viva." 
05/wsj_0559:The government and the ANC, the bitterest of enemies, are engaged in an elaborate mating dance designed to entice each other to the negotiating table.
05/wsj_0559:Pretoria releases the ANC leaders, most of whom were serving life sentences, and allows them to speak freely, hoping that the ANC will abandon its use of violence.
05/wsj_0559:The ANC leaders speak in tones of moderation, emphasizing discipline, hoping the government will be encouraged to take further steps, such as freeing Nelson Mandela, the most prominent ANC figure, and unbanning the organization. 
05/wsj_0559:The government of President F.W. de Klerk is using this situation to improve its international image and head off further economic sanctions.
05/wsj_0559:Meanwhile, the many organizations inside the country that back the ANC are taking the opportunity to regain their strength and mobilize their supporters even though the state of emergency, which has severely curtailed black opposition, remains in force. 
05/wsj_0559:In a message read out at the rally, exiled ANC President Oliver Tambo, who can't legally be quoted in South Africa, said the country was at a crossroads and that Mr. de Klerk "may yet earn a place among the peacemakers of our country" if he chooses a "path of genuine political settlement." 
05/wsj_0559:For instance, it releases Mr. Sisulu without conditions, yet his son, Zwelakhe, a newspaper editor, is restricted to his home much of the day and isn't allowed to work as a journalist. 
05/wsj_0559:The recently released leaders sat high atop a podium in one section of the stadium stands.
05/wsj_0559:Behind them was a huge ANC flag and an even bigger sign that said "ANC Lives, ANC Leads." Next to them was the red flag of the outlawed South African Communist Party, which has long been an ANC ally.
05/wsj_0559:"Today," said Mr. Sisulu, "the ANC has captured the center stage of political life in South Africa." 
05/wsj_0559:As a police helicopter circled overhead, Mr. Sisulu repeated the ANC's demands on the government to create a climate for negotiations: Release all political prisoners unconditionally; lift all bans and restrictions on individuals and organizations; remove all troops from the black townships; end the state of emergency, and cease all political trials and political executions.
05/wsj_0559:"There can be no question of us unilaterally abandoning the armed struggle," he said. "To date, we see no clear indication that the government is serious about negotiations.
05/wsj_0559:Echoing a phrase from Mr. de Klerk, Mr. Sisulu said, "Let all of us who love this country engage in the task of building a new South Africa." 
05/wsj_0560:But now Westinghouse is enjoying a resurgence in demand for both steam and combustion turbines and may even join the growing legion of independent electric producers.
05/wsj_0560:Most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities, and Westinghouse believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years. 
05/wsj_0560:Analysts agree, predicting that the revived market could significantly boost Westinghouse's bottom line in coming years. "Westinghouse's earnings could be materially enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner," says Russell L. Leavitt, of Salomon Brothers Inc.
05/wsj_0560:The company expects a need for 140,000 megawatts of new generation in the U.S. over the next decade.
05/wsj_0560:But last June's annnouncement that Westinghouse would put up all of the $70 million to build a new 55-megawatt plant could herald a new age.
05/wsj_0560:"We haven't decided on a strategy yet, but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we're the developer or just the supplier," says Theodore Stern, executive vice president of the company's energy and utility systems group. 
05/wsj_0560:In addition, the two companies will develop new steam turbine technology, such as the plants ordered by Florida Power, and even utilize each other's plants at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations. 
05/wsj_0560:"Even though we'll still compete against Mitsubishi, we can also work jointly on some projects, and we'll gain a lot of sourcing flexibility," Mr. Stern contends. 
05/wsj_0560:Westinghouse expects about half of its new orders for turbines to come from independent producers for at least the next six years. 
05/wsj_0560:Despite shutdowns of the company's Lester and East Pittsburgh plants, the company believes it has sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing facilities in North Carolina. 
05/wsj_0560:The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it hasn't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade.
05/wsj_0561:That put the "seven" of Oct. 17 in perspective for me.
05/wsj_0561:Think I'll buy one of those "I Survived" T-shirts after all. 
05/wsj_0561:The Pale Pachyderms propelled six of 'em out of the unfriendly confines of Candlestick Park during the two games en route to 13-7 and 9-6 wins over the San Francisco Giants.
05/wsj_0561:Combined with their two pre-quake victories, way back on Oct. 14 and 15 (the scores were 5-0 and 5-1, remember?), that gave them a sweep of the best-of-seven series. 
05/wsj_0561:That came in the seventh inning of Game Four when, trailing 8-2, they scored four times and brought their big heat -- Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell -- to the plate with one out and a runner on.
05/wsj_0561:But Clark flied out to short right field and Mitchell's drive to left was caught on the warning track by Rickey Henderson as 62,000 sets of lungs exhaled as one. 
05/wsj_0561:"I went out to Todd {Burns, the A's reliever} and told him that we weren't gonna let this guy beat us," said Oakland catcher Terry Steinbach of the decisive confrontation with Mitchell, the National League's reigning home-run king. "I told him to make Mitchell reach for everything, and that's what we did.
05/wsj_0561:The best baseball teams win six of 10 games and the worst win four of 10.
05/wsj_0561:Without becoming overly contentious, allow me to suggest that several recent champions of the world according to us (as in U.S.) might not have ranked No. 1 in many polls.
05/wsj_0561:The pithiest testimony to their domination of the just-concluded tournament came from Giants' manager Roger Craig after his team had fallen in Game Three to a five-home-run barrage that tied a 61-year-old Series record.
05/wsj_0561:Asked what he would do differently on the morrow, Craig allowed that he might play his outfielders deeper, "maybe on the other side of the fence." 
05/wsj_0561:Stewart's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds.
05/wsj_0561:Indeed, the possibility of an A's ring cycle, a/k/a a dynasty, was a major topic of post-game discussion Saturday, so much so that Sandy Alderson, the team's general manager, felt obliged to dampen it. "People change, teams change," he cautioned. "It's easier to get worse than better in this game." 
05/wsj_0561:He might have added an interesting historical fact: The last Series sweep, by the Cincinnati Reds, came in 1976, which also was the first year of baseball player free agency.
05/wsj_0562:The rationale for responding to your customers' needs faster than the competition can is clear: Your company will benefit in terms of market share, customer satisfaction and profitability.
05/wsj_0562:In fact, managers today are probably more aware of speed as a competitive variable than ever before.
05/wsj_0562:"Most of us grew up believing in the axioms `Haste makes waste' and `Don't cut corners, ' ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed," says Dean Cassell, vice president for product integrity at Grumman Corp. "But in the real world, you learn that speed and quality are not a trade-off.
05/wsj_0562:Speed is a component of quality -- one of the things we must deliver to satisfy customers." 
05/wsj_0562:Companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations.
05/wsj_0562:Managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed, and shift some responsibility for analyzing, improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees. 
05/wsj_0562:Following a problem-solving formula used by teams throughout Federal Express, members of the Natick team monitored their morning routine, carefully noting where and when the work group's resources were used effectively and where they were idle, waiting for others upstream in the process to send packages their way. 
05/wsj_0562:Winners of the friendly competition earn a steak dinner out with their spouses. 
05/wsj_0562:"The team included craftsmen from the shop floor as well as engineering, scheduling and purchasing personnel," reports Alan Westendorf, director of quality. "First, they produced a flowchart detailing the process by which an air-separation plant actually gets built.
05/wsj_0562:The Tonawanda team determined that holdups for inspections were the main problem and identified which kinds of delays involved critical inspections and which were less critical or could be handled by workers already on the line.
05/wsj_0562:"The streamlined manufacturing process benefits our customers in at least two ways," Mr. Westendorf concludes. "First, we have better quality assurance than ever, because the people building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work.
05/wsj_0562:The team was composed of representatives from engineering, manufacturing, corporate estimating, flight test, material, quality control, and other departments. 
05/wsj_0562:"We needed contributions from all these departments to generate the proposal," says Carl Anton, configuration-data manager for Grumman's A-6 combat aircraft program. "But instead of gathering their input piecemeal, we formed the team, which reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work to guide all the functions that were involved." 
05/wsj_0562:Armed with this shared understanding and requisite background information, each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal, submitting data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule. "We cleared up questions and inconsistencies very quickly, because the people who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part of the task team," Mr. Anton explains. 
05/wsj_0562:The successes achieved at Federal Express, Union Carbide and Grumman suggest that managing speed may be an underutilized source of competitive advantage.
05/wsj_0562:Managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction.
05/wsj_0562:And they prepare all their people to increase the speed and improve the quality of their own work. 
05/wsj_0562:Mr. Labovitz is president of ODI, a consulting firm in Burlington, Mass. 
05/wsj_0563:Home taping of pre-recorded music cuts into record industry revenues, but banning home taping would hurt consumers even more. 
05/wsj_0563:That's the conclusion of an independent report prepared by the Office of Technology Assessment at the request of the House and Senate judiciary committees.
05/wsj_0563:The report says the availability of such advanced analog recording equipment as cassette recorders doesn't seem to increase the quantity of home copying.
05/wsj_0563:That finding, the report says, casts doubt on the record industry's contention that the new generation of digital recording equipment will inevitably lead to wholesale abuse of copyrighted material by home tapers. 
05/wsj_0563:The longstanding position of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group based in Washington, D.C., is that record companies, performers, songwriters and music publishers need to be remunerated by government-imposed fees on the sale of blank tapes and recording equipment to make up for royalties lost to home taping. 
05/wsj_0563:"I think it is a nail in the coffin in any royalty tax proposal," says Gary Shapiro, vice president for government and legal affairs of the Electronic Industries Association in Washington. "What {the report} shows is everything we've been saying for the past eight or nine years -- that audio taping is the best thing to happen for the recording industry.
05/wsj_0563:Trish Heimers, a spokesperson for RIAA says her organization hasn't received a copy of the completed report yet and has no immediate comment. 
05/wsj_0563:A recent agreement between the recording industry and electronics manufacturers requires that any digital audio tape, or DAT, recorder sold in the U.S. have a built-in device that restricts its ability to make second copies from DAT tape copies of digital compact disks.
05/wsj_0563:But the disappointing sales of DAT machines here and abroad so far have not seemed to warrant the three years of legal wrangling that went into the agreement. 
05/wsj_0563:Under current copyright laws, it is considered "fair use" to reproduce copyrighted material for one's personal use or for use by one's family or friends, while copying for purposes of resale or profit is prohibited.
05/wsj_0563:A survey contained in the 291-page report, "Copyright and Home Copying: Technology Challenges the Law," found that most people consider home copying for such personal use a "right" -- a right, moreover, that was exercised by 40% of Americans over the age of 10 in the past year. 
05/wsj_0563:The study says that the "ambiguous legal status" of home copying makes it "appropriate to examine the effects on consumers, as well as on industry." Reports by the Office of Technology Assessment don't prescribe any specific legislative action but suggest a range of options that Congress may pursue. 
05/wsj_0563:The study also says that advent of new communications technologies makes "an explicit congressional definition of the legal status of home copying more desirable in order to reduce legal and market uncertainties and to prevent de facto changes to copyright law through technology," and says that finding an "appropriate balance of harms and benefits is a political decision, not a technical one." 
05/wsj_0564:And in little more than a decade of being friendly -- and at the same time rocking the staid Swiss business community with some U.S.-style wheeling and dealing -- the 46-year-old Mr. Rey has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire.
05/wsj_0564:He achieved this in part with an uncanny talent for getting his foot peacefully in the door of established European companies. 
05/wsj_0564:His latest coup: September's masterminding of the five billion Swiss-franc ($3.07 billion) merger between Adia S.A., the world's second-largest temporary employment agency, and Inspectorate International S.A., a Rey-controlled product-inspection company. 
05/wsj_0564:Shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late November.
05/wsj_0564:After the transaction, Mr. Rey estimates the value of his 20% stake in the new company, to be held by his Omni Holding AG, will be about 1 billion Swiss francs.
05/wsj_0564:This will be his return on an original investment of between 50 million Swiss francs and 80 million Swiss francs.
05/wsj_0564:"I like to succeed," says Mr. Rey during a recent morning of working at home, which he also likes.
05/wsj_0564:Home is an estate with green meadows opening onto Lake Geneva and a low-slung house whose rooms overlook the water and offer a view of the French Alps.
05/wsj_0564:In the corner of his reception room is a delicate antique desk piled high with dossiers.
05/wsj_0564:Zurich-based magazine Bilanz lists Mr. Rey as having a fortune of about 1.5 billion Swiss francs.
05/wsj_0564:In 1976, as an upstart in the eyes of Switzerland's establishment, Mr. Rey laid the foundations of his present-day prominence with an unheard-of raid on Bally, the country's traditional shoemaker. 
05/wsj_0564:Sitting beside a banker at a luncheon in London, where he was working as a financial consultant, he learned that a large packet of Bally's shares was up for sale.
05/wsj_0564:Looking into Bally, he could hardly believe what he saw: a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major European cities and a market capitalization of 28 million Swiss francs; it had 7,000 employees. 
05/wsj_0564:Investing four million Swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million Swiss francs from his parents and his wife, Mr. Rey acquired 20% of Bally's shares. 
05/wsj_0564:But such tactics were alien to Switzerland in 1976, and still aren't common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain.
05/wsj_0564:In 1979, his career as an industrialist began with the acquisition of the Swiss metals works Selve, based in Thun.
05/wsj_0564:Three years later, machinery producer Ateliers de Constructions Mecaniques de Vevey S.A. was to become part of the Rey empire.
05/wsj_0564:A major boost to Mr. Rey's respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60% of his Phibro Bank to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks.
05/wsj_0564:In 1987, Mr. Rey bested leading publishing houses to take over Switzerland's Jean Frey AG, a major producer of magazines and newspapers. 
05/wsj_0564:And with the recent acquisition of 30% of Winterthur-based machinery manufacturer Gebrueder Sulzer AG, Mr. Rey has enjoyed the status of white knight.
05/wsj_0564:Meanwhile, as such strategic investments have mounted, the merchant-banking arm of Mr. Rey's Omni Holding has been busily buying and selling dozens of companies, often after a financial or corporate restructuring. 
05/wsj_0564:Today, this branch of Mr. Rey's empire runs under the name Omnicorp Offering Services and handles mergers and acquisitions, placement of securities and real estate.
05/wsj_0564:In its portfolio are such diverse companies as United Kingdom-based Air Europe; Checkrobot Inc., a U.S. company that makes supermarket checkout machines; Norment Industries, a U.S. manufacturer of securities systems; Com Systems Inc., a U.S. regional telephone company; and major real-estate projects in the U.S. and Europe. 
05/wsj_0564:For financial analysts, reading Omni's accounts is a tough challenge. "Companies move in and out," says Helga Kern of KK Swiss Investment. 
05/wsj_0564:Financial analysts note that Mr. Rey is attracted to companies that are undervalued on the basis of their real-estate interests.
05/wsj_0564:In August, Omni unexpectedly bought Inspectorate's 80% stake in Harpener AG of West Germany, a land-rich company.
05/wsj_0564:The internal transaction within the Rey empire puzzled Harpener's small shareholders, but analysts say it makes sense for Inspectorate-Adia to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help. 
05/wsj_0564:Mr. Rey says the move is yet another example of his conservatism.
05/wsj_0565:Ultimate Corp. signed a letter of intent to market Hewlett-Packard Co. minicomputers, the companies said. 
05/wsj_0565:Under terms of the pact, Ultimate, a computer-systems concern, will market the full line of HP 9000 series 800 multipleuser minicomputers.
05/wsj_0566:In the second step of a reorganization that began earlier this year, Boeing Co. said it will create a Defense and Space Group to consolidate several divisions. 
05/wsj_0566:Meanwhile, Boeing officials and representatives of the Machinists union met separately last night with a federal mediator in an attempt to break the month-old strike that has shut the aerospace giant's assembly lines at a time when it has an $80 billion backlog of jetliner orders.
05/wsj_0566:Machinists already have rejected a package that would provide a 10% pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract.
05/wsj_0566:However, the resolve of some of the striking 57,000 machinists might be weakening.
05/wsj_0566:While Boeing's commercial business is booming, its military business is feeling the effects of a declining defense budget after a strong buildup during the Reagan presidency.
05/wsj_0566:B. Dan Pinick, president of Boeing Aerospace and Electronics, will become president of the new group, which will become operational Jan. 2. 
05/wsj_0566:All of the changes will reduce its overhead and streamline operations, Boeing said. 
05/wsj_0566:Howard Rubel, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York, said the shift reflects Boeing confidence in Mr. Pinick, described by Mr. Rubel as an expert on doing business with the military. "His side of the business has been successful in a tough environment," Mr. Rubel said. 
05/wsj_0567:A two-day meeting of representatives of Cocom, the 17-nation group that oversees exports of sensitive goods to communist countries, didn't take any substantive decisions on trimming the list of items under controls.
05/wsj_0567:The U.S. had been under pressure from several Cocom members, especially France, West Germany and Italy, to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools, which those countries argued were now widely available to East Bloc countries from non-Cocom members.
05/wsj_0567:But U.S. officials said representatives at the meeting decided that this was "a matter for further discussion at future meetings." They added that "all of us (Cocom members) look at the changes in Hungary and Poland in a positive way, but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study." The officials also said the meeting agreed to continue treating China as a special case, despite the recent repression of dissent there, but to offer no further concessions. 
05/wsj_0567:The U.S. officials said that despite the rapid changes under way in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, all the Cocom members agreed on "the continuing need for this organization," which was founded 40 years ago at the start of the Cold War.
05/wsj_0567:The officials said this meeting "put in motion" procedural steps that would speed up both of these functions, but that no specific decisions were taken on either matter. 
05/wsj_0568:Unisys Corp. 's announcement Friday of a $648.2 million loss for the third quarter showed that the company is moving even faster than expected to take write-offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround next year. 
05/wsj_0568:At the same time, the sheer size of the loss, coupled with a slowing of orders, made some securities analysts wonder just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and defense-electronics concern. 
05/wsj_0568:Unisys, whose revenue inched up 3.7% in the quarter to $2.35 billion from $2.27 billion in the year-earlier quarter, had an operating loss of about $30 million.
05/wsj_0568:On top of that, the Blue Bell, Pa., concern took a $230 million charge related to the layoffs of 8,000 employees.
05/wsj_0568:That is at the high end of the range of 7,000 to 8,000 employees that Unisys said a month ago would be laid off.
05/wsj_0568:Unisys said that should help it save $500 million a year in costs, again at the high end of the previously reported range of $400 million to $500 million. 
05/wsj_0568:The company also took a write-off of $150 million to cover losses on some fixed-price defense contracts, as some new managers took a hard look at the prospects for that slow-growing business.
05/wsj_0568:In addition, Unisys set up an unspecified reserve -- apparently $60 million to $70 million -- to cover the minimum amount it will have to pay the government because of its involvement in the defense-procurement scandal.
05/wsj_0568:In addition, Unisys said it reduced computer inventories a further $100 million during the quarter, leaving it within $100 million of its goal of a reduction of $500 million by the end of the year. 
05/wsj_0568:Debt has risen to around $4 billion, or about 50% of total capitalization.
05/wsj_0568:That means Unisys must pay about $100 million in interest every quarter, on top of $27 million in dividends on preferred stock. 
05/wsj_0568:He said the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect, and doesn't see much revenue growth in the cards. 
05/wsj_0568:He also said that the price wars flaring up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year.
05/wsj_0568:But we don't minimize the challenges of the near term." 
05/wsj_0568:Some had predicted earnings of more than $4 a share for this year, up from last year's fully diluted $3.27 a share on earnings of $680.6 million.
05/wsj_0568:But the company said Friday that it had losses of $673.3 million through the first nine months, compared with earnings a year earlier of $382.2 million, or $2.22 a share fully diluted, as revenue inched up 1.4% to $7.13 billion from $7.03 billion.
05/wsj_0568:Mr. Weil of Weil & Associates said he will remain at $1 a share for next year but said he wonders whether even that low target is at risk. "The break-even point for next year is much lower, but is it low enough?" he asked. 
05/wsj_0569:The chief economist of Merrill Lynch & Co. finds himself in such a position as he buzzes the Midwest on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction. 
05/wsj_0569:Since the last time he traveled this way several months ago, he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession.
05/wsj_0569:The forecasts were widely disseminated, and, in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988, Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds.
05/wsj_0569:It said long-term interest rates, then above 9%, could drop to 7% by the end of 1989, so bonds, which benefit from falling rates, would be a good buy.
05/wsj_0569:The firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40% to 45% and later to 55%. 
05/wsj_0569:Now, in fact, he is predicting economic growth of 2.9% this year and 2.1% next year, a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter. 
05/wsj_0569:Two well-known colleagues who believe Mr. Straszheim was right the first time are David Bostian Jr. and A. Gary Shilling, both of whom run their own New York research firms.
05/wsj_0569:But the surprisingly durable seven-year economic expansion has made mincemeat of more than one forecast. 
05/wsj_0569:Carrying the new message on the road, Mr. Straszheim meets confrontation that often occurs in inverse proportion to the size of the client.
05/wsj_0569:Dennis O'Brien, the treasurer of Commonwealth Edison Co. in Chicago, adopts a polite approach, waiting for an opportunity to ask about the forecast.
05/wsj_0569:A good half-hour into breakfast at the Palmer House, Mr. O'Brien looks up from his plate after Mr. Straszheim says something about people who believe interest rates are about to nosedive. "I'm one of them who hope they will, with $6 billion in debt on the books.
05/wsj_0569:He doesn't fully succeed, although Mr. Straszheim lists an array of interest-rate scenarios. 
05/wsj_0569:One of Mr. Straszheim's recurring themes is that the state of the economy isn't a simple black or white.
05/wsj_0569:This somewhat-ambiguous assessment moves one Alliance portfolio manager to ask: "So, what is this -- a Stealth recession?" Another challenges Merrill Lynch's bond recommendation last year. "We're not running that ad campaign any more," Mr. Straszheim snaps in a rare show of irritation.
05/wsj_0569:Explaining his change of mind, Mr. Straszheim says later, "It's hard to pin this on one factor." He says the economy, and especially the employment numbers, look much better than he expected; interest rates have generally declined; inflation hasn't run amok. "Our business is constantly looking at all these things," he says.
05/wsj_0569:We pulled that forecast," he begins matter-of-factly in a meeting with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. officials in Minneapolis, the first stop. 
05/wsj_0570:Crane Co. said it holds an 8.9% stake in Milton Roy Corp., an analytical-instruments maker, and may seek control of the company. 
05/wsj_0570:Crane, a maker of engineered products for aerospace, construction, defense and other uses, made the disclosure in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. 
05/wsj_0570:In the filing, Crane said that in the past it considered seeking control of Milton Roy, of St. Petersburg, Fla., through a merger or tender offer and that it expects to continue to evaluate an acquisition from time to time.
05/wsj_0570:John M. McNamara, chief financial officer of Milton Roy, said the company has no comment on Crane's filing. 
05/wsj_0570:Milton Roy recently fended off unsolicited overtures from Thermo Electron Corp., a Waltham, Mass., maker of biomedical products.
05/wsj_0570:Thermo Electron acquired some 6% of Milton Roy's common stock before throwing in the towel and reducing its stake in early September. 
05/wsj_0570:Earlier this month, Milton Roy signed a letter of intent to acquire Automated Custom Systems Inc., Orange, Calif., and its sister operation, Environmental Testing Co., in Aurora, Colo.
05/wsj_0570:Under the terms, Milton Roy will pay an initial $4 million for the operations and additional payments during the next four years based on the earnings performance of the businesses. 
05/wsj_0570:In the nine months, Milton Roy earned $6.6 million, or $1.18 a share, on sales of $94.3 million. 
05/wsj_0571:The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, resigned because Prime Minister Thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser Sir Alan Walters.
05/wsj_0571:The opposition Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock, in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class, denounced Mrs. Thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her Cabinet.
05/wsj_0571:The British press, making a mountain out of a molehill, precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying Mrs. Thatcher as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government. 
05/wsj_0571:This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher's policies had created, producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls. 
05/wsj_0571:Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher's political fortune, Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System, which subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy.
05/wsj_0571:The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals, the media and the imagination, but are full of practical pitfalls. 
05/wsj_0571:When a country cuts tax rates, it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency. 
05/wsj_0571:It was fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationships that caused the Chirac government in France to be timid about cutting tax rates.
05/wsj_0571:The price of attracting capital -- whether one's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit.
05/wsj_0571:The British balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40%, the flow abroad of British capital slowed, to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986.
05/wsj_0571:Nigel Lawson was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s.
05/wsj_0571:The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment, instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates.
05/wsj_0571:Britain and all of Europe need to reconsider the prospects for European integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of Germany.
05/wsj_0571:A unified Germany that remained within the Western alliance would give Germany such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified Europe would become vassals of the German state.
05/wsj_0571:The implications for Britain, France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson's resignation to be unfortunate. 
05/wsj_0571:In the least, we must recognize the futility of trying to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the effects of tax-rate reduction on capital flows. 
05/wsj_0572:Joseph P. Jordan, 52 years old, becomes president, chief executive officer and a director of the bank company.
05/wsj_0572:Mr. Jordan, formerly president and chief executive of Fishkill National Bank in Beacon, N.Y., succeeds Donald Broderick, who died at 52 in an automobile accident. 
05/wsj_0573:Personal spending, which fueled the economy's growth in the third quarter, was clearly slowing by the end of the period, raising questions about the economy's strength as the year ends. 
05/wsj_0573:At the same time, personal income was held down by the effects of Hurricane Hugo, which tore through parts of North and South Carolina in late September.
05/wsj_0573:Among the economic effects of the hurricane was a sharp drop in rental income. 
05/wsj_0573:"I think the consumer has pretty well played himself out," said David Littman, senior economist at Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit. 
05/wsj_0573:"I don't think there's a lot in the wings" in other sectors of the economy to keep growth above 1%, he said.
05/wsj_0573:Analysts have attributed much of the summer's spurt in spending to bargain car prices at the end of the model year.
05/wsj_0573:The nation's savings rate was unchanged in September at 4.9% of after-tax income, far below the 5.6% it reached in July. 
05/wsj_0573:The figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates in trillions of dollars. 
05/wsj_0574:CRA Ltd. said it agreed to sell a 40% stake in its Howick coal mine in the state of New South Wales to Mitsubishi Development Pty. of Japan. 
05/wsj_0574:CRA said then that it was looking for a partner for the mine, which produces more than three million metric tons of coal a year. 
05/wsj_0574:CRA is 49%-owned by RTZ Corp. of Britain. 
05/wsj_0575:During that time, Control Data had losses of more than $1 billion. 
05/wsj_0575:So its senior executives are talking openly about possibly buying back some of the company's $172.5 million in subordinated convertible debentures next year. 
05/wsj_0575:The offer was automatically triggered by the recent sale of Control Data's Imprimis disk-drive business to Seagate Technology Inc. 
05/wsj_0575:He said the company has no intention of tapping its short-term bank lines "for a good part of 1990." Sometime next year, Control Data will "develop a new bank relationship," Mr. Perlman said.
05/wsj_0575:In recent months a group of lenders, led by Bank of America, has extended Control Data up to $90 million in revolving loans through January, as well as $115 million in standby letters of credit. 
05/wsj_0575:Loan covenants require that the company achieve specified levels of operating earnings and meet a rolling four-quarter profitability test.
05/wsj_0575:Last week Control Data reported third-quarter earnings of $9.8 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $763 million.
05/wsj_0575:Through the first nine months, the company had a loss of $484 million, largely reflecting the closing of its supercomputer unit. 
05/wsj_0575:While a few assets are still being shopped -- including the sports and entertainment ticketing portion of the company's Ticketron unit -- Mr. Price said future restructuring would be a question of strategy. "We don't need the cash." 
05/wsj_0575:Rather, Mr. Perlman said, Control Data intends to bid for the coming Minnesota lottery contract and is seeking new applications for the technology overseas, where "there is great interest in games of skill." He wouldn't elaborate. 
05/wsj_0575:Control Data's semiconductor business, VTC Inc., continues to lose money, the executives acknowledged, but they said they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are reluctant to dispose of it. 
05/wsj_0575:The company's strategy for keeping its computer products business profitable -- it recently achieved profitability after several quarters of losses -- calls for a narrow focus and a lid on expenses.
05/wsj_0575:James E. Ousley, computer products group president, said such arrangements could help slash Control Data's computer research and development costs in half by the end of 1990.
05/wsj_0575:He disclosed that before Control Data scrapped its ETA Systems Inc. supercomputer business this past spring, those costs were running at nearly 35% of group revenue.
05/wsj_0575:At the same time four of six design projects were spiked, he said. 
05/wsj_0575:Asked how the company hopes to expand its computer hardware business, Mr. Ousley said it sees good opportunities in systems integration. "We think we're getting only 10% of the integration dollars our customers are spending," he said. "We're in environments that are going to spend a lot of money on that." 
05/wsj_0575:Perlman nor Price said he spends much time considering the possibility of a hostile takeover. "We've been listed as a candidate for so long it's not worth worrying about," said Mr. Price. 
05/wsj_0576:Having resided in the great state of California for the past seven years, I find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when I start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air; when I try to enjoy the beaches and come home covered with tar and oil; when I hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing. 
05/wsj_0576:Perhaps it's entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists, suggesting that their save-the-earth initiatives are "whacky" and referring to so many citizens as "la-la activists." Strange that we don't hear similar criticisms of the East Coast activists who seek to clean up Boston Harbor or rid their beaches of medical waste. 
05/wsj_0576:Wright's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among "la-la activists." Indeed, Wright said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature.
05/wsj_0576:Obviously, it's lost on you that about 75% of the American people these days (and in fact the president of the United States) consider themselves environmentalists. 
05/wsj_0576:Your editorial was commendable and neatly matched by the readers' comments in letters to the editor, "Alar: Scaring on the Side of Caution." The illogic and inaccuracy of John H. Adams's comments for the National Resources Defense Council fully justifies your characterization of California's Greens in particular as "la-la activists." We may all hope that California's voters will heed the scientific realities that their own university's renowned Prof.
05/wsj_0576:Would-be naysayers should have the burden of proving reasonable necessity when they urge a prohibition for enactment into law. 
05/wsj_0576:The 170 airlines in the International Air Transport Association last year posted group net profit of $2.5 billion on revenue of $125.1 billion. 
05/wsj_0576:Revenue last year increased by more than 11% over 1988, and net income nearly tripled from restated year-earlier net of $900 million. 
05/wsj_0576:The group attributed the strong results to the favorable economic climate, rising demand for air travel and improved average yield (revenue received per ton of traffic transported a kilometer).
05/wsj_0576:The association said that lack of airport and air space capacity is the biggest problem facing the airline industry. 
05/wsj_0576:The newspaper quoted KGB chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov as saying the definition of anti-Soviet crimes had narrowed, the laws had changed and people no longer have to fear a simple slip of the tongue.
05/wsj_0576:Mr. Kryuchkov was quoted as saying that in place of the infamous 5th Directorate a new unit would work "to foil the conspiracies of foreign intelligence services to create and use organized anti-government groups in our country." 
05/wsj_0576:Czechoslovakia has restricted consumer-goods exports to neighbor countries because of "massive buying out of food" by tourists from Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union, the Rude Pravo daily said.
05/wsj_0576:The paper gave no details of what the restrictions would entail but said the measures were necessary to protect the domestic market. 
05/wsj_0576:Last week came news of alarm in Venice over a plan to tap gas fields off the city's coast.
05/wsj_0576:Now comes word from a scientist that over the next century Venice will sink nearly three times faster than the present rate because of the "greenhouse effect." "Global warming means higher tides which will lower Venice by another 23 inches in the next 100 years," Giovanni Cecconi of the the New Venice Consortium said.
05/wsj_0576:The consortium of scientists and companies was set up by Italy to help preserve the fabled city of canals.
05/wsj_0576:Intermoda will initially only send the textile and clothing section of the Quelle catalog, translated into Russian, to Soviet customers who have access to convertible currency. 
05/wsj_0576:The European Community Commission has imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of South Korean small-screen color-television sets. 
05/wsj_0576:Saying that a surge in low-priced imports had damaged EC producers' profits and led to job losses, the commission imposed a duty of 10.2% on TVs made by Daewoo, a duty of 12.3% on Goldstar Co., 13% on Samsung and 19.6% on TVs made by other South Korean producers. 
05/wsj_0576:The commission said that EC television producers lost "important market shares" and suffered an "unsustainable" pressure on prices because of the Korean companies' marketing and pricing policies, which it said were "in clear violation" of international trade rules. 
05/wsj_0576:In other news concerning South Korea's television industry, Samsung signed an agreement with Soyuz, the external-trade organization of the Soviet Union, to swap Korean television sets and videocassette recorders for pig iron from the Soviet Union.
05/wsj_0576:Sri Lanka, where more than 15,000 people have died in six years of ethnic turmoil, said it will ban sex and violence from state-owned television next year. "Many programs we have now come from the West and are not suitable to our culture," a government minister said.
05/wsj_0576:A star attraction on the national network is the U.S.'s "Dynasty." . . . A poll of South Koreans showed overwhelming opposition to efforts to curb dog-meat consumption just because it offends foreigners. 
05/wsj_0577:Broad Inc. said it doubled its regular quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 2.5 cents on common, and to 4.5 cents a share 2.25 cents on Class B stock, payable Nov. 10 to holders of record Nov. 6. 
05/wsj_0577:The financial services company emerged from the restructuring of Kaufman & Broad, Inc., which spun off its home-building subsidiary into Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. earlier this year and changed its name to Broad Inc. 
05/wsj_0577:This would compare with an estimated loss of 3 cents a share for the comparable 10 months last year, which included restructuring costs. 
05/wsj_0578:Mr. Peters would fly to New York with the intention of telling Warner Communications Inc. Chairman Steven J. Ross that Guber-Peters planned to end its five-year contract to produce movies exclusively for Warner. 
05/wsj_0578:In affidavits filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in connection with the $1 billion breach-of-contract suit Warner brought against Sony for hiring the two producers, Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters tell one story.
05/wsj_0578:Mr. Peters claims he reminded Mr. Ross that Robert Daly and Terry Semel, the top executives of the Warner Brothers studio, had "repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept" an offer such as Sony's.
05/wsj_0578:Tomorrow, Warner will file another batch of documents contending that "the essence of everything these guys are saying is basically lies," says Warner's chief outside counsel, Stuart Rabinowitz.
05/wsj_0578:The battery of legal documents filed in the past week in connection with the suit provide a peek into the inner workings of this Hollywood dogfight.
05/wsj_0578:But they also make it clear that the first thing a judge will have to decide is which, if any, version of events in this morass is fiction, and which fact. 
05/wsj_0578:Warner says that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations, but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between Warner and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired.
05/wsj_0578:Warner, which is in the process of merging with Time Warner Inc., says it is willing to settle the matter out of court.
05/wsj_0578:Sony, for its part, could decide that the cost of a Warner settlement or court fight is too high, choosing instead to find someone else to run Columbia, although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters.
05/wsj_0578:In that case, Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not suffer financially, but they would be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably scarred relationship with Warner. 
05/wsj_0578:At the center of any court fight will be the differing interpretations of the written contract between Warner and the two producers, but other murkier issues will play a big role.
05/wsj_0578:Sony and the Guber-Peters team are hanging much of their case on Warner's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up.
05/wsj_0578:Warner denies such an agreement was made, and disputes the Guber-Peters version of virtually every telephone call and meeting the two sides had on the matter. 
05/wsj_0578:Just how rancorous the relationship has become is clear from the differing versions of the two sides' current business dealings.
05/wsj_0578:Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits that Warner already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at Warner, notably the Sylvester Stallone film "Tango and Cash." 
05/wsj_0578:Mr. Peters says in his affidavit that the movie's staff was told last week that Warner was "taking over" the picture, and another producer would be giving all of the orders.
05/wsj_0578:Over his objections, Mr. Peters says, the film's release date was moved up "by many months" to December, and plans for a soundtrack "worth millions of dollars" were dropped. 
05/wsj_0578:That, says Warner's Mr. Rabinowitz, is "a total 100% lie." The movie, he says, is in its post-production stages of "cleaning up the film." He says Mr. Peters and Mr. Guber, as the contractual producers with consultation rights, have been invited to screenings and to give their input on the film.
05/wsj_0578:Dozens of Guber-Peters staffers are still working on the Warner lot and consulting on various projects on a "daily basis," the attorney says. 
05/wsj_0578:Mr. Guber, in his affidavit, says that when he advised Warner President Terry Semel of the Sony offer at lunch on Sept. 25, Mr. Semel "hugged and congratulated me, and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long-term ambition of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company." 
05/wsj_0578:Mr. Guber says he brought to lunch a release document Warner had agreed to in 1988, when he and Mr. Peters made an aborted bid to buy part of MGM/UA Entertainment Co. to run the MGM studio.
05/wsj_0578:He says he told Mr. Guber he couldn't sign any documents and that "the deal, although apparently a good one for him and Mr. Peters, would have a very negative impact on Warner." He said he would contact Mr. Ross and Warner Brothers Chairman Robert Daly and that, in a conference call, the three agreed they couldn't let the producers out of their contract. 
05/wsj_0578:Mr. Guber says that Mr. Semel did convey that information and that Mr. Semel said Mr. Ross was "crazy because of the Time deal," meaning, Mr. Guber says, that Mr. Ross "did not want to communicate to his new merger partner, Time Inc., that Warner's agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances." 
05/wsj_0578:Mr. Guber also says in his affidavit that Mr. Daly "told us that even if Sony did not want us, Warner's relationship with us already was irreparably damaged, that there was no way `to put the egg together, ' and that it would sue Sony for tons of money." 
05/wsj_0578:But Sony is a problem." The Guber-Peters side has said Warner is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge Japanese company controlling important segments of the U.S. entertainment business. 
05/wsj_0578:But the Warner executives in their affidavits deny ever telling the producers they could get out of their written contract. 
05/wsj_0578:But Mr. Guber indicates in his affidavit that not all of the projects will be used.
05/wsj_0579:The media company said it purchased Cable USA Inc., a privately held cable television system in Carroll County, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta.
05/wsj_0579:The system is still under construction and will serve a market of 7,600 homes. 
05/wsj_0579:The company also has acquired Sundance Publishers and Distributors Inc., a family owned producer and distributor of educational materials in Littleton, Mass. 
05/wsj_0580:Nevertheless, the 1989 deficit still exceeded the $136 billion target set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law by $16 billion, a reminder of that law's shortcomings. 
05/wsj_0580:The law sets a deficit target of $100 billion for fiscal 1990.
05/wsj_0580:A partisan fight over cutting capital-gains taxes has slowed the progress of 1990 deficit-reduction legislation almost to a halt, triggering across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. 
05/wsj_0580:Neither side showed any sign of retreating. 
05/wsj_0580:Underscoring the size of the deficits of the past few years, the Treasury report showed that for the first time interest paid on the public debt -- $240.86 billion -- exceeded spending on Social Security, the single largest government program. 
05/wsj_0580:The government ran a deficit of $6.16 billion in September, compared with a surplus of $10.17 billion in September 1988. 
05/wsj_0581:Consumers Power Co., now the main unit of CMS Energy, ran into financial problems over its $4.2 billion Midland nuclear plant, which was abandoned as a nuclear facility in 1984 because of construction delays and high costs.
05/wsj_0581:CMS is nearly done converting the Midland plant to a gas-fired cogeneration facility at a cost of $600 million. 
05/wsj_0581:CMS management said Thursday that they planned to recommend paying a modest dividend when the board of directors met Friday.
05/wsj_0581:The dividend will be paid Nov. 22 to shares of record Nov. 7. 
05/wsj_0581:The company suffered a loss of $270 million in 1985, but its financial situation has been improving since then.
05/wsj_0581:CMS said it earned $237.8 million in the first nine months of 
05/wsj_0582:Accrued interest on the refund was about $18 million as of Oct. 25. 
05/wsj_0583:Polly Peck International Inc. 's agreement to acquire 51% of Sansui Electric Co. proves that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies -- if the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction. 
05/wsj_0583:Polly Peck, a fast-growing British conglomerate, will pay 15.6 billion yen ($110 million) for 39 million new shares of Sansui, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions.
05/wsj_0583:Japanese government officials, eager to rebut foreign criticism of Japanese investments overseas, hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan.
05/wsj_0583:Polly Peck's chairman, Asil Nadir, echoed the official Japanese view of the accord, which was announced Friday. 
05/wsj_0583:It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen. "If you find sound, healthy companies in Japan, they are not for sale," said George Watanabe, a management-consultant at Tokyo-based Asia Advisory Services Inc. 
05/wsj_0583:Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because unlike Sansui, which is listed on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges, most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held.
05/wsj_0583:But by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this year, while Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies. 
05/wsj_0583:Nor do analysts expect the Sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases.
05/wsj_0583:If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies weren't deterrents enough, webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers. 
05/wsj_0583:Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining, and the grim demeanors of Sansui's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company's finest hour.
05/wsj_0583:Sansui was once one of Japan's premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles. 
05/wsj_0583:But in recent years, the market has moved toward less expensive "mini-component" sets, miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other. 
05/wsj_0583:Some of Sansui's fellow audio-specialty companies, such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp., responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own, by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields, including laser disks or portable cassette players.
05/wsj_0583:While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories, Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia. "Our company has not been able to cope very effectively with" changes in the marketplace, said Ryosuke Ito, Sansui's president. 
05/wsj_0583:Yoshihisa Murasawa, a management consultant for Booz-Allen & Hamilton (Japan) Inc., said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of Japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future. "Attitudes {toward being acquired} are still negative, but they're becoming more positive," Mr. Murasawa said. "In some industries, like pharmaceuticals, acquisitions make sense." 
05/wsj_0583:He said Polly Peck will greatly expand Sansui's product line, using Sansui's engineers to design the new products, and will move Sansui's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck's own factories. 
05/wsj_0583:"Whatever capital it (Sansui) needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world, that capital will be injected," Mr. Nadir said. 
05/wsj_0583:And while Polly Peck isn't jettisoning the existent top-management structure of Sansui, it is bringing in a former Toshiba Corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer. 
05/wsj_0583:Such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. Nadir, who is 25% owner of Polly Peck as well as its chairman.
05/wsj_0583:In September, it announced plans to acquire the tropical-fruit business of RJR Nabisco Inc. 's Del Monte foods unit for #557 million ($878 million). 
05/wsj_0584:But under new terms of the agreement, announced Friday, LIN holders would receive a special cash dividend of $42 a share, representing a payout of about $2.23 billion, shortly before the proposed merger.
05/wsj_0584:Under previous terms, holders would have received a dividend of only $20 a share. 
05/wsj_0584:In addition, New York-based LIN would exercise its right to buy out for $1.9 billion the 55% equity interest of its partner, Metromedia Co., in a New York cellular franchise.
05/wsj_0584:Analyst estimate the value of the BellSouth proposal at about $115 to $125 a share.
05/wsj_0584:McCaw, the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S., already owns about 9.4% of LIN's stock.
05/wsj_0584:Over the weekend, McCaw continued to call for an auction of LIN. Analysts said they expect McCaw to escalate the bidding again. 
05/wsj_0584:Under its revised proposal, Atlanta-based BellSouth would have a 50% interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt.
05/wsj_0584:To sweeten the pact further -- and to ease concerns of institutional investors -- BellSouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional Bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company.
05/wsj_0584:To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement, BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $10 a share, or $540 million, if, after five years, the trading value of the new cellular company isn't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer. 
05/wsj_0584:We didn't expect BellSouth to be so responsive," said Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., which holds 500,000 LIN shares.
05/wsj_0584:BellSouth's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts, especially because of the company's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings.
05/wsj_0584:William O. McCoy, president of the company's BellSouth Enterprises Inc. unit, said the revised agreement with LIN would dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9% in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter.
05/wsj_0584:For 1988, BellSouth earned $1.7 billion, or $3.51 a share, on revenue of $13.6 billion.
05/wsj_0584:Analysts were predicting 1990 BellSouth earnings in the range of $3.90 a share, or $1.9 billion, but now those estimates are being scaled back. 
05/wsj_0584:Mr. Leon of Bear Stearns speculated that McCaw, in an attempt to buy time, might consider filing an antitrust suit against BellSouth with the Justice Department and U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who oversees enforcement of the consent decree that broke up the Bell system in 1984. 
05/wsj_0584:Urging LIN directors to conduct "a fair auction on a level playing field," McCaw asked how well the public interest would be served "with the Bell operating companies controlling over 94% of all cellular {potential customers} in the nation's top 10 markets." 
05/wsj_0585:Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading. 
05/wsj_0585:The most controversial form of program trading, stock-index arbitrage, is "making it tough for traders to make money," declares Robert Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. 
05/wsj_0585:Stock-index arbitrage -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies -- affects the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
05/wsj_0585:The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading isn't known, as it is on the New York Stock Exchange, where it amounted to more than 13% in September.
05/wsj_0585:Estimates from traders put it at less than 5% of Nasdaq's average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares. 
05/wsj_0585:Other market-maker gripes: Program trading also causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market.
05/wsj_0585:Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves, a condition known as illiquidity.
05/wsj_0585:Some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the OTC market.
05/wsj_0585:But the big, often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been profiting from the practice against it. 
05/wsj_0585:Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, acknowledges that he wasn't troubled by program trading when it began in the pre-crash bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising. 
05/wsj_0585:Of course, there were sell programs in past years, too, but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days.
05/wsj_0585:That's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash, when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled.
05/wsj_0585:Market makers, to cut costs, slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders aren't selling. 
05/wsj_0585:In such an environment, market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares. 
05/wsj_0585:"It makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you're going to lose," says Mr. Antolini, of Donaldson Lufkin. 
05/wsj_0585:Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees trading on Nasdaq, agrees that program trading is hurting the market's efforts to bring back small investors.
05/wsj_0585:But, he observes, while makers suffer losses when program trading drags the market down, they also make money when program trading pushes the prices higher. "Sometimes {traders} lose sight of that," he says. 
05/wsj_0585:Three days later, as of Friday's close, the Nasdaq Composite was down 6%, compared with 5.9% for the industrial average, 5.7% for the S&P 500 and 5.8% for the Big Board Composite. 
05/wsj_0585:The main reason for this lag is that individual investors own 65% of the OTC market's capitalization, according to Mr. Hardiman, much more than on the Big Board.
05/wsj_0585:McCaw, which dropped 2 1/2 to 37 3/4, has offered $125 a share for a majority of LIN's shares. 
05/wsj_0585:The revised LIN-BellSouth agreement boosts the dollar amount of the special dividend LIN promises to pay shareholders.
05/wsj_0585:The semiconductor concern said the interruption in shipment of its 80486 computer chip will be brief and have little impact on the company's earnings.
05/wsj_0585:Intel told analysts that the company will resume shipments of the chips within two to three weeks. 
05/wsj_0585:Weisfield's rocketed 9 1/2 to 39 after the jewelry store operator said it is in preliminary discussions, with a party it wouldn't identify, regarding the possible acquisition of the company. 
05/wsj_0585:Starpointe Savings Bank rose 3 to 20 after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved Dime Savings Bank of New York's $21-a-share acquisition of Starpointe. 
05/wsj_0585:Kirschner earned $376,000 on revenue of $14.5 million in the 1988 quarter.
05/wsj_0585:The company blamed a number of factors for the earnings decline, including softer sales of joint-implants. 
05/wsj_0586:London share prices closed sharply lower Friday in active trading after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's resignation slapped the market and Wall Street's rapid initial sell-off knocked it down. 
05/wsj_0586:It showed some early resilience after central bank support firmed sterling, but the weight of Wall Street late in London trading, and signs of further weakness in the British pound, proved a hefty load to bear.
05/wsj_0586:New York stocks recovered some of their losses after the London market closed. 
05/wsj_0586:Dealers said the turnover, largely confined to the 100-share index stocks, partly reflected the flurry of activity typical at the close of a two-week trading account and the start of a new account.
05/wsj_0586:But they said Friday's focus on the top-tier stocks telegraphed active overseas selling and showed the broad-based fears over the status of the U.K. economy and Britain's currency in the wake of the upheaval in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's cabinet. 
05/wsj_0586:A senior dealer with Warburg Securities noted British Gas, the most active blue-chip stock at 20 million shares traded, was affected by the political implications of Mr. Lawson's departure and Mrs. Thatcher's cabinet shuffle. 
05/wsj_0586:He attributed the unusually high volume to broad-based selling on fears that the Thatcher government may be in turmoil and Britain's Labor Party positioned to regain control of the government and renew efforts at nationalization. 
05/wsj_0586:Besides British Gas, British Steel skidded 1.74 to 123.5 on turnover of 11 million shares. 
05/wsj_0586:Shell eased 1 to 416 on turnover of 4.8 million shares. 
05/wsj_0586:On Friday, the Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was down 15.82 at 2681.76.
05/wsj_0586:Fund managers said Friday's profittaking was a natural result of the week's "abnormal fever" in buying real estate, shipbuilding, steel and construction shares. 
05/wsj_0586:Frankfurt prices closed lower again Friday, the fourth decline in the past five days and the culmination of a week that saw the DAX index lose 4%.
05/wsj_0586:Traders said that selling pressure wasn't enormous and that the DAX dropped Friday more on a lack of any substantial buying interest.
05/wsj_0586:They said contributing to the downward drift was the fact that many professional traders had chosen to square positions ahead of the weekend. 
05/wsj_0586:Traders said the market remains extremely nervous because of the wild swings seen on the New York Stock Exchange last week.
05/wsj_0586:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
05/wsj_0586:Last week's best and worst performing stocks among those issues that make up 80% of the world's stock market capitalization (in local currency) 
05/wsj_0587:More than 70,000 people filled a soccer stadium on the outskirts of the black township of Soweto and welcomed freed leaders of the outlawed African National Congress.
05/wsj_0587:Pretoria's approval of the demonstration and the ANC's conciliatory tone appeared aimed at setting up negotiations to give blacks political rights. 
05/wsj_0587:CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS BACKED Bush's criticism of Nicaragua's Ortega. 
05/wsj_0587:While lawmakers haven't raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the Contras following Ortega's weekend threat to end a truce, Senate Majority Leader Mitchell said on NBC-TV that Ortega had made "a very unwise move." Minority Leader Dole plans to offer a resolution tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan president, whose remarks came during a celebration in Costa Rica marking regional moves to democracy.
05/wsj_0587:With all the votes counted, a government spokesman said Prime Minister Gonzalez's party won 176 seats in the 350-seat Cortes, or lower house of parliament.
05/wsj_0587:Thousands of East Germans attended public rallies organized by the Communist leadership and demanded free speech, controls on the security forces and an end to official privileges.
05/wsj_0587:The gatherings in East Berlin and elsewhere were viewed as part of a government effort to stop activists from staging protests to press their demands.
05/wsj_0587:More than 10,000 demonstrators had called for free elections and the resignation of Communist Party leader Milos Jakes.
05/wsj_0587:Federal investigators have determined a metallurgical flaw that developed during the making of an engine disk led to the July crash of a United Airlines jetliner in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 112 people. 
05/wsj_0587:U.S. and Soviet officials are to open a new round of talks today aimed at reducing chemical-weapons arsenals amid superpower differences over whether to stop making the gases.
05/wsj_0587:Afghan guerrillas bombarded Kabul in a weekend assault that Western diplomats called one of the biggest offensives since the Soviet Union completed a troop withdrawal in February.
05/wsj_0587:Lebanon's Christian leader convened an emergency meeting of his cabinet after indications that he might dissolve Parliament in an attempt to scuttle an Arab-sponsored peace plan.
05/wsj_0587:Authorities in Hawaii said the wreckage of a missing commuter plane with 20 people aboard was spotted in a remote valley on the island of Molokai.
05/wsj_0587:There wasn't any evidence of survivors.
05/wsj_0587:The plane failed to reach Molokai's airport Saturday while on a flight from the neighboring island of Maui. 
05/wsj_0587:Died: Rudolf von Bennigsen-Foerder, 63, chairman of Veba AG of West Germany, in Duesseldorf, of pneumonia. 
05/wsj_0588:The West German machinery and plant equipment industry's orders rose an inflation-adjusted 1% in September from a year earlier despite a sharp drop in foreign orders, the German Association of Machinery Makers said. 
05/wsj_0589:Members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously; their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions.
05/wsj_0589:That acquisition, to be completed by year end, will include the Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines, making P&G the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets. 
05/wsj_0589:It's not so much the idea of acquisitions that has agitated the cosmetics industry as the companies doing the acquiring: P&G and Unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper, sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout, sparking fear.
05/wsj_0589:But industry watchers expect them to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies.
05/wsj_0589:Estee Lauder Inc., Revlon Inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives.
05/wsj_0589:"Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods, it doesn't mean they are packaged goods," says Leonard Lauder, chief executive of Estee Lauder. "They're really fashion items wrapped up in little jars." 
05/wsj_0589:In contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses, Unilever and P&G are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits.
05/wsj_0589:P&G already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business.
05/wsj_0589:Consider Oil of Olay, which P&G acquired as part of Richardson-Vicks International in 1985.
05/wsj_0589:The moisturizer, introduced in 1962, had a dowdy image. "Oil of Olay brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older women who had already aged," says David Williams, a consultant with New England Consulting Group. 
05/wsj_0589:It also redesigned Oil of Olay's packaging, stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more opulent look.
05/wsj_0589:Next year, Noxell plans to roll out a perfume called Navy, says George L. Bunting Jr., chairman of Noxell.
05/wsj_0589:The presence of Unilever and P&G is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics.
05/wsj_0589:While the two are among the world's biggest advertisers, most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads.
05/wsj_0589:Estee Lauder, for example, spends only an estimated 5% of sales on advertising in the U.S., and Mr. Lauder says he has no plans to change his strategy. 
05/wsj_0589:Nearly 70% of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets, according to Andrew Shore, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
05/wsj_0589:This fall, for example, L'Oreal Group, ordinarily a high-end line, rolled out a drug-store line of skin-care products called Plenitude, which retail for $5 to $15. 
05/wsj_0589:The packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products.
05/wsj_0589:Sales of its Tide detergent soared earlier this year, for example, after P&G introduced a version that includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics. 
05/wsj_0589:That's led industry executives to speculate that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands. "There will be more emphasis on quality," says Guy Peyrelongue, chief executive of Cosmair Inc., the U.S. licensee of L'Oreal. "You'll see fewer gimmicks." 
05/wsj_0589:The ritzy world of department-store cosmetics retailing, where Unilever is concentrating its efforts, may prove even more treacherous.
05/wsj_0589:Because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned, careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important.
05/wsj_0590:There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the White House and Congress over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad. 
05/wsj_0590:After years of mistrust born of Watergate, past misdeeds of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Iran-Contra scandal, President Bush and the Senate Intelligence Committee appear ready -- for now, at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities.
05/wsj_0590:If that attitude lasts, it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that hasn't been seen in years. 
05/wsj_0590:Over the past week, the president has agreed to keep the committee informed, usually in advance, of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing.
05/wsj_0590:Despite objections by the CIA, Mr. Bush also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the CIA who would be independent of the CIA director. 
05/wsj_0590:In return, the Senate panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within 48 hours of the launching of any covert activity.
05/wsj_0590:It also has removed a ban on CIA use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the CIA didn't get back in the assassination game. 
05/wsj_0590:The new understanding didn't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light.
05/wsj_0590:It emerged after a rancorous display of old-style intelligence politics that followed this month's failed coup attempt in Panama. 
05/wsj_0590:Mr. Bush even disclosed privately that one Reagan-era deal with Congress required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega, if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life.
05/wsj_0590:Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren (D., Okla.) and Vice Chairman William Cohen (R., Maine), for their part, angrily accused the White House of selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to Congress for the bungled attempt to topple Gen. Noriega. 
05/wsj_0590:The White House got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative Republicans who don't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities.
05/wsj_0590:Sen. Boren happily told reporters that there had been "a meeting of the minds" with the White House, and that the committee had given Mr. Bush "a clean slate," free of the impediments imposed during the Reagan years.
05/wsj_0590:And a pending Justice Department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled. 
05/wsj_0590:Some conservatives will accuse the president of promising Congress too much.
05/wsj_0590:Boren and Cohen of wimping out, and they will warn that the lawmakers' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and the Iran arms sales. 
05/wsj_0591:Several of the New York Stock Exchange's own listed companies, led by giant Contel Corp., are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange's role in it. 
05/wsj_0591:The group will complain to Washington, to the heads of program-trading firms and to the heads of the Big Board itself, he said. 
05/wsj_0591:"They should call {the exchange} Trump East," charged Mr. Wohlstetter, the 79-year-old founder of Contel who's also a former investment banker and stock trader. "What is the mission of the financial community -- to help some scavengers or schemers, or help corporate America?" Contel is a $6 billion telephone and electronics company. 
05/wsj_0591:The market's Friday-the-13th plunge of 190 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Big Board's understated response to it, galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among companies listed on the exchange.
05/wsj_0591:Last month, program trading accounted for a record 13.8% of average daily Big Board volume. 
05/wsj_0591:The focus of the outcry has been stock-index arbitrage, which accounts for about half the program trading that goes on.
05/wsj_0591:Privately, exchange officials worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at the Big Board, billions of dollars in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such as London's.
05/wsj_0591:One intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers, according to the exchange. 
05/wsj_0591:The Big Board can't ban stock-index futures, of course, but it could ban use of its high-speed electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off.
05/wsj_0591:The exchange put a bit of a damper on program trading when, last year, it simply started to publish monthly statistics of each firm's program-trading volume. 
05/wsj_0591:Contel's Mr. Wohlstetter said the group of Big Board companies isn't ready to go public yet with its effort, and that he doesn't plan to be the leader once it is public.
05/wsj_0591:Among those Mr. Wohlstetter said he has been talking to are Sanford Weill of Primerica Corp., which is the parent of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.; GTE Corp. 's James Johnson, and ITT Corp. 's Rand Araskog. 
05/wsj_0591:None of these chief executives were available for comment. 
05/wsj_0591:Among the targets of the Big Board companies' campaign will be some corporate pension funds that use program-trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments.
05/wsj_0591:For Contel's part, the company a month ago informed each of its money managers that it would drop them if they give business to program-trading firms. 
05/wsj_0591:It was just those kinds of ultimatums that last week succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate.
05/wsj_0591:All of the firms except Kidder, which is the second-biggest program trader on Wall Street, quickly announced pull-backs from index arbitrage. 
05/wsj_0591:Kidder officials stand by their aggressive use of program trading.
05/wsj_0591:Chief Executive Officer Michael Carpenter said that despite the outcry even by some of Kidder's own brokers, he believes index arbitrage doesn't have a "negative impact on the market as a whole." However, pressure on Kidder's parent, GE, could change Kidder's policy.
05/wsj_0592:As the air clears from last week's storm of resignations and reshufflings, the government faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its policies.
05/wsj_0592:The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer, the untested John Major, need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again.
05/wsj_0592:It sounds like the work of a decade, but the deadline is late 1991, when Mrs. Thatcher is expected to call another national election.
05/wsj_0592:What's worrying her supporters is that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable.
05/wsj_0592:Though Mrs. Thatcher has pulled through other crises, supporters wonder if her steely, autocratic ways are the right formula today. "There's a rising fear that perhaps Mrs. Thatcher's style of management has become a political liability," says Bill Martin, senior economist at London brokers UBS-Phillips & Drew. 
05/wsj_0592:The prime minister's insistence on keeping a private coterie of advisers -- including an economic guru who openly criticized former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson -- confused the financial community.
05/wsj_0592:Last week, the strategy of playing the two experts off each other blew up: Mr. Lawson quit in exasperation and Sir Alan Walters, the adviser, announced his resignation within an hour. 
05/wsj_0592:Though Mrs. Thatcher doesn't need to call an election until June 1992, she would prefer doing so in late 1991. "If the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year's time, she will be very vulnerable," says John Barnes, a lecturer at the London School of Economics. 
05/wsj_0592:There's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the European Community.
05/wsj_0592:It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which links the major EC currencies.
05/wsj_0592:Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan, the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue.
05/wsj_0592:Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt authorities move interest rates.
05/wsj_0592:As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis, many harbor hopes last week's debacle will prompt change. "We won't have any more of this wayward behavior," says Sir Peter Hordern, a backbench Tory member of Parliament. "The party is fed up with sackings of good people." 
05/wsj_0593:Joseph L. Dionne, chairman and chief executive officer of McGraw-Hill Inc., was elected to the board of directors of this electronics manufacturer.
05/wsj_0594:the state of the art, 
05/wsj_0595:Rand Corp. researchers Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider analyzed a large sample of married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and 18.
05/wsj_0595:Not unexpectedly, wives, whether working or non-working, did by far the most -- about 80% of the shopping, laundry and cooking, and about two-thirds of housecleaning, washing dishes, child care and family paper work.
05/wsj_0595:"It is clear," Ms. Waite says, "that most of the effect of increasing education has been to shift who is helping the wife/mother.
05/wsj_0595:Conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from one-fourth to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for Medicaid assistance.
05/wsj_0595:But separate reports from Joshua Weiner and Denise Spence of the Brookings Institution and Korbin Liu of the Urban Institute find that "a surprisingly small proportion" -- only about 10% -- of residents start out as private payers but "spend down" to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged. (Another one-third are already on Medicaid when they enter the nursing homes, a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated.) 
05/wsj_0595:About one-third pay out of their own pockets, while the rest are covered throughout by Medicare, private insurers or the Veterans Administration.
05/wsj_0595:The Brookings and Urban Institute authors caution, however, that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration, and reaching the Medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays.
05/wsj_0595:THE REAGAN generation young men and women reaching political maturity during Ronald Reagan's presidency -- are firmly liberal on race and gender, according to NORC, the social science research center at the University of Chicago. 
05/wsj_0595:For example, 66% of the 18 to 24 year olds in the four latest surveys favored an "open housing" law prohibiting homeowners from refusing on racial grounds to sell to prospective buyers.
05/wsj_0595:That compares with 58% of the similar age group in the 1980 through 1982 surveys and 55% in the 1972 through 1975 surveys. 
05/wsj_0595:Asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the claim that men are emotionally better suited to politics than women, 70% of the Reagan generation disagreed, compared with under 60% of younger men and women in the earlier years.
05/wsj_0595:SEPARATED and divorced men and women are far more likely to be smokers than married persons, the Centers for Disease Control discovers. . . . Graduate students are taking longer than ever to get their doctor of philosophy degrees, the National Research Council says.
05/wsj_0595:It estimates the time between college graduation and the awarding of a Ph. D. has lengthened by 30% over the past 20 years, with the average gap now ranging from about 7.4 years in the physical sciences to 16.2 years in education. 
05/wsj_0596:October was an edgy month for the practitioners of glasnost, the official Soviet policy of allowing more candor from the nation's media.
05/wsj_0596:For one of the superstars of glasnost, Vitaly Korotich, editor of the trail-blazing weekly Ogonyok, Friday, Oct. 20 was a somersaulting day that turned from tension to elation. 
05/wsj_0596:He had been summoned to the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, after he finished his lunch at the Savoy Hotel, an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic brow-beating: Eight-foot-tall Rubenesquely naked ladies float on their canvases toward a ceiling teeming with cherubs, all surrounded by gilt laid on with a pastry chef's trowel and supported by marble corinthian columns whose capitals are fluting fountains of gold. 
05/wsj_0596:And indeed, as he later reported, that was the import of the meeting.
05/wsj_0596:Anxious allies of President Mikhail Gorbachev are cautioning media leaders to take it easy, to be careful not to do anything that could be used by Mr. Gorbachev's opponents.
05/wsj_0596:According to Mr. Korotich, who was present, Mr. Gorbachev's publicized tongue-lashing of the press on Oct. 13 was more of a plea: "Be careful boys; use good judgment.
05/wsj_0596:The day after that conversation at the residence of the U.S. ambassador, the Brezhnevite editor of Pravda, Victor Afnasjev, was replaced by a college classmate of Mr. Gorbachev's.
05/wsj_0596:At the end of the very week in which Mr. Korotich was called to the Central Committee, Ogonyok was again demonstrating its independence by printing a poll that showed that 35% of the Soviet population, a plurality, believed that Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms, perestroika, would result in only insignificant change. 
05/wsj_0596:A good measurement of the popularity of ice-breaker journals like Ogonyok is circulation.
05/wsj_0596:Pravda, meanwhile, has retained only 57% of its 1986 readership. 
05/wsj_0596:Glasnost has made celebrities of men like Mr. Korotich.
05/wsj_0596:Prevented by the Communist Party from getting on its slate of nominees for the new Supreme Soviet, he stood as an independent candidate for Congress from his native Ukraine and won with 84% of the vote.
05/wsj_0596:The same evening that he was summoned for a warning from the Party, he was cheered by thousands of his supporters at a rally of what can only be called the Korotich party. 
05/wsj_0596:As late as the 1890s, the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines.
05/wsj_0596:It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan's wives.
05/wsj_0596:So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society.
05/wsj_0596:It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history.
05/wsj_0596:It is public relations of the highest sophistication, that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point. 
05/wsj_0596:Will Ogonyok begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika? "I'd be destroying myself," replies Mr. Korotich, who then asks, "What would that accomplish?" His answer reveals his vulnerability -- it also draws the line that Soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of Western culture.
05/wsj_0596:It is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even admirable leaders. 
05/wsj_0596:Mr. Ayers is editor and publisher of the Anniston, Ala., Star. 
05/wsj_0597:A state trial judge in Illinois gave preliminary approval to a proposed settlement of a suit against a Bank of New York Co. unit, Irving Trust Co., over the interest rates on Irving's former One Wall Street Account money-market deposit accounts. 
05/wsj_0597:Judge Albert Green, in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, also recognized the suit, filed last May by Robert and Cynthia Langendorf, as a class action covering thousands of Irving customers.
05/wsj_0597:The plaintiffs accused Irving of paying less interest than promised in a marketing brochure.
05/wsj_0597:A Bank of New York spokesman in Manhattan, Owen Brady, said, "That's the maximum, outside figure." 
05/wsj_0598:Federal Reserve critics used to complain of "stop and go" monetary policies.
05/wsj_0598:He fusses endlessly over economic statistics, dissecting them in dozens of ways, probing for hours in search of potential problems.
05/wsj_0598:After thoroughly digesting reams of information, he often concludes that more data are needed, and when he finally decides to act, his movements sometimes seem excrutiatingly small. 
05/wsj_0598:Some Bush administration officials urged Mr. Greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets.
05/wsj_0598:At a hearing last week, Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that "Chairman Greenspan's" announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a "very important statement." Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he wasn't sure whether Mr. Greenspan "made a statement himself, or whether that was a newspaper report." 
05/wsj_0598:A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system.
05/wsj_0598:And, by the end of that week, the key federal funds interest rate, which is largely controlled by the Fed, had settled at 8.75%, barely changed from the level of just under 9% that prevailed the previous week. 
05/wsj_0598:Signs of growing weakness in the economy, paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control, have caused them to wonder why the Fed chairman is so grudging in reducing rates. 
05/wsj_0598:In fact, the administration and the Fed have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to dispel any impression that they are at odds, fearing stories about an administration-Fed split added to the stock market's jitters.
05/wsj_0598:The economy is showing signs of weakness, particularly among manufacturers.
05/wsj_0598:But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant to loosen policy, partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks who oppose credit easing.
05/wsj_0598:His hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession. "We've gotten through two stock market crashes, and we've gone through an election without any major problems," says David Hale, an economist of Kemper Financial Services. "I think you have to give Greenspan a good rating."

06/wsj_0601:In an age of specialization, the federal judiciary is one of the last bastions of the generalist.
06/wsj_0601:But even on the federal bench, specialization is creeping in, and it has become a subject of sharp controversy on the newest federal appeals court. 
06/wsj_0601:The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was created in 1982 to serve, among other things, as the court of last resort for most patent disputes.
06/wsj_0601:Previously, patent cases moved through the court system to one of the 12 circuit appeals courts.
06/wsj_0601:There, judges who saw few such cases and had no experience in the field grappled with some of the most technical and complex disputes imaginable. 
06/wsj_0601:Now only three of the 12 judges -- Pauline Newman, Chief Judge Howard T. Markey, 68, and Giles Rich, 85 -- have patent-law backgrounds.
06/wsj_0601:Some of the associations have recommended Dr. Alan D. Lourie, 54, a former patent agent with a doctorate in organic chemistry who now is associate general counsel with SmithKline Beckman Corp. in Philadelphia.
06/wsj_0601:The Justice Department's view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court, Judge H. Robert Mayer, a former civil litigator who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to the Federal Circuit two years ago. "I believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law," Judge Mayer says, adding that "it's the responsibility of highly paid lawyers (who argue before the court) to make us understand (complex patent litigation)." 
06/wsj_0601:Medtronic, Inc., the patent infringement case the Supreme Court this month agreed to review, as an example of poor legal reasoning by judges who lack patent litigation experience. (Judge Mayer was not on the three-member panel.) 
06/wsj_0601:If the Supreme Court holds in Medtronic's favor, the decision will have billion-dollar consequences for the manufacturers of medical devices, color and food additives and all other non-drug products that required Food & Drug Administration approval. 
06/wsj_0601:Lisa Raines, a lawyer and director of government relations for the Industrial Biotechnical Association, contends that a judge well-versed in patent law and the concerns of research-based industries would have ruled otherwise.
06/wsj_0601:And Judge Newman, a former patent lawyer, wrote in her dissent when the court denied a motion for a rehearing of the case by the full court, "The panel's judicial legislation has affected an important high-technological industry, without regard to the consequences for research and innovation or the public interest." 
06/wsj_0601:Says Ms. Raines, "(The judgment) confirms our concern that the absence of patent lawyers on the court could prove troublesome."

06/wsj_0604:Only a few months ago, the 124-year-old securities firm seemed to be on the verge of a meltdown, racked by internal squabbles and defections.
06/wsj_0604:By the end of this year, 63-year-old Chairman Silas Cathcart -- the former chairman of Illinois Tool Works who was derided as a "tool-and-die man" when GE brought him in to clean up Kidder in 1987 -- retires to his Lake Forest, Ill., home, possibly to build a shopping mall on some land he owns. "I've done what I came to do" at Kidder, he says. 
06/wsj_0604:And that means 42-year-old Michael Carpenter, president and chief executive since January, will for the first time take complete control of Kidder and try to make good on some grandiose plans.
06/wsj_0604:Through the first nine months of the year, Kidder ranks a distant 10th among underwriters of U.S. stocks and bonds, with a 2.8% market share, up slightly from 2.5% in the year-earlier period, according to Securities Data Co.
06/wsj_0604:Gary S. Goldstein, president of the Whitney Group, an executive search firm, said: "I'd like to see (Kidder) succeed.
06/wsj_0604:In 1988, Kidder eked out a $46 million profit, mainly because of severe cost cutting.
06/wsj_0604:Mr. Carpenter, a former consulting-firm executive who has a love for "task forces," says he has done a "complete rethink" of Kidder in recent months.
06/wsj_0604:There have been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm's operations.
06/wsj_0604:Mr. Carpenter says that when he assumes full control, Kidder will finally tap the resources of GE.
06/wsj_0604:One of GE's goals when it bought 80% of Kidder in 1986 was to take advantage of "syngeries" between Kidder and General Electric Capital Corp., GE's corporate-finance unit, which has $42 billion in assets.
06/wsj_0604:The leveraged buy-out group of GE Capital now reports to Mr. Carpenter. 
06/wsj_0604:So far, instead of teaming up, GE Capital staffers and Kidder investment bankers have bickered.
06/wsj_0604:Yet, says Mr. Carpenter, "We've really started to exploit the synergy between GE Capital and Kidder Peabody." The units have worked on 37 investment banking deals this year, he says, though not all of them have panned out. 
06/wsj_0604:A month ago, the firm started serving dinner at about 7:30 each night; about 50 to 60 of the 350 people in the investment banking operation have consistently been around that late. "We are working significantly longer and harder than has been the case in the past," says Scott C. Newquist, Kidder's head of investment banking since June. 
06/wsj_0604:The firm's new head of mergers and acquisitions under Mr. Newquist, B.J. Megargel, talks of the opportunity to "rebuild a franchise" at Kidder. "The Kidder name is one of only six or seven that every CEO recognizes as a viable alternative" when considering a merger deal, he says.
06/wsj_0604:Mr. Carpenter this month sold off Kidder's eight brokerage offices in Florida and Puerto Rico to Merrill Lynch & Co., refueling speculation that Kidder is getting out of the brokerage business entirely.
06/wsj_0604:The result: Kidder will focus on rich individual investors and small companies, much closer to the clientele of Goldman, Sachs & Co. than a serve-the-world firm like Merrill Lynch or Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Mr. Carpenter notes that these types of investors also are "sophisticated" enough not to complain about Kidder's aggressive use of program trading. 
06/wsj_0604:As part of the upscale push, Kidder is putting brokers through a 20-week training course, turning them into "investment counselors" with knowledge of corporate finance.
06/wsj_0604:However, skeptics caution that this kind of cross-pollination between brokers and investment bankers looks great on paper, but doesn't always happen. 
06/wsj_0604:Mr. Cathcart, who will return to the Quaker Oats Co. board of directors, in addition to his personal ventures, is credited with bringing some basic budgeting and planning discipline to traditionally free-wheeling Kidder.
06/wsj_0604:Mr. Cathcart says he has had "a lot of fun" at Kidder, adding the crack about his being a "tool-and-die man" never bothered him. "It was an absolutely marvelous line and one I used many times," he says. 
06/wsj_0604:Smiling broadly when he talks about Mr. Carpenter, Mr. Cathcart says the new Kidder chief is "going to be recognized shortly as one of the real leaders in the investment-banking business." In coming years, Mr. Cathcart says, Kidder is "gonna hum." 
06/wsj_0606:In what could prove a major addition to the Philippines' foreign-investment portfolio, a Taiwanese company signed a $180 million construction contract to build the centerpiece of a planned petrochemical complex. 
06/wsj_0606:Mr. Lee, president of Luzon Petrochemical Corp., said the contract was signed Wednesday in Tokyo with USI Far East officials.
06/wsj_0606:The complex is to be located in Batangas, about 70 miles south of Manila. 
06/wsj_0606:USI Far East will hold a 60% stake in Luzon Petrochemical, according to papers signed with the Philippine government's Board of Investments. 
06/wsj_0606:The project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade. 
06/wsj_0606:As previously reported, a member of the Philippines' House of Representatives has sued to stop the plant.
06/wsj_0606:The legislator, Enrique Garcia, had actively backed the plant, but at the original site in his constituency northwest of Manila.
06/wsj_0606:However, at a news conference Thursday, Mrs. Aquino backed the project and said her government was attempting to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site, adjacent to the government's major petroleum refinery in Bataan province. "We have tried our best to tell the people in Bataan that maybe this time it will not go to them, but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province," Mrs. Aquino told Manila-based foreign correspondents.

06/wsj_0609:President Bush insists it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and slicing the lard out of government programs.
06/wsj_0609:Not so fast, says Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, a fellow Republican. "I consider it one of the stupidest ideas of the 20th century," he says. 
06/wsj_0609:Whatever one thinks of the idea, it's far more than the budgetary gimmick it may seem at first glance.
06/wsj_0609:Rather, it's a device that could send shock waves through the president's entire relationship with Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress, fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business. 
06/wsj_0609:Although that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside Washington, it would set off a political earthquake. "The ramifications are enormous," says Rep. Don Edwards, a California Democrat who is a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. "It's a real face-to-face arm wrestling challenge to Congress." 
06/wsj_0609:Still, Mr. Bush and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto.
06/wsj_0609:Mr. Bush, former President Reagan and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process.
06/wsj_0609:They base their argument on a clause buried in Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution that states: "Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him or . . . disapproved by him. . . ." 
06/wsj_0609:Rep. Edwards, the California Democrat, is one who pledges that he would immediately challenge Mr. Bush in the courts, arguing a line-item veto would expand a president's powers far beyond anything the framers of the Constitution had in mind. "It puts this president in the legislative business," he declares. "That's not what our fathers had in mind." 
06/wsj_0609:Big chunks of the government budget, like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare, wouldn't be affected.
06/wsj_0609:Still, proponents contend that the veto would have what Mr. Glazier calls an important "chilling effect" on all manner of appropriations bills.
06/wsj_0609:Lawmakers, they say, would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later. 
06/wsj_0609:Whatever the outcome of a test case, President Bush would have to move cautiously becase the very attempt would "antagonize not just Democrats but Republicans," says Louis Fisher, a scholar at the Congressional Research Service who specializes in executive-legislative relations.
06/wsj_0609:Indeed, although a majority of Republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto, some, ranging from liberal Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield to conservative Rep. Edwards are opposed.
06/wsj_0609:Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person.
06/wsj_0609:"Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill." 
06/wsj_0610:The company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions.
06/wsj_0610:Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg.
06/wsj_0610:Analysts say much of Kellogg's erosion has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes, which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume.
06/wsj_0610:"Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios have eaten away sales normally going to Kellogg's corn-based lines simply because they are made of oats," says Merrill Lynch food analyst William Maguire. "They are not a happy group of people at Battle Creek right now." Kellogg is based in Battle Creek, Mich., a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world. 
06/wsj_0610:Another analyst, John C. Maxwell Jr. of Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, Va., recently went to a "sell" recommendation on Kellogg stock, which closed Friday at $71.75, down 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. "I don't think Kellogg can get back to 40% this year," he said. "Kellogg's main problem is life style.
06/wsj_0610:A Kellogg officer, who asked not to be named, said the Memphis project was "pulled in for a reconsideration of costs," an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction.
06/wsj_0610:The company had retained the Fluor Daniel unit of Fluor Corp. as general contractor. 
06/wsj_0610:Fluor Daniel already has reassigned most of its work crew, the sources said. 
06/wsj_0610:Until recently, Kellogg had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume. 
06/wsj_0610:Last year, the company earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion. 
06/wsj_0610:The company had a one-time charge of $14.8 million in the latest quarter covering the disposition of certain assets.
06/wsj_0612:Sun Microsystems Inc. -- $125 million of 6 3/8% convertible subordinated debentures due Oct. 15, 1999, priced at 84.90 to yield 7.51%.
06/wsj_0612:Hertz Corp. -- $100 million of senior notes due Nov. 1, 2009, priced at par to yield 9%.
06/wsj_0612:The issue, which is puttable back to the company in 1999, was priced at a spread of 110 basis points above the Treasury's 10-year note.
06/wsj_0612:Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (Canada) -- 10 billion yen of 5.7% bonds due Nov. 17, 1992, priced at 101 1/4 to yield 5.75% less full fees, via LTCB International Ltd. Fees 1 3/8. 
06/wsj_0613:On Friday, Datuk Daim added spice to an otherwise unremarkable address on Malaysia's proposed budget for 1990 by ordering the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange "to take appropriate action immediately" to cut its links with the Stock Exchange of Singapore. 
06/wsj_0613:The delisting of Malaysian-based companies from the Singapore exchange may not be a smooth process, analysts say.

06/wsj_0616:As competition heats up in Spain's crowded bank market, Banco Exterior de Espana is seeking to shed its image of a state-owned bank and move into new activities. 
06/wsj_0616:Under the direction of its new chairman, Francisco Luzon, Spain's seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring that analysts say may be the first step toward the bank's privatization. 
06/wsj_0616:The state-owned industrial holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly hold a 13.94% stake in Banco Exterior.
06/wsj_0616:Instead, they are working to transform Banco Exterior into an efficient bank by the end of 1992. "I want this to be a model of the way a public-owned company should be run," Mr. Luzon says. 
06/wsj_0616:At the same time, many of Spain's traditional export markets in Latin America and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth. 
06/wsj_0616:As a result, the volume of Banco Exterior's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ($7.04 billion) as of Dec. 31, 1986, to its current 522 billion pesetas. 
06/wsj_0616:The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs. 
06/wsj_0616:The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government, analysts say.
06/wsj_0616:But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy, cut costs, increase capital and build up new areas of business. 
06/wsj_0616:Though Spain has an excess of banks, analysts say the country still has one of the most profitable markets in Europe, which will aid Banco Exterior with the tough tasks it faces ahead. 
06/wsj_0616:Banco Exterior was one of the last banks to create a brokerage house before the four Spanish stock exchanges underwent sweeping changes in July.
06/wsj_0616:But Mr. Luzon contends that the experienced team he brought with him from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, where he was formerly director general, will whip the bank's capital market division into shape by the end of 1992.
06/wsj_0617:General Motors Corp. 's general counsel hopes to cut the number of outside law firms the auto maker uses from about 700 to 200 within two years. 
06/wsj_0617:The move is consistent with a trend for corporate legal staffs to do more work in-house, instead of farming it out to law firms.
06/wsj_0617:Among the types of cases the in-house litigators handle are disputes involving companies doing business with GM and product-related actions, including one in which a driver is suing GM for damages resulting from an accident. 
06/wsj_0617:Mr. Pearce says law firms with the best chance of retaining or winning business with GM will be those providing the highest-quality service at the best cost -- echoing similar directives from GM's auto operations to suppliers. 
06/wsj_0617:This doesn't necessarily mean larger firms have an advantage; Mr. Pearce said GM works with a number of smaller firms it regards highly.
06/wsj_0617:That's a finding of a new study of the Justice Department by researchers at Syracuse University.
06/wsj_0617:David Burnham, one of the authors, says fewer trials probably means a growing number of plea bargains.
06/wsj_0617:In 1980, 18% of federal prosecutions concluded at trial; in 1987, only 9% did. 
06/wsj_0617:The Justice Department rejected the implication that its prosecutors are currently more willing to plea bargain. "Our felony caseloads have been consistent for 20 years," with about 15% of all prosecutions going to trial, a department spokeswoman said.
06/wsj_0617:"One possible explanation for this decline" in taking cases to trial, says Mr. Burnham, "is that the number of defendants being charged with crimes by all U.S. attorneys has substantially increased." 
06/wsj_0617:On the civil side, the Manhattan prosecutor filed an average of only 11 cases for every 100,000 adults during the same period; the San Francisco U.S. attorney averaged 79. 
06/wsj_0617:The former first lady of the Philippines, asked a federal court in Manhattan to dismiss an indictment against her, claiming among other things, that she was abducted from her homeland.
06/wsj_0617:Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, were charged with embezzling more than $100 million from that country and then fraudulently concealing much of the money through purchases of prime real estate in Manhattan. 
06/wsj_0617:The prosecutor quoted statements from the Marcoses in which they said they were in this country at the invitation of President Reagan and that they were enjoying the hospitality of the U.S. 
06/wsj_0617:THE FEDERAL COURT of appeals in Manhattan ruled that the dismissal of a 1980 indictment against former Bank of Crete owner George Koskotas should be reconsidered.
06/wsj_0617:He made numerous trips to the U.S. in the early 1980s, but wasn't arrested until 1987 when he showed up as a guest of then-Vice President George Bush at a government function.
06/wsj_0617:The appeals court, however, said the judge didn't adequately consider whether the delay would actually hurt the chances of a fair trial.
06/wsj_0617:Mr. Koskotas is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece, where he is charged with embezzling more than $250 million from the Bank of Crete.
06/wsj_0617:PRO BONO VOLUNTARISM: In an effort to stave off a plan that would require all lawyers in New York state to provide twenty hours of free legal aid a year, the state bar recommended an alternative program to increase voluntary participation in pro bono programs.
06/wsj_0617:The state bar association's policy making body, the House of Delegate, voted Saturday to ask Chief Judge Sol Wachtler to give the bar's voluntary program three years to prove its effectiveness before considering mandatory pro bono. "We believe our suggested plan is more likely to improve the availability of quality legal service to the poor than is the proposed mandatory pro bono plan and will achieve that objective without the divisiveness, distraction, administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear would accompany an attempt to impose a mandatory plan," said Justin L. Vigdor of Rochester, who headed the bar's pro bono study committee. 
06/wsj_0617:The merger must be formally approved by the partners of both firms but is expected to be completed by year end.
06/wsj_0617:He seeks damages from the company's 15 directors on grounds that they either "participated in or condoned the illegal acts . . . or utterly failed to carry out their duties as directors." GE is defending itself against government criminal charges of fraud and false claims in connection with a logistics-computer contract for the Army.
06/wsj_0617:The government's assertions of the cover-up were made in last minute pretrial motions.
06/wsj_0617:GE, which vehemently denies the government's allegations, denounced Mr. Greenfield's suit. "It is a cheap-shot suit -- procedurally defective and thoroughly fallacious -- which was hurriedly filed by a contingency-fee lawyer as a result of newspaper reports," said a GE spokeswoman.
06/wsj_0618:The head of the nation's largest car-dealers group is telling dealers to "just say no" when auto makers pressure them to stockpile cars on their lots. 
06/wsj_0618:In an open letter that will run today in the trade journal Automotive News, Ron Tonkin, president of the National Car Dealers Association, says dealers should cut their inventories to no more than half the level traditionally considered desirable. 
06/wsj_0618:Mr. Tonkin, who has been feuding with the Big Three since he took office earlier this year, said that with half of the nation's dealers losing money or breaking even, it was time for "emergency action." 
06/wsj_0618:U.S. car dealers had an average of 59 days' supply of cars in their lots at the end of September, according to Ward's Automotive Reports.
06/wsj_0618:But Mr. Tonkin said dealers should slash stocks to between 15 and 30 days to reduce the costs of financing inventory. 
06/wsj_0618:His message is getting a chilly reception in Detroit, where the Big Three auto makers are already being forced to close plants because of soft sales and reduced dealer orders.
06/wsj_0619:Southern Co. 's Gulf Power Co. unit may plead guilty this week to charges that it illegally steered company money to politicians through outside vendors, according to individuals close to an investigation of the utility holding company. 
06/wsj_0619:The tentative settlement between Gulf Power, a Pensacola, Fla., electric company, and federal prosecutors would mark the end of one part of a wide-ranging inquiry of Southern Co. in the past year.
06/wsj_0619:The probe of Southern Co. has attracted considerable attention this year because of several events that have befallen the company, including the death of a Gulf Power executive in a plane crash and the disappearance of a company vendor who was to be a key grand jury witness. 
06/wsj_0619:Witnesses have said the grand jury has asked numerous questions about Jacob F. "Jake" Horton, the senior vice president of Gulf Power who died in the plane crash in April.
06/wsj_0619:On the morning of the crash, he had been put on notice that an audit committee was recommending his dismissal because of invoicing irregularities in a company audit.
06/wsj_0620:Exxon Corp. is resigning from the National Wildlife Federation's corporate advisory panel, saying the conservation group has been unfairly critical of the Exxon Valdez oil spill along the Alaskan coast. 
06/wsj_0620:The federation, with 5.8 million members nationwide, has been one of the sharpest critics of Exxon's handling of the 11 million gallon tanker spill and has accused the company of repeatedly ignoring requests to meet and discuss it. 
06/wsj_0620:The March 24 oil spill soiled hundreds of miles of shoreline along Alaska's southern coast and wreaked havoc with wildlife and the fishing industry. 
06/wsj_0620:Exxon's Exxon USA unit was one of the charter members of the Corporate Conservation Council, a panel of executives formed in 1982 by the National Wildlife Federation to foster "frank and open discussions" between industry and the federation's leaders. 
06/wsj_0620:In a letter to the federation, Raymond Campion, Exxon's environmental coordinator, said: "Recent public actions by you regarding the Valdez oil spill have failed to demonstrate any sense of objectivity or fairness." 
06/wsj_0620:The federation was among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in August against Exxon seeking full payment of environmental recovery costs from the spill. 
06/wsj_0621:First Tennessee National Corp. said it would take a $4 million charge in the fourth quarter, as a result of plans to expand its systems operation. 
06/wsj_0621:"Because personal computers will soon be on the desks of all of our tellers, and customer service and loan representatives, information will be instantly available to help customers with product decisions and provide them with information about their accounts," according to John Kelley, executive vice president and corporate services group manager at First Tennessee. 
06/wsj_0622:The Treasury Department said the U.S. trade deficit may worsen next year, after two years of significant improvement. 
06/wsj_0622:In its report to Congress on international economic policies, the Treasury said that any improvement in the broadest measure of trade, known as the current account, "is likely at best to be very modest," and "the possibility of deterioration in the current account next year cannot be excluded." 
06/wsj_0622:The statement was the U.S. government's first acknowledgement of what other groups, such as the International Monetary Fund, have been predicting for months.
06/wsj_0622:The Treasury's report, which is required annually by a provision of the 1988 trade act, again took South Korea to task for its exchange-rate policies. "We believe that there have continued to be indications of exchange-rate `manipulation'" during the past six months, it said, citing the lack of market forces in South Korea's exchange-rate system and the use of capital and interest-rate controls to manipulate exchange rates. 
06/wsj_0622:The Treasury expressed pleasure, however, with the government of Taiwan, which was cited for exchange-rate manipulation in last year's report.
06/wsj_0623:The next time you hear a Member of Congress moan about the deficit, consider what Congress did Friday.
06/wsj_0623:Senator Byrd is chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
06/wsj_0623:For Iowa, a $1.8 million request became $12 million for Senator Grassley, ranking minority member of a military construction subcommittee.
06/wsj_0623:Rep. Jamie Whitten of Mississippi and chairman of House Appropriations turned a $20 million Bush request for his state into a $49.7 million bequest.
06/wsj_0623:Senator Sasser of Tennessee is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on military construction; Mr. Bush's $87 million request for Tennessee increased to $109 million.
06/wsj_0623:In a remark someone should remember this time next year, Senator Sasser said, "I think we've seen the peak of military construction spending for many years to come." 
06/wsj_0623:Tell us what measure, short of house arrest, will get this Congress under control. 
06/wsj_0624:The agreement was announced by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Friday, as President Bush and other leaders from the Western Hemisphere gathered in the Central American nation for a celebration of democracy.
06/wsj_0624:Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the agreement "an important step forward in the strengthened debt strategy," noting that it will "when implemented, provide significant reduction in the level of debt and debt service owed by Costa Rica." 
06/wsj_0624:Under the plan, Costa Rica will buy back roughly 60% of its bank debt outstanding at a deeply discounted price, according to officials involved in the agreement.
06/wsj_0624:The remainder of the debt will be exchanged for new Costa Rican bonds with a 6 1/4% interest rate. 
06/wsj_0625:The Treasury said it plans to sell $2 billion of 51-day cash-management bills today, raising all new cash. 
06/wsj_0625:Tenders, available in minimum denominations of $1 million, must be received by noon EST today at Federal Reserve Banks or branches. 
06/wsj_0625:The Treasury also announced details of this week's unusual bill auction, which has been changed to accommodate the expiration of the federal debt ceiling at midnight tomorrow. 
06/wsj_0625:The Treasury said it won't be able to honor reinvestment requests from holders of bills maturing Nov. 2 held in the Treasury's book-entry system.
06/wsj_0625:The department will make payment for bills maturing on Nov. 2 to all investors who have requested reinvestment of their bills on that date, as well as to all account holders who have previously requested payment. 
06/wsj_0626:American Pioneer, parent of American Pioneer Savings Bank, said the sale will add capital and reduce the level of investments in subsidiaries for the thrift holding company. 
06/wsj_0626:Recently, the boards of both the parent company and the thrift also voted to suspend dividends on preferred shares of both companies and convert all preferred into common shares.
06/wsj_0626:The transaction is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement and approval by various regulatory agencies, including the insurance departments of the states of Florida and Indiana, the company said. 
06/wsj_0626:In the second quarter, American Pioneer reported a loss of $7.3 million, compared with net income of $1.1 million a year earlier.
06/wsj_0626:The banking operation had a loss of $8.7 million in the second quarter, largely because of problem real-estate loans, while the insurance operations earned $884,000. 
06/wsj_0627:But the actual head count of non-farm employment payroll jobs is likely to be muddied by the impact of Hurricane Hugo, strikes, and less-than-perfect seasonal adjustments, economists said. 
06/wsj_0627:The consensus view calls for an overall job gain of 155,000 compared with September's 209,000 increase.
06/wsj_0627:"The employment report is going to be difficult to interpret," said Michael Englund, economist with MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York. 
06/wsj_0627:What's more, he believes seasonal swings in the auto industry this year aren't occurring at the same time as in the past, because of production and pricing differences that are curbing the accuracy of seasonal adjustments built into the employment data. 
06/wsj_0627:Wednesday's report from the purchasing agents will be watched to see if the index maintains a level below 50%, as it has for the past couple of months.
06/wsj_0627:A reading of less than 50% indicates an economy that is generally contracting while a reading above 50% indicates an economy that's expanding. 
06/wsj_0627:Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc., Chicago, said that the purchasers' report is valuable because it often presents the first inkling of economic data for the month.
06/wsj_0627:The consensus view on September leading indicators calls for a gain of 0.3%, the same as in August.
06/wsj_0627:But Mr. Wyss said he will watch the numbers to get an inkling of whether consumers' general buying habits may slack off as much as their auto-buying apparently has.
06/wsj_0628:Factory owners are buying new machinery at a good rate this fall, machine tool makers say, but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks raise questions about fourth-quarter demand from the important automotive industry. 
06/wsj_0628:Domestic machine tool plants received $303 million of orders last month, up 33% from August's $227.1 million, but still below the $328.2 million of September 1988, NMTBA said. 
06/wsj_0628:"September was one of the biggest order months in our history," says James R. Roberts, vice president, world-wide sales and marketing, for Giddings & Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac, Wis.
06/wsj_0628:At a recent meeting of manufacturing executives, "everybody I talked with was very positive," he says.
06/wsj_0628:But sales of North American-made 1990-model cars are running at an annual rate of only six million, down from 7.1 million a year earlier.
06/wsj_0628:There is demand for state-of-the-art machine tools in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries as those nations strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods. 
06/wsj_0628:If that controversy continues, U.S. machine tool makers say, West German and other foreign producers are likely to grab most of the sales in Eastern Europe. 
06/wsj_0628:Shipments have run well ahead of 1988 all year, as machine tool builders produce against relatively good backlogs. 
06/wsj_0628:U.S. producers had a $2.15 billion backlog of unfilled orders at the end of September.
06/wsj_0628:That was up 2.8% from a year earlier, even though orders for the first nine months of 1989 were down 19% from the comparable 1988 period. 
06/wsj_0629:"When they talk mega-issues, they're truly talking mega," says S.A. Dave, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. "The capital market is booming." 
06/wsj_0629:Some of the large amounts are being raised by small firms.
06/wsj_0629:In addition, once money is raised, investors usually have no way of knowing how it is spent. 
06/wsj_0629:Some analysts are concerned that the mega-issues, in such an unregulated environment, could lead to a mega-crash. "The rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects," says G.S. Patel, a former chairman of the giant, government-run mutual fund, the Unit Trust of India. "They're going to have mega-problems." 
06/wsj_0629:This year's biggest issue, $570 million of convertible debentures by engineering company Larsen & Toubro Ltd., is the largest in Indian history.
06/wsj_0629:In the past, the socialist policies of the government strictly limited the size of new steel mills, petrochemical plants, car factories and other industrial concerns to conserve resources and restrict the profits businessmen could make.
06/wsj_0629:As a result, industry operated out of small, expensive, highly inefficient industrial units. 
06/wsj_0629:He said industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside India and benefit from economies of scale.
06/wsj_0629:Some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first fruits of Mr. Gandhi's policy, and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past.
06/wsj_0629:The industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market, which is a far cheaper source of funds than government-controlled banks, where interest rates for prime borrowers are around 16%. 
06/wsj_0629:Some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than Mr. Gandhi's, and possibly more restrictive. 
06/wsj_0629:The buoyant Bombay rumor mill also says that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections.
06/wsj_0629:No one admits to anything, but India's industrialists have a history of making under-the-table campaign donations. 
06/wsj_0629:Earlier this year, Tata Iron & Steel Co. 's offer of $355 million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed.
06/wsj_0629:While many investors are selling parts of their portfolios to buy the new issues, prices on India's 16 stock exchanges are holding up so far. 
06/wsj_0629:"I don't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market," says Mr. Patel, "only a sagging tendency." Says M.J. Pherwani, chairman of the Unit Trust of India: The "markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before." 
06/wsj_0629:Various ministries decided the products businessmen could produce and how much; and government-owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans. 
06/wsj_0629:The government has been content with this far-reaching, subtle form of control, exercised on a case-by-case basis with no clear rules or guidelines.
06/wsj_0629:The Securities and Exchange Board of India was set up earlier this year, along the lines of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but New Delhi hasn't pushed the legislation to make it operational.
06/wsj_0629:What about your track record? -- "aren't asked of companies coming to market.
06/wsj_0629:An example is the biggest offering of them all, Larsen & Toubro's $570 million bond issue.
06/wsj_0629:Even stranger is the case of Usha Rectifier, a semiconductor company with 1988 sales of $28 million that's raising $270 million to build an iron plant. 
06/wsj_0629:Mr. Patel agrees: "There is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds.
06/wsj_0629:Because of the large amounts of money being raised, the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used, some analysts fear that there could be a few mega-crashes, which could hurt market confidence far more than the small bankruptcies that followed the boom of 1986.
06/wsj_0629:It says that despite loose regulation of the market itself, its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes. 
06/wsj_0630:Lion Nathan Ltd., a New Zealand brewing and retail concern, said Friday that Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. is "committed" to a transaction whereby Lion Nathan would acquire 50% of Bond's Australian brewing assets. 
06/wsj_0630:SA Brewing, an Australian brewer, last Thursday was given approval to acquire an option for up to 20% of Bell Resources Ltd., a unit of Bond Corp. 
06/wsj_0630:S.A. brewing would make a takeover offer for all of Bell Resources if it exercises the option, according to the commission. 
06/wsj_0630:Bond Corp., a brewing, property, media and resources company, is selling many of its assets to reduce its debts. 
06/wsj_0630:"Lion Nathan has a concluded contract with Bond and Bell Resources," said Douglas Myers, chief executive of Lion Nathan. 
06/wsj_0631:Finnair, Finland's state-owned airline, joined the wave of global airline alliances and signed a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with archrival Scandinavian Airlines System. 
06/wsj_0631:Under the accord, Finnair agreed to coordinate flights, marketing and other functions with SAS, the 50%-state-owned airline of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
06/wsj_0631:Officials hinted, however, that SAS would take a stake of at least 6% in Finnair, valued at about $40 million at current market prices.
06/wsj_0632:General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are now going head to head in the markets for shares of Jaguar PLC, as GM got early clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to boost its stake in the British luxury car maker. 
06/wsj_0632:British government restrictions prevent any single shareholder from going beyond 15% before the end of 1990 without government permission.
06/wsj_0632:Ford, on the other hand, has said it's willing to bid for all of Jaguar, despite the objections of Jaguar chairman Sir John Egan.
06/wsj_0632:Jaguar and GM hope to win Jaguar shareholders approval for the accord partly by structuring it in a way that wouldn't preclude a full Ford bid once the golden share expires. "There's either a minority {stake} package capable of getting Jaguar shareholder approval or there isn't," said one knowledgeable individual. "If there isn't, {the deal} won't be put forward" to shareholders. 
06/wsj_0632:GM's U.K. unit holds crucial talks today with union officials about its consideration of an Ellesmere Port site for its first major engine plant in Britain.
06/wsj_0633:And You Are There, sort of: 
06/wsj_0633:I'm out of bed.
06/wsj_0633:Of course that wasn't the actual conversation the late anti-war activist, protest leader and founder of the Yippies ever had with his brother.
06/wsj_0633:It's a script pieced together from interviews by CBS News for a re-enactment, a dramatic rendering by an actor of Mr. Hoffman's ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression. 
06/wsj_0633:Ms. Chung's program is just one of several network shows (and many more in syndication) that rely on the controversial technique of reconstructing events, using actors who are supposed to resemble real people, living and dead.
06/wsj_0633:He was Mr. Hoffman in a 1979 Los Angeles production of a play called "The Chicago Conspiracy Trial." 
06/wsj_0633:Television news, of course, has always been part show-biz.
06/wsj_0633:Broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role entertainment values play in captivating an audience.
06/wsj_0633:But, as CBS Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer puts it, the network now needs to "broaden the horizons of nonfiction television, and that includes some experimentation." 
06/wsj_0633:It has depicted the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
06/wsj_0633:On Oct. 21, it did a rendition of the kidnapping and imprisonment of Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson, who was abducted in March 1985 and is believed to be held in Lebanon.
06/wsj_0633:ABC News has similarly branched out into entertainment gimmickry. "Prime Time Live," a new show this season featuring Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer, has a studio audience that applauds and that one night (to the embarrassment of the network) waved at the camera like the crowd on "Let's Make a Deal." (ABC stops short of using an "applause" sign and a comic to warm up the audience.
06/wsj_0633:The stars do that themselves.) NBC News has produced three episodes of an occasional series produced by Sid Feders called "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow," starring Maria Shriver, Chuck Scarborough and Mary Alice Williams, that also gives work to actors. 
06/wsj_0633:Or call it the wave of the future. 
06/wsj_0633:The marriage of news and theater, if not exactly inevitable, has been consummated nonetheless.
06/wsj_0633:Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated "tabloid TV" shows as "A Current Affair," which is produced by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
06/wsj_0633:Gerald Stone, the executive producer of "A Current Affair," says, "We have opened eyes to being a little less conservative and more imaginative in how to present the news." 
06/wsj_0633:At 555 W. 57th St. in Manhattan, one floor below the offices of "60 Minutes," the most successful prime-time news program ever, actors wait in the reception area to audition for "Saturday Night With Connie Chung." 
06/wsj_0633:"Saturday Night" has cast actors to appear in future stories ranging from the abortion rights of teen-agers to a Nov. 4 segment on a man named Willie Bosket, who calls himself a "monster" and is reputed to be the toughest prisoner in New York. 
06/wsj_0633:CBS News, which as recently as two years ago fired hundreds of its employees in budget cutbacks, now hires featured actors beginning at $2,700 a week.
06/wsj_0633:That isn't much compared with what Bill Cosby makes, or even Connie Chung for that matter (who is paid $1.6 million a year and who recently did a guest shot of her own on the sitcom "Murphy Brown").
06/wsj_0633:CBS News is also re-enacting the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Middletown, Pa., with something less than a cast of thousands.
06/wsj_0633:It is combing the town of 10,000 for about 200 extras.
06/wsj_0633:On Oct. 20, the town's mayor, Robert Reid, made an announcement on behalf of CBS during half-time at the Middletown High School football game asking for volunteers. 
06/wsj_0633:"There was a roll of laughter through the stands," says Joe Sukle, the editor of the weekly Press and Journal in Middletown. "They're filming right now at the bank down the street, and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards.
06/wsj_0633:Mr. Sukle says he wouldn't dream of participating himself: "No way.
06/wsj_0633:And some people do think that acting out scripts isn't worthy of CBS News, which once lent prestige to the network and set standards for the industry. 
06/wsj_0633:In his review of "Saturday Night With Connie Chung," Tom Shales, the TV critic of the Washington Post and generally an admirer of CBS, wrote that while the show is "impressive, . . . one has to wonder if this is the proper direction for a network news division to take." 
06/wsj_0633:Re-creating events has, in general, upset news traditionalists, including former CBS News President Richard S. Salant and former NBC News President Reuven Frank, former CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and the new dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Joan Konner.
06/wsj_0633:Criticism of the Abbie Hoffman segment is particularly scathing among people who knew and loved the man.
06/wsj_0633:That includes his companion of 15 years, Johanna Lawrenson, as well as his former wife, Anita.
06/wsj_0633:The executive producer of "Saturday Night With Connie Chung," Andrew Lack, declines to discuss re-creactions as a practice or his show, in particular. "I don't talk about my work," he says.
06/wsj_0633:The president of CBS News, David W. Burke, didn't return numerous telephone calls. 
06/wsj_0633:One person close to the process says it would not be in the best interest of CBS News to comment on a "work in progress," such as the Hoffman re-creation, but says CBS News is "aware" of the concerns of Ms. Lawrenson and Mr. Hoffman's former wife.
06/wsj_0633:The producers, he says, did a good job of depicting someone "who had done so much, but who was also a manic-depressive." 
06/wsj_0634:Dentsu Inc., the world's largest advertising agency on the strength of its dominance in the Japanese market, is setting its sights on overseas expansion. 
06/wsj_0634:Last year, Dentsu started HDM, a joint network with U.S. ad agency Young & Rubicam and Eurocom of France.
06/wsj_0634:A few months ago, Dentsu acquired 69% of Australian agency Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd. for 5.9 million Australian dollars (US$4.6 million).
06/wsj_0634:Now, the giant marketing company, which holds 25% of Japan's 4.4 trillion yen ($30.96 billion) advertising industry, is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the U.S. or Europe.
06/wsj_0634:Last year, Dentsu's foreign business accounted for less than 10% of total billings, but the company is aiming at 20% in the near future.
06/wsj_0634:For example, the spokesman says Dentsu has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled British marketing group Saatchi & Saatchi PLC.
06/wsj_0634:It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad. 
06/wsj_0634:Dentsu's billings last year were larger than those of Young & Rubicam, the world's second-largest ad agency, according to a survey by the publication Advertising Age. 
06/wsj_0634:Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry, a practice "that would be unacceptable by traditional Western conflict rules," says Roy Warman, the London chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi's communications division. 
06/wsj_0634:But the different business system would make it hard for Dentsu to provide these Japanese companies the same kind of services they do in Japan. 
06/wsj_0635:Ciba-Geigy AG, the big Swiss chemicals company, said that it agreed in a letter of intent with Corning Inc. to acquire Corning's 50% share of Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corp., based in Medfield, Mass. 
06/wsj_0635:Ciba Corning, which had been a 50-50 venture between Basel-based Ciba-Geigy and Corning, has annual sales of about $300 million, the announcement said.
06/wsj_0635:Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed.
06/wsj_0635:Ciba-Geigy intends to develop the Ciba Corning unit into a "substantial business," making the unit an "integral part" of Ciba-Geigy's "comprehensive disease management concept." 
06/wsj_0636:The NBC network canceled its first new series of the fall TV season, killing Mel Brooks's wacky hotel comedy "The Nutt House." 
06/wsj_0636:The show, one of five new NBC series, is the second casualty of the three networks so far this fall.
06/wsj_0636:Last week CBS Inc. canceled "The People Next Door." NBC's comedy had aired Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. and in five outings had drawn an average of only 13.2% of homes, lagging behind the Jamie Lee Curtis comedy "Anything But Love" on ABC and CBS's one-hour drama "Jake and the Fatman." NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., hasn't decided on a permanent replacement for the canceled series. 
06/wsj_0637:John Labatt Ltd. said it plans a private placement of 150 million Canadian dollars (US$127.5 million) in preferred shares, to be completed around Nov. 1. 
06/wsj_0637:The preferred shares will carry a floating annual dividend equal to 72% of the 30-day bankers' acceptance rate until Dec. 31, 1994.
06/wsj_0637:The shares are redeemable after the end of 1994. 
06/wsj_0637:Mr. Vaux said the share issue is part of a strategy to strengthen Labatt's balance sheet in anticipation of acquisitions to be made during the next 12 to 18 months.
06/wsj_0638:That introduction comes only two weeks after Compaq Computer Corp., believing it had a lead of three to six months on competitors, introduced the first U.S. notebook computer with such features. 
06/wsj_0638:While Compaq sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers, Texas Instruments will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value-added resellers and original-equipment manufacturers. 
06/wsj_0638:Although the Dallas-based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal in 1971 -- a 38-pound monster -- and the world's first microprocessor-based portable in 1976, the only portable machines it has introduced since the first part of the decade have been "dumb" terminals with limited on-board processing ability.
06/wsj_0638:The laptops are not revolutionary and, indeed, are tardy in a market first opened by GRiD Systems Corp., now a unit of Tandy Corp., almost two years ago. 
06/wsj_0638:Its keyboard, according to industry consultants, is better than Compaq's, but its battery life of two to three hours is shorter.
06/wsj_0639:Under current rules, investors in Taiwan can buy overseas stocks only through the purchase of mutual funds issued by local and foreign investment trusts.
06/wsj_0640:Retailers in the West and parts of the South are entering the critical Christmas shopping season with more momentum than those in other regions. 
06/wsj_0640:In a new report, the International Council of Shopping Centers said sales of general merchandise in the West for the first seven months of 1989 rose 6.6% above year-earlier levels. 
06/wsj_0640:But sales in the oil-patch state of Texas surged 12.9% and sales in South Carolina jumped 10.6% in the period, the New York trade group said. 
06/wsj_0640:The numbers show that "we don't have a monolithic economy," said Isaac Lagnado, council research director. "There are a lot of have and have-not markets." 
06/wsj_0640:But Mr. Lagnado predicted the regional trends would continue through Christmas. "The big mo is as much of a factor in retailing as in politics," he said. 
06/wsj_0640:The Christmas quarter is important to retailers because it represents roughly a third of their sales and nearly half of their profits. 
06/wsj_0640:The results reflect a reversal in the fortunes of the regions during the past two years.
06/wsj_0640:Mr. Lagnado said that although retailers probably won't ever recover sales lost because of the California quake and Hurricane Hugo, they could see some benefits later on.
06/wsj_0641:The company said it will move the storage and cross-blending operations to a site 23 miles northeast of Las Vegas to distance the operations from residential areas.
06/wsj_0641:In May 1988, an ammonium perchlorate plant in Henderson owned by an American Pacific Corp. unit was leveled by a series of explosions.
06/wsj_0641:After the explosion, Kerr-McGee temporarily shut down its facility just south of Las Vegas for a safety inspection.
06/wsj_0641:American Pacific and Kerr-McGee are the only two U.S. manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate. 
06/wsj_0642:This maker of electronic devices said it replaced all five incumbent directors at a special meeting called by Milton B. Hollander, whose High Technology Holding Co. of Stamford, Conn. acquired most of its 49.4% stake in Newport in August.
06/wsj_0643:Shiseido Co., Japan's leading cosmetics producer, said it had net income of 5.64 billion yen ($39.7 million) in its first half, which ended Sept. 30. 
06/wsj_0643:Exact comparisons with the previous year were unavailable because of a change in the company's fiscal calendar.
06/wsj_0643:The Tokyo-based company had net of 3.73 billion yen in the previous reporting period, which was the four months ended March 31. 
06/wsj_0644:Bruce W. Wilkinson, president and chief executive officer, was named to the additional post of chairman of this architectural and design services concern.
06/wsj_0644:Mr. Wilkinson, 45 years old, succeeds Thomas A. Bullock, 66, who is retiring as chairman but will continue as a director and chairman of the executive committee. 
06/wsj_0645:A total of 672 transactions were announced during the latest quarter, up 13% from the year-earlier period's 597, Grimm said.
06/wsj_0645:Citing current stock market conditions and the trend away from highly leveraged transactions, Grimm said it wasn't certain that the total value of transactions for the year will exceed the record $247 billion in 1988. 
06/wsj_0646:The franchiser of pharmacies said the added shares will be distributed Dec. 4 to stock of record Nov. 13.
06/wsj_0647:NBI Inc. said that it cannot pay the Oct. 31 dividend on its Series A convertible preferred stock, allowing the stock's holder to convert the shares into as much as 27.7% of NBI's shares outstanding. 
06/wsj_0647:NBI said that it has the funds to pay the dividend, but that it doesn't have the surplus or profit required under Delaware law for payment of the dividend.
06/wsj_0647:Under terms of the stock, the Yukon ESOP can demand that the stock be redeemed for $4,090,000 on Nov. 30, but NBI said it is legally prohibited from making the redemption.
06/wsj_0647:Failure to pay the dividend allows Yukon to convert all or some of its shares into NBI common after Nov. 30, at a conversion price based on NBI's closing stock price. 
06/wsj_0647:NBI, a maker of word-processing systems, said it can't predict if any of the preferred stock will be converted. 
06/wsj_0648:Insurers may see claims resulting from the San Francisco earthquake totaling nearly $1 billion -- far less than the claims they face from Hurricane Hugo -- but the recent spate of catastrophes should jolt property insurance rates in coming months. 
06/wsj_0648:The property claims service division of the American Insurance Services Group estimated insured losses from the earthquake at $960 million.
06/wsj_0648:That's because only about 30% of California homes and businesses had earthquake insurance to cover the losses. 
06/wsj_0648:However, insurance brokers and executives say that the combination of the Bay area earthquake, Hugo and last week's explosion at the Phillips Petroleum Co. 's refinery in Pasadena, Texas, will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump. 
06/wsj_0648:She believes the impact of losses from these catastrophes isn't likely to halt the growth of the industry's surplus capital next year. 
06/wsj_0648:Property reinsurance rates are likely to climb first, analysts and brokers believe. "The reinsurance market has been bloodied by disasters" in the U.S. as well as in Great Britain and Europe, says Thomas Rosencrants, director of research at Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc. in Atlanta. 
06/wsj_0648:Insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses.
06/wsj_0648:Insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm -- a reinsurance company, which, in turn, accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy.
06/wsj_0648:Insurers, such as Cigna Corp., Transamerica Corp, and Aetna Life & Casualty Co., buy reinsurance from other U.S.-based companies and Lloyd's of London for one catastrophe at a time. 
06/wsj_0648:After Hugo hit, many insurers exhausted their reinsurance coverage and had to tap reinsurers to replace that coverage in case there were any other major disasters before the end of the year. 
06/wsj_0648:After the earthquake two weeks ago, brokers say companies scrambled to replace reinsurance coverages again and Lloyd's syndicates turned to the London market excess lines for protection of their own. 
06/wsj_0648:James Snedeker, senior vice president of Gill & Roeser Inc., a New York-based reinsurance broker, says insurers who took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for 1990.
06/wsj_0648:However, companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance are likely to see their rates remain flat, or perhaps even decline slightly.
06/wsj_0648:"It's a seller's market," said Mr. Snedeker of the reinsurance market right now. 
06/wsj_0648:The $472 million of losses State Farm expects from Hugo and an additional $300 million from the earthquake are less than 5% of State Farm's $16.7 billion total net worth. 
06/wsj_0648:Since few insurers have announced what amount of losses they expect to see from the earthquake, it's impossible to get a clear picture of the quake's impact on fourth-quarter earnings, said Herbert Goodfriend at Prudential-Bache Securities Corp. 
06/wsj_0648:Transamerica expects an after-tax charge of less than $3 million against fourth-quarter net; Hartford Insurance Group, a unit of ITT Corp., expects a $15 million or 10 cents after-tax charge; and Fireman's Fund Corp. expects a charge of no more than $50 million before taxes and after using its reinsurance. 
06/wsj_0649:Sales of information-processing products and electric parts increased a strong 22% to 236.23 billion yen from 194.24 billion yen and accounted for 46% of total sales. 
06/wsj_0649:Sales of electric appliances were flat, and sales of electronic equipment declined slightly. 
06/wsj_0650:Sun Microsystems Inc., a computer maker, announced the effectiveness of its registration statement for $125 million of 6 3/8% convertible subordinated debentures due Oct. 15, 1999. 
06/wsj_0650:The company said the debentures are being issued at an issue price of $849 for each $1,000 principal amount and are convertible at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of $25 a share. 
06/wsj_0651:Nelson Holdings International Ltd. shareholders approved a 1-for-10 consolidation of the company's common stock at a special meeting. 
06/wsj_0651:At the same time, shareholders approved the adoption of a rights plan and a super-majority voting approval requirement.
06/wsj_0651:They also approved the relocation of the company's registered office to Toronto from Vancouver and a name change to NHI Nelson Holdings International Ltd. 
06/wsj_0651:The number of authorized common shares will remain at 100 million.
06/wsj_0651:Under the rights plan, holders will have one right for each common share held, with each right entitling the purchase of one common share for 100 Canadian dollars.
06/wsj_0651:The rights plan would be triggered if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the common shares outstanding without making an offer to all shareholders. 
06/wsj_0651:Under the super-majority amendment, certain mergers and other transactions would require approval of holders of 80% of the company's common shares outstanding. 
06/wsj_0652:Wilfred American Educational Corp. said a federal grand jury in Boston indicted the operator of cosmetology and business schools for mail fraud. 
06/wsj_0652:The charges in the 12-count indictment, which stem from events that allegedly occurred in late 1984 and early 1985, involve enrollment procedures of six students and the preparation of certain reports, Wilfred said.
06/wsj_0652:Eight admissions representatives at two of Wilfred's former Massachusetts schools previously pleaded guilty to charges of aiding, abetting and counseling students to submit false financial-aid applications.
06/wsj_0653:Rally's, a Louisville, Ky., fast-food chain, alleges that the three investors, who are directors of the company, broke securities laws because they didn't disclose their intentions to acquire a big Rally's stake. 
06/wsj_0653:The group, led by Giant Group Ltd. and its chairman, Mr. Sugarman, owns about 45.2% of Rally's.
06/wsj_0653:In the Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the group has said it may seek control of Rally's. 
06/wsj_0653:Mr. Sugarman called the lawsuit "not nice" and said his group will continue to push for control of the company and the removal of certain directors. 
06/wsj_0653:The Patterson group, which controls about 42% of Rally's shares, also may seek control. 
06/wsj_0653:Rally's also said it formed a committee of three directors, who aren't associated with either the Patterson or Sugarman groups, to analyze the situation. 
06/wsj_0654:Leaseway Transportation Corp. said it will restructure $192.5 million of certain subordinated debentures to reduce its debt obligations and interest expense. 
06/wsj_0654:The 13.25% subordinated debentures due 2002 were issued in August 1987 as part of the $690 million financing for a leveraged buy-out of the company.
06/wsj_0654:But the proposed transaction calls for an exchange of the debt for new debentures of lower face value and reduced cash interest.
06/wsj_0654:Company officials said Leaseway fulfilled payment requirements of its debt obligations since the leveraged buy-out, but "our performance since the {buy-out} makes it imperative to implement actions that will further improve our cash flow." 
06/wsj_0655:Lawmakers haven't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the Contras, and President Bush parried the question at a news conference here Saturday, saying only that "if there's an all-out military offensive, that's going to change the equation 180 degrees." 
06/wsj_0655:But Mr. Ortega's threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him, effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters. 
06/wsj_0655:Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said yesterday on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" that Mr. Ortega's threat was "a very unwise move, particularly the timing of it." 
06/wsj_0655:Not only did Mr. Ortega's comments come in the midst of what was intended as a showcase for the region, it came as Nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections.
06/wsj_0655:Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates.
06/wsj_0655:And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the Contras are to receive the rest of the $49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the Bush administration in March. 
06/wsj_0655:While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question, rejected by Congress and de-emphasized by the Bush administration, Mr. Ortega's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue. 
06/wsj_0655:"The administration should now state that if the {February} election is voided by the Sandinistas . . . they should call for military aid," said former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams. "In these circumstances, I think they'd win." 
06/wsj_0655:Secretary of State James Baker, who accompanied President Bush to Costa Rica, told reporters Friday: "I have no reason to deny reports that some Contras ambushed some Sandinista soldiers." 
06/wsj_0655:In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid, Mr. Ortega's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections. 
06/wsj_0655:"My sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for clamping down on campaigning" by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency, he said. 
06/wsj_0656:Milton Petrie, chairman of Petrie Stores Corp., said he has agreed to sell his 15.2% stake in Deb Shops Corp. to Petrie Stores. 
06/wsj_0656:The filing said Petrie Stores of Secaucus, N.J., is purchasing Mr. Petrie's Deb Shops stake as an investment.
06/wsj_0656:Although Petrie Stores has considered seeking to acquire the remaining equity of Deb Stores, it has no current intention to pursue such a possibility, the filing said. 
06/wsj_0657:Nikon said sales rose despite the adverse effect of Japan's unpopular consumption tax, introduced in April.
06/wsj_0657:Exports made up 46.2% of the latest year's total, up from 39.8% a year ago. 
06/wsj_0658:Presidio, a Denver oil and gas concern, said it will acquire the properties and operations of Home Petroleum Corp., which includes two regional gas-gathering systems and proved reserves of about nine million barrels of oil and 72 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 
06/wsj_0658:Gulf Canada, Calgary, said the transaction is part of its plan to sell non-strategic assets and focus operations on Canada, Indonesia and other international areas. 
06/wsj_0658:A spokesman for Gulf Canada, which is controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family, said the properties account for about 6% of the company's assets and produce about 5,000 barrels of oil and 35 million cubic feet of gas a day.
06/wsj_0659:Sales of electrical devices rose 13% to 283.8 billion yen from 251.8 billion yen.
06/wsj_0659:It said sales of home electronic products advanced 3.7% to 44.92 billion yen from 43.34 billion yen. 
06/wsj_0659:In the period just ended, computers accounted for 44% of total sales, NEC said, and electrical devices made up 23%. 
06/wsj_0659:NEC forecast sales for the year ending next March 31 of 2.74 trillion yen, an increase of 27% from the previous fiscal year.
06/wsj_0660:A. definitively agreed to buy all of the publicly held shares of Erbamont N.V. for $37 each. 
06/wsj_0660:Montedison now owns about 72% of Erbamont's shares outstanding. 
06/wsj_0660:The companies said the accord was unanimously approved by a special committee of Erbamont directors unaffiliated with Montedison. 
06/wsj_0660:The tender offer will be followed by the sale of all of Erbamont's assets, subject to all of its liabilities, to Montedison.
06/wsj_0660:Erbamont will then be liquidated, with any remaining Erbamont holders receiving a distribution of $37 a share. 
06/wsj_0660:The companies said the transaction is being structured this way because the laws of the Netherlands Antilles, under which Erbamont is organized, don't provide for merger transactions. 
06/wsj_0661:A unit of DPC Acquisition Partners launched a $10-a-share tender offer for the shares outstanding of Dataproducts Corp., and said it would seek to liquidate the computer-printer maker "as soon as possible," even if a merger isn't consummated. 
06/wsj_0661:DPC Acquisition said it had received the reasonable assurance of Chase Manhattan Bank N.A. that the financing can be obtained. 
06/wsj_0661:DPC Acquisition added that it has not begun discussions with financing sources, and said it expected to repay the amounts borrowed through proceeds of the liquidation. 
06/wsj_0662:Jayark Corp. agreed to pay $4 million in cash, $2 million of 12% convertible debentures, and 1.6 million common shares to acquire closely held Kofcoh Imports Inc. 
06/wsj_0662:At the market price, the transaction has a total indicated value of $7.4 million. 
06/wsj_0662:David L. Koffman, president and chief executive officer of Jayark, holds about 40% of Kofcoh, Jayark said. 
06/wsj_0662:In the quarter ended July 31, Jayark had an average of 5.6 million shares outstanding. 
06/wsj_0662:The transaction is subject to approval by a panel of disinterested directors, the company said, adding that shareholder approval isn't needed. 
06/wsj_0663:Sales were higher in all of the company's business categories, with the biggest growth coming in sales of foodstuffs such as margarine, coffee and frozen food, which rose 6.3%. 
06/wsj_0663:Ajinomoto predicted sales in the current fiscal year ending next March 31 of 480 billion yen, compared with 460.05 billion yen in fiscal 1989.
06/wsj_0663:It said it expects full-year net of 16 billion yen, compared with 15 billion yen in the latest year. 
06/wsj_0664:Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules.
06/wsj_0664:Only three weeks earlier, the Merc had turned to one of its own executives, 40-year-old R. Patrick Thompson, to replace Rosemary T. McFadden as president.
06/wsj_0664:Mr. Thompson is believed to have a mandate from the board of directors to help improve the Merc's tarnished reputation as an exchange whose floor traders don't follow the rules very well. 
06/wsj_0664:Mr. Guttman told one person familiar with the New York exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who would be "responsive to the needs of the membership and the board." 
06/wsj_0664:He previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel. 
06/wsj_0664:Mr. Staloff, 44, was a senior officer of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and is considered a specialist in new financial products. 
06/wsj_0664:Mr. Thompson isn't bereft of experience with new products, however.
06/wsj_0664:The educational effort of teaching companies in the natural gas industry how to use the futures to hedge would have to continue for another a year or two, he added.
06/wsj_0664:The Merc's extremely successful contracts in crude oil, gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in New York, and third behind the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
06/wsj_0664:In a recent interview, Mr. Thompson said the biggest problem facing all commodity exchanges was one of image.
06/wsj_0664:So far they have issued scores of subpoenas, some of which went to members of the New York Merc.
06/wsj_0664:Mr. Thompson will have to face some of the consequences of those subpoenas. 
06/wsj_0664:It levied the smallest number of suspensions of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years.
06/wsj_0664:The Merc received considerable criticism in 1987 when it was discovered that its compliance director, Kevin P. Conway, who then was responsible for policing the exchange's busy oil and metal pits, "was engaged in other personal business activities on Exchange time," including out-of-state trips, according to a New York Merc report prepared last year.
06/wsj_0664:"We had a management breakdown in 1987 in terms of compliance," Mr. Thompson says. "We recognized the problem and took care of it." He says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly, the 1990 business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed. 
06/wsj_0664:For years the five New York exchanges have been talking about cooperating in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations.
06/wsj_0664:Periodically, there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges.
06/wsj_0664:Mr. Thompson believes the case for working together is stronger now than ever. "The cost of competition has become extremely high," he says. "We must find ways to save money for the futures commission merchants who do business on our exchanges." He thinks that progress in cooperation can be made in areas where no vested interests have built up.
06/wsj_0664:One of those areas is the development of a hand-held electronic device that would permit floor traders to enter trades as they make them.
06/wsj_0664:The GAO has recommended the creation of a system to record trade data so that an independent, verifiable audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud.
06/wsj_0664:Another major electronics problem faces Mr. Thompson -- the creation of a 24-hour trading system that can be used outside normal trading hours.
06/wsj_0664:In January, the New York Merc signed a letter of intent with the Chicago Merc as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system called Globex.
06/wsj_0664:But in May, the Chicago Merc said it was looking into creating a common system with the Chicago Board of Trade, and it suspended negotiations with the New York Merc. 
06/wsj_0664:Mr. Thompson says his exchange isn't waiting for the results of the Chicago exchanges' cooperation.
06/wsj_0664:He added that talk of strike settlements at producing mines has been fully discounted.
06/wsj_0664:William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said the price action for all of last week is the best he has seen on a weekly basis in more than a year.
06/wsj_0664:Prices this week will likely be dominated by reports on the progress of the corn and soybean harvest as well as by speculation about more purchases of U.S. crops by the Soviet Union. 
06/wsj_0664:If the weather allowed farmers to work in their fields over the weekend, many Midwest grain elevators will probably sell futures contracts today at the Chicago Board of Trade in order to hedge their weekend purchases from farmers.
06/wsj_0664:That selling of futures contracts by elevators is what helps keep downward pressure on crop prices during the harvest. 
06/wsj_0664:Traders will also watch for whether the Soviet Union continues its traditional fall buying of U.S. grain.
06/wsj_0664:So far this month, the Soviets have bought about 7.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn. 
06/wsj_0664:There may be some activity in soybean prices this week as investors try to get rid of the contract for November delivery.
06/wsj_0664:Investors usually don't want to take physical delivery of a contract, preferring instead to profit from its price swings and then end any obligation to take delivery or make delivery as it nears expiration. 
06/wsj_0665:Employees of the Globe and Mail, a Thomson Corp. newspaper in Toronto, voted to accept a tentative contract agreement Saturday, averting a strike at Canada's leading daily. 
06/wsj_0665:Under the terms of the three-year contract, similar to one reached at Torstar Corp. 's Toronto Star newspaper earlier this month, the 500 Globe and Mail workers will see a raise of 8% in the contract's first year and 7% in each of the following two years. 
06/wsj_0665:Lorne Slotnick, vice chairman of the Southern Ontario Newspaper Guild, the union representing the workers, said Thomson made significant concessions in the final round of talks.
06/wsj_0665:He said more than 70% of the bargaining unit voted in favor of the agreement. 
06/wsj_0666:For three years, a healthy economy and the export-boosting effects of a weak dollar propelled sales and earnings of the big paper companies to record levels.
06/wsj_0666:As the good times rolled they more than doubled their prices for pulp, a raw material used in all sorts of paper, to $830 a metric ton this past spring from $380 a ton at the start of 1986. 
06/wsj_0666:"Put your money in a good utility or bank stock, not a paper company," advises George Adler of Smith Barney. 
06/wsj_0666:Gary Palmero of Oppenheimer & Co. expects a 30% decline in earnings between now and 1991 for "commodity-oriented" paper companies, which account for the majority of the industry.
06/wsj_0666:Robert Schneider of Duff & Phelps sees paper-company stock prices falling 10% to 15% in 1990, perhaps 25% if there's a recession. 
06/wsj_0666:But they attribute much of the weakness to customer inventory reductions.
06/wsj_0666:Generally they maintain that, barring a recession and a further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies, the industry isn't headed for a prolonged slump. "It won't be an earthshaking drop," a Weyerhaeuser spokesman says. 
06/wsj_0666:Oppenheimer's Mr. Palmero, meanwhile, is steering clear of Gaylord Container, Stone Container and Federal Paper Board.
06/wsj_0666:Lawrence Ross of PaineWebber would avoid Union Camp. 
06/wsj_0666:Great Northern Nekoosa said, "The odds of the dire predictions about us being right are small." International Paper emphasizes that it is better positioned than most companies for the coming overcapacity because its individual mills can make more than one grade of paper. 
06/wsj_0666:A Boise-Cascade spokesman referred to a speech by Chairman John Fery, in which he said that markets generally are stable, although some risk of further price deterioration exists. 
06/wsj_0666:Gaylord Container said analysts are skeptical of it because it's carrying a lot of debt.
06/wsj_0666:Louisiana Pacific and Georgia Pacific said a number of other analysts are recommending them because of their strong wood-products business. 
06/wsj_0666:Federal Paper Board said, "We're not as exposed as the popular perception of us." The company explained that its main product, bleached paperboard, which goes into some advertising materials and white boxes, historically doesn't have sharp price swings. 
06/wsj_0666:Because the stock prices of some paper companies already reflect an expected profit slump, PaineWebber's Mr. Ross says he thinks that next year the share prices of some companies may fall at most only 5% to 10%.
06/wsj_0666:Some take a warm view of consumer-oriented paper companies, which buy pulp from the commodity producers and should benefit from the expected declines in pulp prices.
06/wsj_0666:A spokesman for Scott says that assuming the price of pulp continues to soften, "We should do well." 
06/wsj_0667:Shoney's Inc. said it will report a write-off of $2.5 million, or seven cents a share, for its fourth quarter ended yesterday.
06/wsj_0667:The restaurant operator cited transaction costs from its 1988 recapitalization as a result of a $160 million restructuring of its bank debt. 
06/wsj_0667:In addition, the effective interest rate on the $410 million of total remaining bank debt after the restructuring is 10.66%.
06/wsj_0667:The combined effect of these changes is expected to save the company about $4 million in interest expenses next year, or six cents a share. 
06/wsj_0667:Shoney's said the latest restructuring affected bank indebtedness that was incurred to finance $585 million of the company's $728 million recapitalization that took place in 
06/wsj_0667:The company has made payments of $175 million against the original $585 million of bank debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization.
06/wsj_0667:These payments consisted of $54 million in scheduled payments and $121 million in prepayments, funded by $82.8 million from operating cash flow, zero-coupon subordinated debt and assets sales. 
06/wsj_0668:ABB said the contract, signed with the Dutch utility N.V. Energieproduktiebedrijf UNA, is valued in excess of $200 million.
06/wsj_0668:ABB Asea Brown Boveri is the Dutch unit of the Swedish-Swiss electrical engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG. 
06/wsj_0668:ABB said a significant portion of the order will be placed with Dutch subcontractors, adding that a group has been set up for this purpose. 
06/wsj_0669:The executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because Nissan is spending heavily to bolster its dealership network in Japan and because of currency-exchange fluctuations. 
06/wsj_0669:During the next decade, Mr. Kume said, Nissan plans to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently to account for a majority of sales outside Japan.
06/wsj_0669:"By the end of the 1990s," he said, "we want to be producing roughly two vehicles overseas for every vehicle that we export from Japan." That will involve a substantial increase in overseas manufacturing capacity, he acknowledged, but didn't provide specific details. 
06/wsj_0670:National Intergroup Inc. said it expects to report a charge of $5.3 million related to the sale of its aluminum unit's extrusion division for the third quarter. 
06/wsj_0670:The charge is offset by an after-tax gain of about $30 million in the quarter from the previously announced pact to sell National Aluminum's rolling division. 
06/wsj_0670:National Intergroup in the year-ago third quarter earned $22.5 million, or 97 cents a share, including a gain of $18 million from the sale of a steel tube company.
06/wsj_0670:The company also said it continues to explore all options concerning the possible sale of National Aluminum's 54.5% stake in an aluminum smelter in Hawesville, Ky. 
06/wsj_0670:The sale of the extrusion division is subject to audit adjustments for working capital changes through the closing. 
06/wsj_0670:The agreement also provides for potential payments of additional proceeds to National Aluminum over the next two years, depending on the plant's shipping levels. 
06/wsj_0670:In fiscal 1989, it had sales of about $40 million and an operating loss of $1.5 million. 
06/wsj_0671:The municipal bond market is bracing for tough times through the end of the year as it struggles to absorb an oversupply of bonds and two of its best customers turn into sellers. 
06/wsj_0671:Commercial banks and property/casualty insurers, which together own about 36% of all municipal bonds, have been dumping their securities for weeks.
06/wsj_0671:As a result, yields on long-term muni bonds now stand at about 95% of long-term Treasury yields, the highest such level in more than two years. 
06/wsj_0671:"There is incredible negative psychology building in the market," said Donna Avedisian, a vice president at Merrill Lynch & Co. "People are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers." The yield on a group of 25 revenue bonds compiled by the Bond Buyer, a trade publication, now exceeds 7.50%. 
06/wsj_0671:Individuals eager for tax-free income drove up bond prices, making state and local government debt one of the best-performing types of fixed-income investments during the period. 
06/wsj_0671:Big banks such as Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan, which have been taking heavy charges to expand their Third World loan-loss reserves, aren't looking for tax-exempt income. "We don't need the shelter of tax-free bonds," said a spokeswoman at Chemical. 
06/wsj_0671:In recent weeks, traders said, Chemical has sold more than $1 billion of tax-free bonds.
06/wsj_0671:Insurance companies are rushing to sell before the end of the year, when some of their tax benefits associated with municipal bonds will be phased out.
06/wsj_0671:Muni bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue, at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs.
06/wsj_0671:The recent natural disasters, and the need of many other cities to rebuild crumbling infrastructure, suggests that supply of new issues will continue to rise sharply -- even as demand tapers off. 
06/wsj_0671:"There is just so much going on that it's difficult to pick just one factor that's driving the market," said Ronald Ian Heller, vice president at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc., a subsidiary of First Chicago Corp. 
06/wsj_0671:Some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign.
06/wsj_0671:The offering will include $729 million of 20-year tax-exempt bonds and $57.8 million of taxable bonds.
06/wsj_0671:A few weeks ago, New York sold $750 million of tax-exempts. 
06/wsj_0671:The sell-off in New York City bonds was triggered by concerns about the city's financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election.
06/wsj_0671:Treasury bonds fell sharply on confusion about this week's Treasury debt auction and rumors that a major Japanese investor was unloading large amounts of long-term bonds. 
06/wsj_0671:The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 2/32, down nearly 5/8 point from Thursday, or about $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount.
06/wsj_0671:Credit market analysts expected the Treasury to cancel today's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $17 billion of cash management bills. 
06/wsj_0671:Instead, the Treasury announced it would sell $2 billion of 51-day cash management bills today and said that the weekly sale of $15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills will take place today, as usual, but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of Thursday. 
06/wsj_0671:The market also was hurt by rumors that Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru, a Japanese brokerage firm, was unloading some of the 30-year bonds it recently purchased.
06/wsj_0671:One dealer said the talk was that the firm sold about $500 million of bellwether 30-year bonds. 
06/wsj_0671:The firm is thought to have purchased up to $3 billion of 30-year bonds in a buying spree on Wednesday and the previous Thursday. 
06/wsj_0671:Dealers say the firm apparently has wanted to publicize its recent buying and subsequent selling of 30-year bonds by using Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Corp. as a broker.
06/wsj_0671:Nippon Kangyo's moves puzzled traders and created confusion among potential investors, many of whom decided to stay out of the market.
06/wsj_0671:As a result of its large-scale buying, some analysts now say that liquidity, or the ability to easily buy and sell, has been constrained in the benchmark Treasury bond issue. 
06/wsj_0671:-- The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. rallied Friday on news that the company is selling its candy bar brands to Nestle Foods Corp. for $370 million. 
06/wsj_0671:"It shows that there are buyers of high-quality assets at high prices in today's market," said Robert Long, managing director and head of the high-yield research department at First Boston Corp. 
06/wsj_0671:Many of the RJR securities, which had been trading near their 52-week lows earlier in the session, bounced back after the company's announcement that it agreed to sell its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle Foods, a unit of the Swiss-based food concern.
06/wsj_0671:The sale, expected to close before the end of the year, also includes a manufacturing plant in Franklin Park, Ill. 
06/wsj_0671:RJR's subordinated discount debentures of 2001, which traded as low as 45 Friday, finished the day at 46 7/8.
06/wsj_0671:Most other junk bond issues finished a quarter-point lower on rumors that Campeau Corp. was filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
06/wsj_0671:Dealers said some defensive investors were buyers of mortgages, as were dealers seeking collateral for REMICs priced earlier last week.
06/wsj_0671:Among major issues, Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for November delivery ended at 98 12/32, down 8/32 point for a yield of about 9.35% to a 12-year average life assumption. 
06/wsj_0672:The premium the elderly pay for coverage of doctor's bills under Part B of the Medicare health insurance plan will rise to $29 a month in 1990 from $27.90, the Department of Health and Human Services said. 
06/wsj_0672:In addition, a second Part B premium to cover the cost of the new program of insurance against catastrophic illness will rise to $4.90 a month from $4, if Congress doesn't change the program. 
06/wsj_0672:The House has voted to repeal most of the Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, however, which would end the monthly catastrophic-care premium, as well as an unpopular income surtax paid by about 40% of the wealthier Medicare beneficiaries. 
06/wsj_0672:Medicare Part B pays 80% of a beneficiary's allowable doctor's bills after an annual deductible of $75.
06/wsj_0672:Both the House and Senate bills to reduce the cost and coverage of the catastrophic-care plan would eliminate the cap on doctor's bills. 
06/wsj_0672:If the Senate plan prevails, the premium will be $33.90, with the additional $4.90 going to pay for expanded hospital coverage under Part A of Medicare.
06/wsj_0672:Most of Part A's costs are paid by a payroll tax on workers and employers. 
06/wsj_0673:The Lockheed unit has 24,000 workers; it expects to make the cuts through a combination of furloughs, attrition and retirements.
06/wsj_0673:The reductions should be complete by the end of the year, a spokesman said, adding that the exact number to be cut hasn't been determined. 
06/wsj_0673:Lockheed reported a $32 million third-quarter net loss, largely because of cost overruns on fixed-price military contracts. 
06/wsj_0673:Noting that other defense contractors are complaining of losses on such contracts, analysts say taxpayers have been getting illusionary bargains on weapons systems in recent years. 
06/wsj_0674:Jim Pattison Industries Ltd., one of a group of closely held companies owned by entrepreneur James Pattison, said it "intends to seek control" of 30%-owned Innopac Inc., a Toronto packaging concern. 
06/wsj_0674:Jim Pattison Industries, a holding company with annual sales of about C$1.9 billion, largely from car dealerships and grocery stores, didn't elaborate on the statement, and a company official declined further comment. 
06/wsj_0674:The company said it currently holds about 4.2 million of Innopac's 13.8 million common shares outstanding, which have an aggregate market value of about 137.8 million Canadian dollars (US$117.3 million). 
06/wsj_0674:Separately, Innopac reported a fourth-quarter loss of about C$2.6 million, or 18 Canadian cents a share, reflecting inventory write-downs.
06/wsj_0674:A joint venture involving units of Innopac and Mobil Corp. earlier this year opened the first U.S. polystyrene recycling plant, in Leominster, Mass. 
06/wsj_0675:The slowdown raises questions about the economy's strength because spending fueled much of the third-quarter GNP growth.
06/wsj_0675:The tentative pact would resolve part of a broad investigation of the Atlanta-based company in the past year. 
06/wsj_0675:The accord helps RJR pay off debt and boosts Nestle's 7% share of the U.S. candy market to 12%. 
06/wsj_0675:Sansui Electric agreed to sell a 51% stake to Polly Peck of Britain for $110 million.
06/wsj_0675:Nashua strengthened its poison-pill plan after announcing a Dutch firm is seeking to buy up to 25% of the New Hampshire copier company. 
06/wsj_0675:Mobil is cutting back its U.S. oil and gas exploration and production group by up to 15% as part of a restructuring of the business. 
06/wsj_0676:(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 
06/wsj_0676:Thomas Jefferson sold Congress on the idea of the decimal system for currency, thus saving Americans the headaches of pounds, shillings and pence.
06/wsj_0676:But he struck out with the decimal system of metric weights and measures the French had invented.
06/wsj_0676:In 1807, the Swiss mathematician who headed the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey made an "iron meter" that he had brought from Europe the standard of measure.
06/wsj_0676:By the end of the century scientists had embraced the system. 
06/wsj_0676:Today, though the public is barely aware, much of U.S. industry, particularly companies manufacturing or selling overseas, have made metrics routine.
06/wsj_0677:Whittle said its field staff signed up the 500 schools in 238 school districts after only eight weeks and company executives now expect to reach their start-up goal of 1,000 schools before the end of this year. 
06/wsj_0677:Christopher Whittle, chairman of the Knoxville, Tenn., media company that is 50% owned by Time Warner Inc., said that by December 1990 he expects to have Channel One installed in about 8,000 schools with a potential audience of six million.
06/wsj_0677:Installation of the TV system, which includes providing free 19-inch TV sets in classrooms, begins in January. 
06/wsj_0677:He said his sales force is signing up schools at the rate of 25 a day. 
06/wsj_0677:About 10% of the school districts approached have rejected the network. 
06/wsj_0677:Mr. Whittle said that so far, three of the six schools that carried the program in a five-week test last spring have subscribed to the program.
06/wsj_0677:One of the test schools, Withrow High School in Cincinnati, rejected the project. 
06/wsj_0677:John Bruner, associate director of communications for Cincinnati Public Schools, said Channel One was rejected because students watching the program didn't fare particularly better on a 28-question current events quiz than a control school without the program and school absences were almost unchanged during the period when the program was being aired. 
06/wsj_0677:"The number of correct responses was 45% on the test and school absences didn't change much," said Mr. Bruner. "The pilot program was received well (by teachers and students), but there wasn't reason enough to sign up.
06/wsj_0677:Installation of satellite dishes, TVs and videocassette equipment will cost the company about $20,000 per school, Mr. Whittle said.

06/wsj_0681:Wham! Bam! Twice in two weeks the unraveling of the on-again, off-again UAL buy-out slammed the stock market. 
06/wsj_0681:The number of issues falling on the New York Stock Exchange each day is eclipsing the number of gainers.
06/wsj_0681:And the number of stocks hitting new lows far outstrips the number setting new highs. 
06/wsj_0681:But why should an iffy $6.79 billion leveraged buy-out deal shake the foundations of the entire stock market? 
06/wsj_0681:There are, of course, analysts who view the near-panic that briefly swept through investors on Oct. 13 and again on Oct. 24 as momentary lapses of good judgment that have only temporarily undermined a healthy stock market.
06/wsj_0681:"There will still be deals," argues Mr. Connolly. "There may not be as many and the buyers may not get away with some of the things they've done in the past, but deals won't disappear." He forecasts that the emphasis in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he calls "strategic deals, in which somebody is taking over a company not to milk the cash flow, but because it's a good fit." 
06/wsj_0681:For the long-term investor who picks stocks carefully, the price volatility can provide welcome buying opportunities as short-term players scramble frantically to sell stocks in a matter of minutes. "Who can make the better decision, the guy who has 10 seconds to decide what to do or the guy with all the time in the world?" he says. "What on earth does the UAL deal have to do with the price of Walmart, which I was able to buy on Oct. 16 at a very attractive price?" 
06/wsj_0681:Kidder Peabody's Mr. Jarrett also sees some benefits to the stock market's recent drop. "We've run into a market that was beginning to run out of steam and get frothy," he says. "The balloon had been blown up so big that when somebody came along with a pin -- in this case the UAL deal -- we got a little pop." 
06/wsj_0681:But he figures that at current levels the stock market is comfortably valued, even with the economy obviously slowing. "Just because we've got some realism back in the market doesn't mean it's going lower from here," he says. "The bottom line is that it's healthy to have this kind of sideways activity, especially after a 30% gain in stock values over the past 12 months." He's now estimating that after a period of consolidation, the Dow Jones Industrial Average will once again forge new highs. 
06/wsj_0681:Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, isn't nearly so sanguine about the market's chances of surging to new highs anytime soon.
06/wsj_0681:At current levels of economic activity and earnings, stocks are fairly valued, she says.
06/wsj_0681:But any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation that accompanies a vigorous merger and buy-out business, and UAL has obviously put a damper on that. "Stocks aren't cheap anymore, there have been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the arithmetic of deals," she says. "I'm not saying they've stopped altogether, but future deals are going to be structured differently and bids probably won't be as high." 
06/wsj_0681:Third-quarter earnings have been generally disappointing and with economic data showing a clear slowing, the outlook for earnings in the fourth quarter and all of 1990 is getting worse. 
06/wsj_0681:"There are a lot more downward than upward revisions and it looks like people are questioning corporate profits as a means of support for stock prices," she says. 
06/wsj_0681:Declining issues on the Big Board were far ahead of gainers, 1,108 to 416.
06/wsj_0681:Oil stocks escaped the brunt of Friday's selling and several were able to post gains, including Chevron, which rose 5/8 to 66 3/8 in Big Board composite trading of 2.4 million shares.
06/wsj_0681:Both companies declined to comment on the rumors, but several industry analysts told the Professional Investor Report they believed it was plausible that Pennzoil may be buying Chevron shares as a prelude to pushing for a restructuring of the company. 
06/wsj_0681:Unisys dropped 3/4 to 16 1/4 after posting a third-quarter loss of $4.25 a share, including restructuring charges, but other important technology issues were mixed. 
06/wsj_0681:Montedison, which owns about 72% of the company's common stock, agreed to buy the rest for $37 a share.
06/wsj_0681:Himont, another majority-owned unit of Montedison, added 1 1/4 to 47 1/8. 
06/wsj_0682:Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July's crash of a United Airlines flight in Iowa: a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk. 
06/wsj_0682:The explosion sent shards of metal flying, severing the DC-10's hydraulic or control systems, and led to the crash that killed 112 people. 
06/wsj_0682:But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232's tail engine from a cornfield near the Sioux City Airport in Iowa.
06/wsj_0682:The safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in Sioux City.
06/wsj_0682:Among the issues the board will examine is whether United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks.
06/wsj_0682:Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw -- known as "hard alpha" -- occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago.
06/wsj_0683:Researchers at Ohio State University and Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology in China have analyzed samples of glacial ice in Tibet and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past half-century than in any similar period in the past 10,000 years. 
06/wsj_0683:The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times, largely because of pollutants in the air, and will warm far more in the century ahead.
06/wsj_0683:A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth's polar ice caps, raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas. 
06/wsj_0683:To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years, researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen.
06/wsj_0683:These measurements can indicate temperature changes, researchers said, because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change. 
06/wsj_0683:Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap, a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level, show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age, Mr. Thompson said.
06/wsj_0683:Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans, which moderate temperature changes. 
06/wsj_0683:According to greenhouse theories, increased carbon dioxide emissions, largely caused by burning of fossil fuels, will cause the Earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space. 
06/wsj_0683:But he said ice samples from Peru, Greenland and Antarctica all show substantial signs of warming. 
06/wsj_0684:The maker of hand-held computers and computer systems said the personnel changes were needed to improve the efficiency of its manufacturing operation. 
06/wsj_0685:CNW Corp. said the final step in the acquisition of the company has been completed with the merger of CNW with a subsidiary of Chicago & North Western Holdings Corp. 
06/wsj_0685:As reported, CNW agreed to be acquired by a group of investors led by Blackstone Capital Partners Limited Partnership for $50 a share, or about $950 million. 
06/wsj_0686:The fiscal 1990 measure builds on a pattern set earlier this year by House and Senate defense authorizing committees, and -- at a time of retrenchment for the military and concern about the U.S.'s standing in the world economy -- overseas spending is most vulnerable.
06/wsj_0686:The result is that instead of the Pentagon's proposed split of 60-40 between domestic and foreign bases, the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately 70-30.
06/wsj_0686:The extra margin for bases in the U.S. enhances the power of the appropriations committees; meanwhile, lawmakers used their positions to garner as much as six times what the Pentagon had requested for their individual states. 
06/wsj_0686:West Virginia, home of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, would receive $21.5 million -- four times the military's request.
06/wsj_0686:Tennessee and North Carolina, home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees, receive $243.2 million, or 25% above the Pentagon's request.
06/wsj_0686:Though spending for Iowa and Oregon was far less, their increases above Pentagon requests -- 640% and 430%, respectively -- were much greater because of the influence of Republicans at critical junctures. 
06/wsj_0686:The swift passage of the bill, which cleared the Senate and House on simple voice votes last week, contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome $66.8 billion measure funding housing, environmental, space and veterans programs.
06/wsj_0686:By an 84-6 margin, the Senate approved the bulk of the spending Friday, but the bill was then sent back to the House to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the Federal Housing Administration. 
06/wsj_0686:Appropriations committees have used an assortment of devices to disguise as much as $1 billion in spending, and as critics have awakened to these devices, the bill can seem like a wounded caribou trying to make it past ice and wolves to reach safer winter grazing. 
06/wsj_0686:Much of the excess spending will be pushed into fiscal 1991, and in some cases is temporarily parked in slow-spending accounts in anticipation of being transferred to faster-spending areas after the budget scorekeeping is completed. 
06/wsj_0686:For example, a House-Senate conference ostensibly increased the National Aeronautics and Space Administration budget for construction of facilities to nearly $592 million, or more than $200 million above what either chamber had previously approved.
06/wsj_0686:Part of the increase would provide $90 million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid rocket-motor facility in Mr. Whitten's Mississippi.
06/wsj_0686:But as much as $177 million, or nearly 30% of the account, is marked for potential transfers to research, management and flight accounts that are spent out at a faster clip. 
06/wsj_0686:The bill's managers face criticism, too, for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent.
06/wsj_0686:Conservatives, embarrassed by Republican influence-peddling scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a Democratic-controlled Congress.
06/wsj_0686:Within discretionary funds for community development grants, more than $3.7 million is allocated to six projects in Michigan, home state of a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Bob Traxler.
06/wsj_0687:Dennis Farney's Oct. 13 page-one article "River of Despair," about the poverty along the Mississippi, fanned childhood memories of when my parents were sharecroppers in southeastern Arkansas, only a few miles from the river.
06/wsj_0687:Fortunately, an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm and moved us 50 miles north to good schools and an environment that opened the world of opportunity for me as an eight-year-old. 
06/wsj_0687:Though I've been blessed with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world, I've never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of the 1930s. 
06/wsj_0687:Most of the land in that and other parts of the Delta are now owned by second, third or fourth generations of the same families.
06/wsj_0687:Following World War II, when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops formerly requiring 20 families, the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no Social Security, no skills in the workplace, no hope for their future except welfare.
06/wsj_0687:And today, many of their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren remain on welfare. 
06/wsj_0687:Farmers in the Midwest and other areas have suffered, but those along the Mississippi continue to prosper with holdings that were built with the sweat of men and women living in economic slavery.
06/wsj_0687:And when they were no longer needed, they were turned loose unprepared to build lives of their own. 
06/wsj_0687:Because the cycle of poverty along the lower Mississippi goes back so many generations, breaking this cycle will be next to impossible.
06/wsj_0687:The people of the Delta are waiting for that big factory to open, river traffic to increase, government spending to fund job-training programs or public schools to educate apathetic students. 
06/wsj_0687:Coffee-shop chatter does not lend itself to solving the problems of racism, teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance. 
06/wsj_0687:Does the Delta deserve government help in attracting industry when the majority of residents, black and white, do not realize racism alienates potential employers?
06/wsj_0687:Should we focus on the region's infant-mortality rate when the vocal right-wingers and the school boards, mayors and legislators prohibit schools from teaching the two ways (abstinence or contraceptives) of decreasing teen pregnancy?
06/wsj_0687:Your story is an insult to the citizens of the Mississippi Delta.
06/wsj_0687:Many of the problems you presented exist in every part of this country.
06/wsj_0687:For years, we tried to ignore the problem of poverty, and now that it has gotten out of hand it's a new crusade for the media and our Democratic Congress. 
06/wsj_0687:The only difference is, in those cities the poor are housed in high-rise-project apartments each consisting of one room, with rusty pipes called plumbing, rodents and cockroaches everywhere and nonworking elevators -- and with the building patrolled by gangs and drug dealers. 
06/wsj_0687:Then maybe I could stay home and have seven children and watch Oprah Winfrey, like Beulah in the article, instead of having one child and working constantly just to stay above water, like so many families in this country. 
06/wsj_0688:Mobil Corp. is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group, which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the U.S., by as much as 15% as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business. 
06/wsj_0688:Management advised employees Friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by 8%, or 400 people.
06/wsj_0688:The exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul, during which it also lost as many as 400 employees, a company spokesman said in response to questions.
06/wsj_0688:Mobil Exploration & Producing U.S. Inc., the group involved, currently has a work force of somewhat less than 5,000. 
06/wsj_0688:Mobil alluded to the work-force cuts last week when it took a $40 million charge as part of its third-quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring.
06/wsj_0688:Mobil officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year. 
06/wsj_0688:During the coming months, layers of management will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous.
06/wsj_0688:For greater efficiency, employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction, Mobil said. "The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations," said Charles E. Spruell, president of the Mobil unit. 
06/wsj_0688:But the staffs at some of those locations will be slashed while at others the work force will be increased. 
06/wsj_0688:But on the West Coast, where profitable oil production is more likely than in the midcontinent region, the Bakersfield, Calif., office staff of 130 will grow by 175 to 305.
06/wsj_0688:The reorganization will "focus on the value and potential of assets," Mr. Spruell said. 
06/wsj_0689:Wanted: An investment that's as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth getting excited about. 
06/wsj_0689:With $150 billion of CDs maturing this month, a lot of people have been scouring the financial landscape for just such an investment. 
06/wsj_0689:In April, when many of them bought their CDs, six-month certificates were yielding more than 9%; investors willing to look could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts.
06/wsj_0689:And the stock market's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there. 
06/wsj_0689:"If you're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a CD, you're not going to find it," says Washington financial planner Dennis M. Gurtz. 
06/wsj_0689:Short-term municipal bonds, bond funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices they mention -- and not just as a way to get a higher return. 
06/wsj_0689:In particular, advisers say, investors may want to look at securities that reduce the risk that CD holders are confronting right now, of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short-term certificates at lower rates. 
06/wsj_0689:A mix of CDs and other holdings may make the most sense. "People should remember their money isn't all or nothing -- they don't need to be shopping for the one interest-rate-type investment and putting all their money in it," says Bethesda, Md., adviser Karen Schaeffer. 
06/wsj_0689:Here's a look at some of the alternatives: 
06/wsj_0689:Yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on CDs for maturities of perhaps one to five years.
06/wsj_0689:Some of the more cautious CD holders might like "pre-refunded" municipals.
06/wsj_0689:"It's a no-brainer: You don't have to worry about diversification; you don't have to worry about quality," says Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice president of the New York bond firm of Gabriele, Hueglin & Cashman Inc. 
06/wsj_0689:That makes them a reasonable option for investors who will accept some risk of price fluctuation in order to make a bet that interest rates will decline over the next year or so. 
06/wsj_0689:The price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities lengthens. 
06/wsj_0689:Consider, for instance, two bond funds from Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. that were both yielding 8.6% on a recent day.
06/wsj_0689:The Short Term Bond Fund, with an average maturity of 2 1/2 years, would deliver a total return for one year of about 10.6% if rates drop one percentage point and a one-year return of about 6.6% if rates rise by the same amount.
06/wsj_0689:DEFERRED ANNUITIES: These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts: Investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn, but a 10% penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age 59 1/2.
06/wsj_0689:Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities, or certificates of annuity.
06/wsj_0689:Annuities are rarely a good idea at age 35 because of the withdrawal restrictions.
06/wsj_0689:With average maturities of a month or so, money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates, with a slight lag. 
06/wsj_0689:Still, today's highest-yielding money funds may beat CDs over the next year even if rates fall, says Guy Witman, an editor of the Bond Market Advisor newsletter in Atlanta.
06/wsj_0689:Try combining a money fund and an intermediate-term bond fund as a low-risk bet on falling rates, suggests Back Bay Advisors Inc., a mutual fund unit of New England Insurance Co.
06/wsj_0690:The United Kingdom reports came from Dr. Patrick Toseland, head of clinical chemistry at Guy's Hospital in London.
06/wsj_0690:In a telephone interview Friday, Dr. Toseland said the number of sudden, unexplained deaths of diabetics he had seen this year was 17 compared with just two in 1985.
06/wsj_0690:At least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year, he said. 
06/wsj_0690:Dr. Solomon Sobel, director of metabolism and endrocrine drug products for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said FDA officials have discussed Dr. Toseland's findings "fairly intensively." While there have been no reports of similar sudden unexplained deaths among diabetics in the U.S., Dr. Sobel said the FDA plans to examine Dr. Toseland's evidence and is considering its own study here. 
06/wsj_0690:The usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include sweating, anxiety and cramps.
06/wsj_0690:With proper warning, diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or sugary food. "The anecdotal data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid onset of hypoglycemia," Dr. Toseland said. 
06/wsj_0690:At the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Dr. Robert E. Silverman, chief of the diabetes program branch, said no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of 1,500 diabetics that has been under way at NIH for five years.
06/wsj_0690:However, he said officials conducting the study hadn't been looking for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia unawareness. "We are now monitoring for it much more closely," he said. 
06/wsj_0690:The human-based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster, he said. "But we don't believe there is enough of a difference to be clinically significant," Dr. Sobel said. 
06/wsj_0690:Reports of Dr. Toseland's findings in the British press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there.
06/wsj_0690:Both the British Diabetic Association and the Committee on Safety in Medicines -- Britain's equivalent of the U.S. FDA -- recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support Dr. Toseland's findings.
06/wsj_0690:"A loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used," the American association said. 
06/wsj_0690:The FDA already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced with human insulin than with animal-based products. 
06/wsj_0690:Lilly officials said they had seen reports of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin, but didn't know if the problem had caused any deaths.
06/wsj_0690:Dr. Leigh Thompson, a Lilly group vice president, said the company's clinical trials of both its animal and human-based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product. 
06/wsj_0690:Dr. Toseland said most of the British diabetics who died had been taking a human-based insulin made by Novo/Nordisk, a Danish manufacturer.
06/wsj_0690:None of the diabetics were using Lilly's insulin. 
06/wsj_0692:This won't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures.
06/wsj_0692:These procedures consume millions of man-hours of labor and produce tons of paper, and each year, their end product -- the Five Year Defense Plan -- promptly melts away. 
06/wsj_0692:That puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others: bean counters, budgeteers, and pork-barrelers.
06/wsj_0692:And as a result -- as the recent vote by the House to undo Mr. Cheney's program terminations suggests -- the preservation of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense "strategy." 
06/wsj_0692:Strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process.
06/wsj_0692:They ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program.
06/wsj_0692:This kind of contingency analysis is common in war planning and business planning.
06/wsj_0692:The Pentagon argues that the negative wedge is the net effect of $22 billion in the as-yet unidentified procurement reductions that it intends to find in future years and $23 billion in an "above guidance" management reserve that accounts for undefined programs that will materialize in the future. 
06/wsj_0692:Most forecasters, including those in the Congressional Budget Office, assume inflation will be in excess of 4% in each of those five years.
06/wsj_0692:The graph on the right (which assumes a 4% rate of inflation), places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 30, 1989).
06/wsj_0692:This scenario has been the rough position of the U.S. Senate since 1985, and it reduces the baseline by $106 billion between 1990 and 1994. 
06/wsj_0692:Scenario 3, the "Current Dollar Freeze," has been the approximate position of the House of Representatives for about four years.
06/wsj_0692:It freezes the budget at its current level, and forces the Pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994.
06/wsj_0692:Finally, Scenario 4 reduces the budget by 2% per year for the next five years -- a total reduction of $287 billion.
06/wsj_0692:This can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction, perhaps driven by the sequestering effects of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union. 
06/wsj_0692:The strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario, maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses.
06/wsj_0692:They would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan -- including the assumptions made, an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations, the impact on national security, and the best strategy for working around these limitations. 
06/wsj_0692:This exercise would reveal the true cost of a particular program by forcing the strategists to make hard decisions.
06/wsj_0692:These trade-offs would evolve priorities by revealing when the cost of the B-2 became prohibitive. 
06/wsj_0692:Some may be tempted to argue that the idea of a strategic review merely resurrects the infamous Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) concept of the Carter administration.
06/wsj_0692:But ZBB did not involve the strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and therefore degenerated into a bean-counting drill driven by budget politics.
06/wsj_0692:Anyway, ZBB's procedures were so cumbersome that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of marginalia.
06/wsj_0692:It would be run by the joint chiefs under simple directions: Produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the Secretary of Defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve U.S. goals. 
06/wsj_0692:This argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the Pentagon and Congress, and unfortunately, there is some truth to it.
06/wsj_0692:Strategy is not a game between the Pentagon and Congress; it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternatives.
06/wsj_0692:Strategy is not a separate event in an idealized sequence of discrete events; it is a way of thinking that neutralizes threats to our interests in a manner consistent with our financial, cultural and physical limitations. 
06/wsj_0692:This is a condensed version of an essay that will appear in the January issue of the Naval Institute Proceedings.
06/wsj_0692:The views expressed do not reflect the official policy of the Department of Defense. 
06/wsj_0693:While Wall Street's tough times and lower U.S. interest rates continue to undermine the dollar, weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors. "By default," the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days, says Francoise Soares-Kemp, a foreign-exchange adviser at Credit Suisse. "We're close to the bottom" of the near-term ranges, she contends. 
06/wsj_0693:In Tokyo Monday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.70 yen, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 142.75 yen. 
06/wsj_0693:The dollar began Friday on a firm note, gaining against all major currencies in Tokyo dealings and early European trading despite reports that the Bank of Japan was seen unloading dollars around 142.70 yen.
06/wsj_0693:The rise came as traders continued to dump the pound after the sudden resignation Thursday of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. 
06/wsj_0693:But once the pound steadied with help from purchases by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the dollar was dragged down, traders say, by the stock-market slump that left the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a loss of 17.01 points. 
06/wsj_0693:With the stock market wobbly and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of U.S. economic weakness and the recent decline in U.S. interest rates that has diminished the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments, traders say the dollar is still in a precarious position. "They'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar," says James Scalfaro, a foreign-exchange marketing representative at Bank of Montreal. 
06/wsj_0693:Sterling plunged about four cents Thursday and hit the week's low of $1.5765 when Mr. Lawson resigned from his six-year post because of a policy squabble with other cabinet members. 
06/wsj_0693:Although the Bank of England's tight monetary policy has fueled worries that Britain's slowing economy is headed for a recession, it is widely believed that Mr. Lawson's willingness to prop up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent weeks.
06/wsj_0693:"It's fair to say there are more risks for the pound under Major than there were under Lawson," says Malcolm Roberts, a director of international bond market research at Salomon Brothers in London. 
06/wsj_0693:But some other analysts have a stormier forecast for the pound, particularly because Britain's inflation is hovering at a relatively lofty annual rate of about 7.6% and the nation is burdened with a struggling government and large current account and trade deficits. 
06/wsj_0693:If the pound falls closer to 2.80 marks, the Bank of England may raise Britain's base lending rate by one percentage point to 16%, says Mr. Rendell.
06/wsj_0693:But such an increase, he says, could be viewed by the market as "too little too late." The Bank of England indicated its desire to leave its monetary policy unchanged Friday by declining to raise the official 15% discount-borrowing rate that it charges discount houses, analysts say. 
06/wsj_0693:Pound concerns aside, the lack of strong buying interest in the yen is another boon for the dollar, many traders say. 
06/wsj_0693:The dollar has a "natural base of support" around 140 yen because the Japanese currency hasn't been purchased heavily in recent weeks, says Ms. Soares-Kemp of Credit Suisse.
06/wsj_0694:We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the "Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989" was "crafted primarily by Democratic Senators Kennedy and Harkin" with a premise "based on the presumption that most Americans are hostile to the disabled. . . ." Perhaps even more offensive is the statement, "It is surprising that George Bush and the White House inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy." 
06/wsj_0694:This legislation was not drafted by a handful of Democratic "do-gooders." Quite the contrary -- it results from years of work by members of the National Council on the Handicapped, all appointed by President Reagan.
06/wsj_0694:The opposite is true: It's the product of many meetings with administration officials, Senate staffers, advocates, and business and transportation officials.
06/wsj_0694:Many congressmen are citing the compromise on the "Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989" as a model for bipartisan deliberations. 
06/wsj_0694:Most National Council members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with disabilities.
06/wsj_0695:A group of investors led by Giant Group Ltd. and its chairman, Burt Sugarman, said it filed with federal antitrust regulators for clearance to buy more than 50% of the stock of Rally's Inc., a fast-food company based in Louisville, Ky. 
06/wsj_0695:The company went public earlier this month, offering 1,745,000 shares of common stock at $15 a share.
06/wsj_0695:The group currently holds 3,027,330 Rally's shares, or 45.2% of its commmon shares outstanding.
06/wsj_0695:Giant Group owned 22% of Rally's shares before the initial public offering. 
06/wsj_0695:A second group of three company directors, aligned with Rally's founder James Patterson, also is seeking control of the fast-food chain.
06/wsj_0695:It is estimated that the Patterson group controls more than 40% of Rally's stock. 
06/wsj_0695:For the year ended July 2, Rally had net income of $2.4 million, or 34 cents a share, on revenue of $52.9 million. 
06/wsj_0696:Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
06/wsj_0697:The offer would give the transaction an indicated value of $189 million, based on the 18.9 million shares the group doesn't already own.
06/wsj_0697:DPC holds about 7.8% of Dataproducts' shares. 
06/wsj_0697:Lawyers representing DPC declined to elaborate, saying they didn't have a final copy of the filing.
06/wsj_0697:Dataproducts had sought a buyer for several months, but it is now in the midst of a restructuring plan and management says the company is no longer for sale. 
06/wsj_0698:Appalachian Power Co., a subsidiary of American Electric Power Co., said it will redeem on Dec. 1 the entire $44.2 million of its 12 7/8% first mortgage bonds due 2013. 
06/wsj_0698:The redemption price will be 109.66% of the principal amount of the bonds, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. 
07/wsj_0700:But securities regulators now say privately that it isn't likely to start until the first quarter of next year. 
07/wsj_0700:Analysts and financial officials in the British colony consider the new contract essential to the revival of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange, which has never fully recovered from the October 1987 crash.
07/wsj_0700:It is almost a carbon copy of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Eurodollar contract, which is based on the three-month Eurodollar rate, the rate paid on U.S.-dollar deposits in London banks. 
07/wsj_0700:If the contract is as successful as some expect, it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in Hong Kong. "The contract is definitely important to the exchange," says Robert Gilmore, executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission. 
07/wsj_0700:Two years ago, the futures exchange was the envy of other would-be futures centers.
07/wsj_0700:In the case of stock-index and interest-rate futures, the instruments are given an underlying cash value and are settled in cash.} 
07/wsj_0700:Volume for the entire month of September totaled only 21,687 contracts, compared with a daily average of 27,000 in the month before the 1987 crash. 
07/wsj_0700:Despite the thin trading, and after two painful years of restructuring, the futures market has shown itself to be resilient in two recent tests.
07/wsj_0700:"There was no problem at all," says Douglas Ford, chief executive officer of the futures exchange. 
07/wsj_0700:Most important to the contract's success is the commitment of Hong Kong's big financial institutions, especially the two leaders, Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. and the local subsidiary of Britain's Standard Chartered Bank PLC.
07/wsj_0700:"If those two banks are there, then the balance of the banking institutions will be there," says Mr. Gilmore, the Securities and Futures Commission official. 
07/wsj_0700:Colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous Hong Kong-dollar exposure.
07/wsj_0700:Even though the currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar, with a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.8 to the American currency, the U.S. and Hong Kong economies don't always move in lock step, making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go. 
07/wsj_0700:The Hibor contract "solves quite a bit of the problem of interest-rate risk in the interbank market," says Eric Cheng, a director of James Capel (Far East) Ltd., the Hong Kong arm of the British brokerage firm. 
07/wsj_0700:Companies and financial institutions familiar with Hong Kong remain wary of trading in its futures market. 
07/wsj_0700:Exchange officials also point out that Hibor futures were designed for institutions and corporations, not for the type of small individual investors who were very active in Hang Seng index futures and defaulted in the 1987 crash.
07/wsj_0700:Mr. Cheng says the low margin required for trading futures attracted a lot of small investors before the 1987 crash who didn't realize that their risk was virtually unlimited. 
07/wsj_0700:But many bankers remain nervous, especially as the start-up of the contract continues to be delayed. 
07/wsj_0701:Two of Japan's largest paper manufacturers, Oji Paper Co. and Jujo Paper Co., posted unconsolidated pretax profit gains from a year earlier for the first half ended Sept. 30, on continuing robust domestic demand for paper products. 
07/wsj_0701:Oji Paper, the nation's largest in terms of sales, said its pretax profit rose 1.5% to 23.11 billion yen (US$163.3 million) from 22.76 billion yen. 
07/wsj_0701:For the full fiscal year ending next March, Oji predicted that total sales of 477.00 billion yen, up from 420.68 billion yen in the previous fiscal year.
07/wsj_0701:General paper product sales, including newsprints and other papers, accounting for the bulk of sales, rose to 157.78 billion yen from 143.88 billion yen. 
07/wsj_0702:Unocal Corp. 's decision to put its Norwegian oil and gas interests up for sale earlier this week is another step in the company's strategic review of its properties, and shows that few of them are sacred cows. 
07/wsj_0702:The company declined to estimate the value of the Norwegian holding.
07/wsj_0702:The proposed transaction is the latest in a redeployment of assets by the Los Angeles-based oil company that has included the $200 million sale of its headquarters property and the pending sale of half of its Chicago refinery and related marketing operations to Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. 
07/wsj_0702:Mr. Nowak said he attaches particular importance to the proposed sale because it suggests that the company is willing to sell oil and gas assets that aren't part of its major strategic strengths. 
07/wsj_0702:Unocal said it expects to complete the sale of its Unocal Norge A/S unit by next March or April.
07/wsj_0702:The field is currently being developed and is slated to start production by the end of the year.
07/wsj_0703:In September, the number of jobless rose 0.1% from the previous month to 2.5 million on a seasonally adjusted basis.

07/wsj_0707:South Africa's current account surplus swelled to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of between five billion and six billion rand ($1.9 billion and $2.28 billion) in the third quarter, Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said.

07/wsj_0712:The Consumer Price Index "A", which measures price changes for the 50% of urban households that spend between 2,000 Hong Kong dollars (US$256.18) and HK$6,499 a month, edged up 1.5% in September from August. 
07/wsj_0712:Index "B", which monitors price changes for the 30% of urban households that spend between HK$6,500 and HK$9,999 a month, rose 9.9% last month from a year earlier and was up 1.3% from the preceding month. 
07/wsj_0712:September's Hang Seng Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes for the 10% of urban households spending HK$10,000 and HK$24,999 a month, was up 11% from a year ago and up 1.3% from August. 
07/wsj_0713:West German and French authorities have cleared Dresdner Bank AG's takeover of a majority stake in Banque Internationale de Placement (BIP), Dresdner Bank said. 
07/wsj_0713:The approval, which had been expected, permits West Germany's second-largest bank to acquire shares of the French investment bank. 
07/wsj_0713:In a first step, Dresdner Bank will buy 32.99% of BIP for 1,015 French francs ($162) a share, or 528 million francs ($84.7 million).
07/wsj_0714:Furukawa Electric Co., one of Japan's leading electric wire and cable manufacturers, said unconsolidated pretax profit in the fiscal first half ended Sept. 30 fell 5.3% to 6.11 billion yen ($43.1 million) from 6.45 billion yen a year earlier. 
07/wsj_0714:Sales by category rose 24% to 35.23 billion yen, reflecting increased production in automobile, airconditioner and electric machine industries, which are major users of wire and cable products. 
07/wsj_0715:West Germany's cost-of-living index rose a preliminary 0.3% in October from September and was up 3.3% from a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said. 
07/wsj_0715:The increase follows a monthly rise of 0.2% in September from August. 
07/wsj_0715:Preliminary cost-of-living data for the current month are calculated based on inflation data from the four largest West German states -- Baden-Wuerttemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria and Hesse. 
07/wsj_0716:The Philippine government awarded Finland's Outokumpu Oy the contract to upgrade the facilities of Philippine Associated Smelting & Refining Corp., according to documents from National Development Corp., one of Philippine company's owners. 
07/wsj_0716:The project costs $46.8 million, and is intended to boost the company's production capacity by 25% to 34,500 metric tons of copper cathode a year. 
07/wsj_0717:September sales at major Japanese retail stores rose 9.4% from a year earlier to 1.388 trillion yen ($9.81 billion), marking the fifth-consecutive monthly increase, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry announced. 
07/wsj_0717:A ministry official said the growth leads to the conclusion the adverse effects of a consumption tax introduced in April have diminished. 
07/wsj_0718:Brockville is about 100 miles east of Toronto. 
07/wsj_0718:Shell Canada, an oil and gas producer and marketer, is a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, an Anglo-Dutch concern. 
07/wsj_0719:They say the recent market volatility has underscored the shortcomings of the way many European exchanges trade stocks. 
07/wsj_0719:The weaknesses of Continental exchanges are driving some fund managers to switch business to stocks traded on London's stock exchange, which quotes firm trading prices for about 350 blue-chip issues from 12 major countries. 
07/wsj_0719:"I'm not saying London covered itself in glory, but the events of the past week have certainly exposed Europe's weaknesses," says Stewart Gilchrist, a director of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers in Glasgow, Scotland, which manages about #6 billion ($9.63 billion) in institutional money.
07/wsj_0719:He says the problems on European exchanges included market-system breakdowns, delayed execution of buy and sell orders and trading suspensions. "The events strengthen London's hand in becoming the center for trading European stocks," Mr. Gilchrist says. 
07/wsj_0719:Unable to unload a large block of a French blue-chip company's shares in Paris for two days last week, a frustrated Scottish Amicable fund manager finally tossed down her phone in disgust and called James Capel & Co., a London brokerage firm.
07/wsj_0719:In Brussels, which recently spent millions of dollars on a computer-assisted trading system, disgusted traders watched helplessly as a software failure before opening on Manic Monday prevented trading for two days.
07/wsj_0719:By Wednesday, frustrated Belgian brokers reopened the market by using the time-honored method of quoting stocks with chalk on a blackboard.
07/wsj_0719:The Belgian computer system finally was repaired and restarted on Tuesday of this week, with the aid of Toronto Stock Exchange officials who developed the system. 
07/wsj_0719:In Frankfurt, which only has a two-hour daily stock-trading session even in the best of times, stocks didn't open for the first 45 minutes because of order imbalances that brokers blame on a wave of sell orders from small investors. 
07/wsj_0719:As banks processed six-foot telexes of sell orders, the crush led to Manic Monday's worst decline: German stocks ended down 13%.
07/wsj_0719:"Belgium was closed for two days, France closed for a couple of hours, Germany was stuck.
07/wsj_0719:On Manic Monday, the volume of German shares traded in London more than tripled to 2.2 million, and the volume of French shares rose 48%. (By comparison, German domestic stock volume in Frankfurt only doubled that day.) 
07/wsj_0719:For one thing, the size of the affected market is enormous -- the European stock markets account for some 22.5% of global stock market capitalization, with an estimated value of $2.175 trillion, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International.
07/wsj_0719:The Continental markets alone contribute about 14.3% of estimated world market capitalization of $9.671 trillion. 
07/wsj_0719:Though the widely traded shares that are quoted in London account for only a small portion of those totals, they still are the most closely watched stocks and are often viewed as a barometer for the local markets generally. 
07/wsj_0719:Rather, there increasingly is a group of international brokerage and trading firms that operate in most European financial centers -- including European giants such as Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank, as well as Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. of the U.S. and Japan's Nomura Securities Co. 
07/wsj_0719:And senior officials of two U.S. securities houses say they switched trades in European stocks to the London market last week when they couldn't unwind positions on the Continent. 
07/wsj_0719:Meantime, brokers on the Continent are worried, too, mostly by the potential loss of business. "I would be much happier if this volume {in German stocks} were in Frankfurt rather than London," says Dieter Bauernfeind, head of international equity sales at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt.
07/wsj_0719:Already the Germans appear to be acting; at a special meeting on the day of the decline, directors of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange voted to extend their trading hours, although they haven't decided when or by how much.
07/wsj_0719:A Frankfurt exchange official, acknowledging the brokers' anxieties, says the market still feels it "functioned OK during this crash." The Dutch, who had some trading problems because of insufficient computer capacity, say new equipment to solve the problems ought to be installed within a month. 
07/wsj_0719:But it's just one of those things that happened.
07/wsj_0719:Investors can be assured now that this kind of problem can never occur again." 
07/wsj_0719:"They all said they invested huge amounts of money.
07/wsj_0721:Trinova Corp. said it will resume buying back as many as three million of its common shares under a program announced two years ago. 
07/wsj_0721:The company said it isn't making a commitment to purchase a specific number of shares. 
07/wsj_0722:Calgene, an agricultural biotechnology concern, said initial work will concentrate on a proprietary strain of Bacillus subtilis which has shown promise for controlling aflatoxin.
07/wsj_0722:The strain was discovered by Morinaga & Co. and licensed to Gustafson, a unit of Uniroyal Chemical Co. 
07/wsj_0722:The recent appearance of aflatoxin in such foods as corn and peanut butter has sparked public concern and consumer scrutiny of food handling and storage procedures. 
07/wsj_0723:European Community employers fear that the EC Commission's plans for a "charter of fundamental social rights" is a danger to industrial competitiveness. 
07/wsj_0723:"We don't want Brussels deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful," said Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of the employers' confederation Unice. 
07/wsj_0723:Unice -- an acronym for the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe -- fears that the charter will force EC countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations.
07/wsj_0723:France will propose a slightly watered-down version of the charter to be discussed by EC social-affairs ministers on Monday, officials said.
07/wsj_0723:But the cosmetic changes aren't expected to win over Britain. "We still have serious differences with the text," a British official said, because it provides for a "regulation of the labor market." 
07/wsj_0723:Indeed, lower wages -- in Greece, they are a third of the EC average -- aren't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries.
07/wsj_0723:The charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers' fundamental rights, without seeking to impose any norms. 
07/wsj_0723:A key provision in the current version of the charter would give the commission a mandate to produce an "action program" detailing on what points EC member states would be required to comply with the goals set out in the charter.
07/wsj_0723:This provision lies at the heart of the British and Unice fears of "social engineering" by the commission. 
07/wsj_0723:One possible political solution, an EC official said, would be for the commission to present the action program in late November, before the adoption of the charter at a summit of EC governments on Dec. 8 and 9.
07/wsj_0723:France's Socialist government, which currently holds the council's rotating presidency, is committed to having the charter adopted by all 12 EC states before the end of 1989 -- the bicentennial of the French revolution and its "Universal Declaration of Human Rights." 
07/wsj_0724:Bruno DeGol, chairman of DeGol Brothers Lumber, Gallitzin, Pa., was named a director of this bank-holding company, expanding the board to 11 members. 
07/wsj_0725:They pile out of their truck and furiously begin twisting together steel pipes linking a giant storage tank to the Sharpshooter, a freshly drilled oil well two miles deep. 
07/wsj_0725:After a three-year nightmare of uncertain oil prices, draconian budget cuts and sweeping layoffs, fear is finally leaving the oil patch.
07/wsj_0725:Mideast politics have calmed down and the squabbling within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seems under control for now. "The fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices," says Victor Burk, an Arthur Andersen & Co. oil expert.
07/wsj_0725:After years of wild swings, oil prices over the last 12 months have settled at around $15 to $20 a barrel. 
07/wsj_0725:The current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady, strong demand and continued relative harmony within OPEC, producer of more than 40% of the non-Communist world's crude.
07/wsj_0725:That in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic," says Glenn Cox, the president of Phillips Petroleum Co. 
07/wsj_0725:The same roller-coaster prices that halted U.S. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation's inflation rate, the trade deficit and oil users' corporate and personal budgets.
07/wsj_0725:Corporate planners can plan again. "Management doesn't want surprises," notes Jack Zaves, who, as fuel-services director at American Airlines, buys some 2.4 billion gallons of jet fuel a year.
07/wsj_0725:And consumers "should be comfortable," adds W. Henson Moore, U.S. deputy secretary of energy. "I don't see anything on the horizon that could lead to a precipitous rise in the price." 
07/wsj_0725:Saudi Arabia, OPEC's kingpin, abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota-cheaters.
07/wsj_0725:OPEC Secretary-General Subroto explains: Consumers offer security of markets, while OPEC provides security of supply. "This is an opportune time to find mutual ways {to prevent} price shocks from happening again," he says. 
07/wsj_0725:OPEC has repeatedly raised its self-imposed production ceiling to legitimize some of that unauthorized output. 
07/wsj_0725:Oil ministers now hope to solve the issue for good through an Iranian proposal that gives a larger share of output to countries with surplus capacity and reduces the shares of those that can't produce more anyway.
07/wsj_0725:Patrick J. Early, president of Amoco Corp. 's oil-production unit, says that despite recent stability, he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending.
07/wsj_0725:The view of some others in Big Oil, he maintains, "is very much {similar to} Amoco's outlook." Just this week Mobil Corp. disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations. 
07/wsj_0725:Out here on the Querecho Plains of New Mexico, however, the mood is more upbeat; trucks rumble along the dusty roads and burly men in hard hats sweat and swear through the afternoon sun.
07/wsj_0725:Santa Fe Energy Co., a unit of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Co., bought from Amoco the rights that allowed it to drill the Sharpshooter.
07/wsj_0725:A mile and a half away looms the 150-foot-tall rig of the Sniper, due to be pumping by December. "Talk is that everybody is going to drill more wells," says foreman Tommy Folsom. 
07/wsj_0725:Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. became the partner, ponying up more than half of the $600,000 in drilling and start-up costs.
07/wsj_0725:Mitchell will get a half-interest in the oil. "A kind of no-mistakes mentality" had been stifling activity, says Don Covey, Mitchell's oil exploration chief.
07/wsj_0725:One attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the bargain-basement cost of drilling and equipment, reflecting service companies' hunger for work.
07/wsj_0725:One of its wells, in southwestern Oklahoma, is a "rank wildcat," a risky well where oil previously hasn't been found. 
07/wsj_0725:"At this price, $18 plus or minus, and with costs being significantly less than they were several years ago, the economics are pretty good," says George Kadane, head of the company. "If you know you've got stability in price, you can do things you wouldn't do with the volatility of the past few years." 
07/wsj_0725:In the Gulf of Mexico, a boat to deliver supplies to offshore rigs now costs around $3,000 a day, up nearly 60% since June.
07/wsj_0725:At the bottom of the slump, Schlumberger Inc. was discounting 75% on an electronic evaluation of a well; now it discounts about 50%, drillers say. 
07/wsj_0725:Most oil companies, when they set exploration and production budgets for this year, forecast revenue of $15 for each barrel of crude produced.
07/wsj_0725:It says 40% of those surveyed report that 1989 exploration spending will exceed 1988's. 
07/wsj_0725:Texaco, thinking in terms of $18-to-$19 oil for 1990, may raise spending, especially for low-risk prospects, an official says.
07/wsj_0725:Contractors such as Parker Drilling Co. are raising cash again through stock offerings, and for the first time in years, two oil-service companies recently went public. (They are Grace Energy Corp. of Dallas and Marine Drilling Co. of Houston.) 
07/wsj_0725:Norman Young, a "mud-logger" at the Sniper well, has worked all but about nine days of this year.
07/wsj_0725:A native of the area, he is back now after riding the oil-field boom to the top, then surviving the bust running an Oklahoma City convenience store. "First year I came back there wasn't any work," he says. "I think it's on the way back now.
07/wsj_0725:Business has been good enough that he just took a spur-of-the-moment weekend trip to the mountain area of Cloudcroft, something "I haven't done in years." 
07/wsj_0725:Only 14,505 wells, including 4,900 dry holes, were drilled for oil and natural gas in the U.S. in the first nine months of the year, down 22.4% from the like 1988 period. 
07/wsj_0725:And the number of rigs active in the U.S. is inching up.
07/wsj_0725:According to Baker Hughes Inc., 992 rotary rigs were at work in the U.S. last week, up from the year-ago count of 933. (In 1981, before the bust, the rig count was above 4,000.) Global offshore-rig use shows a similar upward trend. 
07/wsj_0726:Eight people, including a supervisor of Security Pacific National Bank's central vault, were arrested in an investigation of an alleged drug money-laundering operation. 
07/wsj_0726:The U.S. Attorney's office filed a criminal complaint against six bank employees charging them with conspiracy in the scheme, which apparently was capable of handling millions of dollars a week by funneling cash through fictitious bank accounts.
07/wsj_0726:Walter S. Fisher, executive vice president and general auditor of the bank's parent, Security Pacific Corp., said no bank funds were at risk during the investigation. 
07/wsj_0726:Arrested were Jose O. Lopez, 27 years old, of Whittier, Calif., the vault supervisor; Carlos O. Huerta, 29, of La Puente; Luis A. Arroyo, 36, of Los Angeles; Ignacio Rojas Jr., 32, of Baldwin Park; Doris Moreno, 37, of Bell Gardens; and Ana L. Azucena, 27, of Huntington Park.
07/wsj_0726:Geno M. Apicella, 27, of Los Angeles, and Terrell N. Madison, 27, of Hawthorne, were also charged with participating in the conspiracy. 
07/wsj_0726:Each defendant faces a possible sentence of 20 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
07/wsj_0727:Such an offer could torpedo a plan by Lion Nathan Ltd. of New Zealand to acquire half the brewing interests.
07/wsj_0727:But it would probably increase the amount of cash that debt-ridden Bond Corp. would earn from the transaction. 
07/wsj_0727:Australia's National Companies and Securities Commission said it will allow S.A. Brewing to acquire an option on as much as 20% of Bell Resources Ltd., a unit of Bond Corp. that is in the process of acquiring Bond Corp. 's brewing businesses for 2.5 billion Australian dollars (US$1.93 billion). 
07/wsj_0727:S.A. Brewing, which is 20%-owned by Elders IXL Ltd., Australia's largest brewer, will make a takeover offer for all of Bell Resources if it exercises the option, the corporate regulators said in a statement. 
07/wsj_0727:Bond Corp., a brewing, property, media and resources concern controlled by financier Alan Bond, is selling many of its assets to reduce an A$6.9 billion debt. 
07/wsj_0728:Contrary to what might be expected based on the headline on John R. Dorfman's recent Money Matters article ("Pros Hit Theorists Right Where It Hurts" Oct. 3), I was able to stand proudly before my undergraduate finance students and proclaim that the findings of your yearlong experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what they have been taught in the classroom.
07/wsj_0728:In particular, I do not find the fact that your group of pros' monthly selections of four stocks outperforms the market in general to be inconsistent with market efficiency. 
07/wsj_0728:Accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation.
07/wsj_0728:If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return, I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk, as I am sure your pros do.
07/wsj_0728:A four-stock portfolio is still exposed to a great deal of unnecessary risk.
07/wsj_0728:Mr. Dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of dart throwers would have accumulated only $112,383 by randomly selecting four new stocks to be held in a portfolio each month. 
07/wsj_0728:The fact that stock pickers have bested a randomly selected portfolio in eight of 12 months has no bearing on the efficient-market theory. 
07/wsj_0729:Peter W. Likins, president of Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa., was elected a director of this maker of industrial motion-control parts and systems.
07/wsj_0730:Most of the cases have been in California, where one agent was stabbed and another was shot and killed. 
07/wsj_0730:Los Angeles police say the thieves seem to be part of a crime network that knows how to convert blank tickets into real ones.
07/wsj_0730:Police say the robberies are usually pulled off by two to five men, who walk into the agencies near closing or lunch time, when few employees are there. "They looked like ordinary vacationers at first," says Willy LLerena, owner of Travel Air Service in Monte Bello, Calif., describing five men who entered his agency last June. 
07/wsj_0730:As word of the crime spree has spread, many agents have started changing their open-door policies.
07/wsj_0730:At El Monte Travel Center in El Monte, Calif., customers now can get in only through a buzzer and lock system. "It's hard to deal with clients this way in a service business," says Ralph "Bud" Conner, owner of the agency, which was robbed of 180 blank tickets and $850 last month. "But we're just too nervous." 
07/wsj_0730:Agents say airlines, which track ticket numbers of all stolen tickets, should be doing more to catch the thieves by confiscating the tickets when they're used. "They have the most sophisticated computers in the world," says Mr. LLerena. "They ought to be able to do this." 
07/wsj_0730:The law -- the first of its kind -- requires car rental companies in Texas to charge only "reasonable" rates for collision-damage waiver insurance.
07/wsj_0730:A spokesman for Hertz Corp. acknowledges, "The waiver isn't a source of protection for consumers, but a source of revenue." But Hertz points out that at least it's now charging only $3.95 a day in Texas, while some competitors are charging $6.99.
07/wsj_0730:This happens because the FAA doesn't have any rules on duty time for flight attendants; by contrast, it strictly restricts duty time for pilots and air traffic controllers, usually to a maximum of 10 consecutive hours. 
07/wsj_0730:"As far as the FAA is concerned," says Matt Finucane, air safety director at the Association of Flight Attendants, "flight attendants can work an unlimited number of hours." 
07/wsj_0730:For instance, tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation. "At the end of their day, they are zombies," says John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute, a public-interest group in Worthington, Ohio. "They have to work such long hours and then we expect them to be heroes if there's an evacuation." In response to the study, the FAA says it is considering changing its policy -- or lack of it -- on flight attendants.
07/wsj_0732:Why do you continually ignore the salubrious effects of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation?
07/wsj_0732:You virtually ignore the tax-reducing power of indexation, which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate. 
07/wsj_0732:The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation: tax rate, times inflation rate, times basis for the gain.
07/wsj_0732:Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation, indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the 19.6% rate without indexation.
07/wsj_0732:But what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after 1991.
07/wsj_0732:A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation, and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation.
07/wsj_0732:Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest? 
07/wsj_0732:Real, aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of 1% or 2% a year.
07/wsj_0732:The capital-gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the U.S. economy, the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates, weak capital formation and high capital costs. 
07/wsj_0733:Isaac Hersly, 41 years old, was elected president and chief operating officer of this designer and marketer of graphics, video, cable and other television-related equipment.
07/wsj_0733:Mr. Hersly formerly was group vice president of marketing and product planning for Chyron and president of the telesystems and video products division. 
07/wsj_0734:Grace, a maker of specialty chemicals that already owned about 30% of closely held Sierra, said it owns a 49% stake in the new company.
07/wsj_0734:The business is expected to have sales of about $100 million in 1990, Grace said.
07/wsj_0735:The Financial Accounting Standards Board said it will soon issue a rule requiring disclosure about the financial risk of certain financial instruments. 
07/wsj_0735:But the chief rule-making body for accountants backed off one part of its original proposal made earlier this year that would have required a breakdown of certain balance-sheet items related to off-balance sheet instruments. 
07/wsj_0735:The balance-sheet detail was opposed by many banks and thrifts that felt the cost of supplying such data wasn't worth the value of the disclosures. 
07/wsj_0735:Under the initial proposal, for example, banks would have been required to disclose that portion of allowances for loan losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted.
07/wsj_0735:The final rule won't require such a breakdown of the allowances for loan losses, which appears on the balance sheet. 
07/wsj_0735:It will require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments. 
07/wsj_0735:The rule will require companies with financial instruments that have off-balance sheet risks to disclose data about the value and terms of the instruments, any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform, and the company's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument. 
07/wsj_0735:But he noted that the initial effective date of the earlier proposal had been delayed by six months.
07/wsj_0736:Poughkeepsie Savings Bank said a plan to sell its South Carolina branch offices to First Citizens Bank, of Columbia, S.C., fell through. 
07/wsj_0736:Poughkeepsie also expects to post a one-time charge of $8.3 million, resulting in a net loss for the third quarter.
07/wsj_0736:The charge represents a write-down of the goodwill associated with Poughkeepsie's investment in the banks it is trying to sell and its North Carolina branches as well. 
07/wsj_0736:Among other reasons, high fees regulators imposed on certain transfers of thrift deposits to commercial banks "substantially altered the economics of the transaction for both parties," Poughkeepsie said. 
07/wsj_0736:In the year-earlier third quarter, Poughkeepsie Savings had net income of $2.8 million, or 77 cents a share. 
07/wsj_0736:The thrift and the holders had suspended their lawsuits as part of the agreement. 
07/wsj_0737:Joe Frank Sanderson Jr. was elected president and chief executive officer of this poultry producer.
07/wsj_0737:The current president and chief operating officer, J. Odell Johnson, was elected to the new position of vice chairman of the board. 
07/wsj_0738:Kinder-Care Inc. was dropped from the consumer services industry group of the Dow Jones Equity Market index because the company split itself in a restructuring.
07/wsj_0739:A potentially safer whooping cough vaccine made by novel genetic engineering techniques was described by a team of Italian, U.S. and Japanese scientists. 
07/wsj_0739:The team reported they managed to induce bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the poisons produced by the bacterium that causes whooping cough.
07/wsj_0739:Laboratory tests showed that non-toxic versions of the poisons are capable of inducing an immunity to whooping cough, the researchers reported in this week's issue of the journal Science. 
07/wsj_0739:The current vaccine for whooping cough, or pertussis, is part of the "DPT" (for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) shot given most infants and young children.
07/wsj_0739:The reactions stem from the fact that the vaccine contains multiple copies of the whole Bordetella pertussis bacterium, which causes whooping cough.
07/wsj_0739:The Italian-led scientific team said they had succeeded in getting bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the pertussis toxin, which could be used as a safe vaccine.
07/wsj_0739:The researchers reported they have been able to pluck the five genes that produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium.
07/wsj_0739:Ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes, minus the one that caused the virulence, would have been transferred to another bacterium, called E. coli, which would then produce a nonvirulent version of the toxin.
07/wsj_0739:But the genes were accompanied by a piece of DNA, called a promoter, that turns the genes on. 
07/wsj_0739:The new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which, because of the mutant virulence gene, was no longer toxic.
07/wsj_0739:Experiments showed that the new, non-virulent toxin is capable of inducing immunity, according to the researchers from the Selavo Research Center in Siena, Italy, the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and the Japanese National Institutes of Health. 
07/wsj_0740:Carl E. Pissocra, president and chief executive officer of Bank One, Dover, has been named regional president, a new post at the bank-holding company.
07/wsj_0740:Dan J. Hartwell, 41, executive vice president of Bank One, Dover, was named president and chief executive of the Dover bank, succeeding Mr. Pissocra.
07/wsj_0741:At a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into West Germany's financial center, the opening of a three-man office on a Frankfurt side street shouldn't attract much attention. 
07/wsj_0741:Unless, of course, it happens to be run by the Rothschilds. 
07/wsj_0741:After an 88-year absence from the birthplace of the family banking empire, the return of the Rothschild group to Frankfurt was greeted by the glare of television lights, curious reporters and a mayoral reception in Town Hall. 
07/wsj_0741:Like other foreign banks establishing a presence here, the family describes its move as a calculated decision to set up a financial services outlet in Europe's largest economy ahead of the integration of European Community markets after 1992.
07/wsj_0741:The original bank in Frankfurt closed in 1901 after the death of Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild, and the family's banking activities focused on London and Paris. 
07/wsj_0741:Baron Elie de Rothschild, the family's elder spokesman, explains that by the end of the 19th century, Berlin had replaced Frankfurt as Germany's financial center.
07/wsj_0741:Much of the family's mystique remained.
07/wsj_0741:The family was in Allied countries during both World War I and the long period of economic strife of the 1920s.
07/wsj_0741:During the Third Reich, the Rothschilds were a target of Nazi propaganda against Jewish financiers.
07/wsj_0741:American journalist William L. Shirer, in his book "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich," wrote of how in Vienna he had witnessed "squads of {Nazi} SS men carting off silver, tapestries, paintings and other loot from the Rothschild palace." 
07/wsj_0741:"For a member of the Rothschild family, the return to Frankfurt is a very meaningful event, although it might not mean as much to German banking as it means to us," says Baron David de Rothschild, Elie's younger cousin and a partner in Rothschild & Cie.
07/wsj_0741:But the market really isn't going to be stood on its head," said a banker at one of Frankfurt's Big Three banks. 
07/wsj_0741:The return of the Rothschilds is modest.
07/wsj_0741:The new representative office, with one manager and two assistants -- none a member of the Rothschild family -- will carry out no banking operations of its own.
07/wsj_0741:Instead, it is to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on behalf of the family's mainstay banking units: N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd. in London, Rothschild & Cie. in Paris and Rothschild Bank AG in Zurich. 
07/wsj_0741:He left his job as general manager of Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. 's Frankfurt office because, he says, "When the Rothschilds called, I couldn't resist." 
07/wsj_0741:In March, N M Rothschild in London and Rothschild Bank in Zurich showed assets of #4.1 billion ($6.51 billion) and 1.26 billion Swiss francs ($774 million), respectively.
07/wsj_0741:In Europe, the Rothschilds banks are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as European industry restructures ahead of 1992.
07/wsj_0741:The Rothschilds hope to use a long history in private banking and an aura of exclusivity to attract private and institutional investors.
07/wsj_0742:A stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks, such as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
07/wsj_0742:But increasingly, people are questioning that view, and the critics include some of the country's most successful investors.
07/wsj_0742:And Mario Gabelli, another star in the investing world, says, "My gut says the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits." 
07/wsj_0742:And those who remain, he says "will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies." 
07/wsj_0742:Essentially, the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps.
07/wsj_0742:One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market's basic function of raising capital. "Before futures," says New York investor Michael Harkins, "you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any intrinsic value." 
07/wsj_0742:Then, in the space of a 20-minute coffee break, the average rallied almost all of the way back.
07/wsj_0742:Paul Lesutis, who manages more than $3 billion of investments at Provident Capital Management Inc., blames futures markets for leading the way. "The fundamentals don't change in an hour," he says. "I think they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing." 
07/wsj_0742:Index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures -- is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility.
07/wsj_0742:Although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets, John Bachmann, managing partner of Edward D. Jones, says too much liquidity isn't a good thing 
07/wsj_0742:"The kind of instant liquidity that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day.
07/wsj_0742:But stock-index futures have plenty of support.
07/wsj_0742:Louis Margolis, managing director in charge of equity options and futures at Salomon Inc., says that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s, a decade before the advent of futures.
07/wsj_0742:And traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape. "All life is about change -- either you adapt or die," says one Chicago futures trader. "If futures aren't permitted here, we'll take it to Australia or Tokyo." 
07/wsj_0742:Based on yesterday's closing price of the S&P, the average value of one day's trading amounts to $7.6 billion.
07/wsj_0742:If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall, but want to continue owning stocks, they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts. 
07/wsj_0742:Based on yesterday's closing price of the S&P, the average value of one day's trading amounts to $7.6 billion.
07/wsj_0742:If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall, but want to continue owning stocks, they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts. 
07/wsj_0742:And although criticism of futures generally comes from Wall Street, one Chicago futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions. 
07/wsj_0742:Margin requirements for speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are currently about 7%. "For $10 million, you can move $100 million of stocks," a specialist on the Big Board gripes. "That gives futures traders a lot more power." By contrast, an investor in stocks must put up 50% in cash. 
07/wsj_0742:Some critics say futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity, rather than as investments in individual businesses.
07/wsj_0742:Thus, they say, futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market: to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it's needed most. 
07/wsj_0742:The S&P 500 index futures "transferred the identity of 500 stocks into one unit-making them a simple commodity to trade," says George Kegler, senior vice president at A. Webster Dougherty in Philadelphia. "It took away the need to know the bad third-quarter report of IBM, for example," Mr. Kegler says. 
07/wsj_0742:Of course, portfolio trading -- the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks -- also treats stocks as homogenous commodities. "There is a class of investor that wants to be exposed" to the whole market, says Sandip Bhagat, assistant vice president at Travelers Investment Management Co.
07/wsj_0742:Stockholders, as a group, can win, because they own a share of corporate earnings, which can grow and boost stock prices. 
07/wsj_0742:Futures, on the other hand, are a zero sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices. "You don't own anything," says Stephen Boesel, a money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. "You're making a pure bet on the market." 
07/wsj_0743:At issue is an accord dating back to March in which Air France gained access to five domestic French routes under Air Inter's flight numbers and the domestic airline got to fly to five cities outside of France under the flag of Air France.
07/wsj_0743:An Air France spokeswoman said, "we're absolutely ready to study all solutions." An Air Inter spokesman said, "Because they {the EC} have doubts, we will work again on the text and the contents of the accord." 
07/wsj_0744:A state appellate court reinstated the 1987 convictions of Pymm Thermometer Corp. and two of its executives on charges of assault for exposing workers to toxic mercury vapors. 
07/wsj_0744:But the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court held that federal law didn't pre-empt the states from such a prosecution. 
07/wsj_0744:The executives face five to 15 years in prison and fines of $5,000 or double the profit made by failing to comply with the rules.
07/wsj_0744:The company could be fined a maximum of $10,000, or double the profit. 
07/wsj_0745:General Motors Corp. wants to buy as much as 15% of Jaguar PLC, marking its first salvo in a possible full-scale battle against Ford Motor Co. for control of the British car maker. 
07/wsj_0745:GM sought U.S. antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than $15 million worth of Jaguar shares but doesn't own any yet, according to GM officials here and at the company's Detroit headquarters.
07/wsj_0745:"I really don't see the government doing something that Jaguar doesn't want over the next 14 months," said Kenneth Warren, a Conservative member of Parliament and chairman of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry in Britain's House of Commons. "The golden share is a single share, but it is the magic share." 
07/wsj_0745:The government retained the single share after selling its stake in Jaguar in 1984 -- part of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to deflect criticism of privatization.
07/wsj_0745:Ford is willing to bid for 100% of Jaguar's shares if both the government and Jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely.
07/wsj_0745:Ford might succeed because many shareholders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over Jaguar management's handling of its current financial difficulties. 
07/wsj_0745:It has relinquished a golden share only once before -- during British Petroleum Co. 's #2.5 billion ($4 billion) takeover of Britoil PLC in 1988. 
07/wsj_0745:This week, the U.S. auto giant paid for 10 House of Commons members and two House of Lords members to fly to Detroit and tour its operations there.
07/wsj_0745:The Conservatives don't dare jeopardize marginal Tory seats in Coventry, where Jaguar has headquarters, nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to privatize most of Britain's water and electricity industries. 
07/wsj_0746:SKF said demand for the group's main product, rolling bearings, remained favorable in Europe, which accounts for slightly more than two-thirds of group sales.
07/wsj_0746:Analysts said SKF's results for the first nine months lived up to market expectations as brokerage firms had predicted a pretax profit of 1.74 billion to 1.86 billion kronor. 
07/wsj_0746:Sales of rolling bearings increased 19% to 15.7 billion kronor from 13.2 billion kronor in the corresponding period the previous year. 
07/wsj_0747:Many of his views on the protection of wilderness areas, rivers and canyons are now embraced by mainstream, conservative Utahans. 
07/wsj_0747:Recently, some 60 environmental and outdoor groups representing such divergent points of view as the Sierra Club, the League of Women Voters and the National Rifle Association joined together to request a reassessment of the environmentally unsound Central Utah Project.
07/wsj_0747:In one of the most conservative, Republican states in the entire nation, the greening of Robert Redford's neighbors is the real story that Mr. Tomsho missed. 
07/wsj_0747:If Mr. Redford wanted to be accepted by the people of Utah, he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of forcing his personal preferences.
07/wsj_0747:Furthermore, his actions imply that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through power-plant construction, coal mining or to build roads for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment, but it is just fine and dandy for him to transform a mountain high in the Wasatch Range into a ski resort. 
07/wsj_0747:University of Colorado 
07/wsj_0747:Mr. Redford, like it or not, is like a braking system on a runaway truck, kind of slowing it down into control.
07/wsj_0747:Mr. Redford is slowing down a mindless, speeding maniac known as the progress of mankind. 
07/wsj_0748:When President Bush travels to Costa Rica today, he'll go with little of the fanfare that accompanies many of his foreign travels.
07/wsj_0748:Some conservatives say Mr. Bush shouldn't make the trip, during which he will participate in Costa Rica's celebration of 100 years of democracy.
07/wsj_0748:Mr. Windsor, among other analysts connected to the conservative Heritage Foundation, fears the gathering of 18 leaders, mostly from Central American nations, will force Mr. Bush "to explain and redeem himself" in the wake of charges that the U.S. failed to do enough to aid the removal of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. 
07/wsj_0748:At the same time, liberal and moderate Democrats note the irony of Mr. Bush's joining a celebration of Costa Rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in U.S. aid to the tiny country.
07/wsj_0748:Mr. Arias's long-time refusal to support the U.S.'s campaign against leftist Nicaragua earned him the ire of the Reagan White House.
07/wsj_0748:"I think Bush's going there is a helpful sign," said Sen. Terry Sanford (D., N.C.) a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who pushed to provide Costa Rica about the same amount of aid as it received last year.
07/wsj_0748:The administration also made clear its continuing distate for the leftist Nicaraguan government in recent days, endorsing a package of electoral aid to the Nicaraguan opposition, renewing the U.S. trade embargo against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region. 
07/wsj_0748:"Let me say there is a symbolic component to this trip," Secretary of State James Baker told reporters Wednesday. "There won't be any formal resolutions or communiques, I don't think.
07/wsj_0749:In 1987, the Presidents Commission of the NCAA, which oversees most U.S. intercollegiate sports, contracted with the Washington-based American Institutes for Research to do a survey on the college experiences of what the body chooses to call student-athletes.
07/wsj_0749:I suspect I may be one of the few people to have read them all. 
07/wsj_0749:Titled "Comments From Students," it focuses on the real shame of college sports: what happens to young athletes once they enter academe.
07/wsj_0749:They showed that participants in Division I football and men's basketball, the big-time "revenue sports," entered school with poorer high-school grades and test scores than "minor-sport" jocks and students who participated in other extracurricular activities, and they got lower grades once they got there, at least partly because of the athletic demands placed on them. 
07/wsj_0749:The composite portrait that emerges isn't of a pampered jock marking time until he can land a seven-figure pro contract -- he's part of a tiny minority.
07/wsj_0749:Rather, it's of a kid (we're talking about 17 to 22 year olds here) having a tough time making the best of what will probably be his one shot at college. 
07/wsj_0749:The pertinent question, coming at the end of a lengthy, confidential questionnaire, was this: "Are there things about your college life you would like to tell us that we didn't ask about?" Of the almost 3,000 athletes surveyed, 1,240 took the time to respond.
07/wsj_0749:Here are a few of their answers: 
07/wsj_0749:Your coaches demand a lot more out of you even though some of them are not willing to take the time to watch you progress.
07/wsj_0749:-- "The coaches should have a more personal and sympathetic attitude toward the athletes -- not treat us like pieces of meat.
07/wsj_0749:Some days the coaches make you feel as though you are part of a large herd of animals.
07/wsj_0749:In other words, they treat you like a piece of meat." -- Sophomore football player. 
07/wsj_0749:-- "Playing intercollegiate sports doesn't give you a lot of time to spend with others.
07/wsj_0749:We are almost left out of {campus} social activities.
07/wsj_0749:-- "Physical exhaustion and depression are common in my life and in some of my teammates' lives." -- Football player, class unspecified. 
07/wsj_0749:One has to establish one's own identity away from athletics and make athletics only a part, not a whole, of the student-athlete's life." -- Sophomore basketball player. 
07/wsj_0749:The Knight Foundation, of Akron, Ohio, has established a national commission to look into college-sports reform, and the NCAA Presidents Commission earlier this month recommended cutting spring football practice in half, moving the start of basketball practice back by a month and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to 25 games from 28. 
07/wsj_0749:I read that one unnamed athletics director predicted that the basketball-cutback proposal could fail because of "real world" (i.e., economic) considerations. 
07/wsj_0750:Such is the fiber of the wool that woolly intellectuals let fly at gatherings of Harvard University's new Society of Nerds and Geeks, or SONG. SONGsters are mad as heck about campus anti-intellectualism and they aren't going to take it anymore, at least not without trying a few really neat ideas first. 
07/wsj_0750:Some people may think of nerds as calculator-toting, socially awkward individuals with shirt-pocket liners for their pencils and a preoccupation with computers and matters numerical.
07/wsj_0750:But SONG founder Jeremy Kahn, a Harvard junior, thinks of nerds and geeks more as "nonconformists," albeit with a studious bent.
07/wsj_0750:One of the group's first projects is a "procrastination hot line" that students could call when they have an urge to delay studying. 
07/wsj_0750:The club plans to show nerdy movies, such as "Real Genius," in which physics whizzes pop corn with lasers; and naturally, the "Revenge of the Nerds," a tale of college males with runny noses and ill-fitting pants.
07/wsj_0750:One of its "more ambitious goals" is to get Jaime Escalante, the Los Angeles high-school mathematics teacher featured in the film "Stand and Deliver," to come to Harvard for a guest lecture. 
07/wsj_0750:So Mr. Kahn says high priority is being given to creating a computerized matchmaking service "where instead of being matched for eye color, you could be matched for similar intellectual interests." For instance? "I'm a math major, but I want to know about psychobiology.
07/wsj_0751:Dime Savings Bank of New York was cleared by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to acquire Starpointe Savings Bank of Somerset, N.J., the banks said. 
07/wsj_0752:AEP INDUSTRIES Inc. directors authorized a 3-for-2 split of the common, payable Dec. 7 to stock of record Nov. 22.
07/wsj_0752:The split was aimed at boosting the stock's liquidity, said Brendan Barba, chairman of the Moonachie, N.J., maker of plastic film products.
07/wsj_0753:CRESTMONT FEDERAL SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION (Edison, N.J.) -- Lawrence B. Seidman, 41 years old, was named chairman of this savings and loan institution.
07/wsj_0753:Mr. Seidman, a director of Crestmont since July, is general partner of Seidman Financial Associates, which owns 9.89% of Crestmont. 
07/wsj_0755:Environmental concerns are beginning to have as much influence in oil-industry spending plans as the price of crude does. 
07/wsj_0755:In the wake of the Exxon Valdez spill in March, new governmental drilling bans are sharply curtailing exploration in promising locations offshore and in Alaska. 
07/wsj_0755:Over the years, the world's stream of oil has been growing heavier. 
07/wsj_0755:Recently Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, traditional heavy-crude producers, have boasted of new finds of light, low-sulfur oil by their national oil companies.
07/wsj_0755:Typical is Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, Italy's state-owned energy company, which not long ago acquired through its AGIP oil subsidiary a 5% share in the consortium accounting for half of Nigeria's oil output.
07/wsj_0755:Franco Reviglio, ENI chairman, looks for sweeping structural change in the oil industry -- he calls it a "revolution" requiring huge investments -- as a result of environmental issues.
07/wsj_0755:Oil companies world-wide will have "to spend a lot of money for the cleaner fuels that will be required," says John H. Lichtblau, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
07/wsj_0755:Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil.
07/wsj_0755:Similarly, a group of companies led by Chevron Corp. has been unable to pump oil found off the California coast in the early 1980s.
07/wsj_0755:But the push for cleaner fuels is increasing the attractiveness of natural gas.
07/wsj_0755:Activity has revived in the largest U.S. gas-producing regions, such as the Gulf of Mexico.
07/wsj_0755:Santa Fe International Corp., which is owned by Kuwait (and isn't related to Santa Fe Southern Pacific's unit), is stepping up development of a well off Texas' Matagorda Island where it found gas in 1987. "We could have sat on it longer, but the impetus is to get the gas to the marketplace," says Richard Poole, senior scout for Santa Fe International. "We're trying to get it on line as soon as possible now." 
07/wsj_0755:This month, Exxon Corp. announced plans for a 400-day project drilling for gas about five miles underground in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma -- the deepest drilling project in the U.S. Exxon will use a Parker Drilling Co. rig built in 1981 that can go down 9 1/2 miles. 
07/wsj_0756:The proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika, Mikhail Gorbachev's restructuring of the economy.
07/wsj_0756:They lay out a clear timetable and methodology for liberalizing the system of setting prices, breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned companies out of business.
07/wsj_0756:They also address such taboo subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation, and recommend ways to soften the social consequences. 
07/wsj_0756:While many solutions to the nation's economic troubles are being discussed, the blueprint is attracting widespread attention here because of its comprehensiveness and presumed high-level authorship. 
07/wsj_0756:Although it was published unsigned in the latest edition of the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta, Soviet sources say the article was written by Leonid Abalkin and a small group of colleagues.
07/wsj_0756:Mr. Abalkin, head of the Academy of Science's Institute of Economics, was recently appointed deputy chairman of the Soviet government and head of a state commission on economic reform. 
07/wsj_0756:"It's clearly a manifesto for the next stage of perestroika," said one analyst. 
07/wsj_0756:For example, the proposed overhaul of prices -- an extremely sensitive political topic -- is far more precise than the vague plans announced by Mr. Gorbachev in 1987 and later dropped. 
07/wsj_0756:But the proposals also display political savvy, couching some of the most controversial ideas in cautious language so as not to alienate powerful conservatives in the government who stand to lose out if they are implemented.
07/wsj_0756:Seeking a middle path between opponents of change and radicals who demand overnight solutions, the article advocates what it calls a "radical-moderate approach." 
07/wsj_0756:The document is to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this month, and will probably be presented to the Soviet Parliament for consideration this year.
07/wsj_0756:The authors make a gloomy assessment of the economy and concede that "quick and easy paths to success simply don't exist." Instead, they map out a strategy in several phases from now until 1995.
07/wsj_0756:Most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on beleaguered Soviet consumers in two to three years at the earliest.
07/wsj_0756:The document proposes breaking up the monolithic system of state-owned enterprises and farms and allowing a big private sector to flourish, helped by tough anti-monopoly legislation.
07/wsj_0756:The economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and 1992, including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders, cooperatives and joint ventures.
07/wsj_0756:Some forms of private property would be sanctioned.
07/wsj_0756:Such moves would greatly reduce the power of government ministries, who now jealously guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform. 
07/wsj_0756:By the end of next year, all loss-making state enterprises would be put out of business or handed over to workers who would buy or lease them or turn them into cooperatives.
07/wsj_0756:Similar steps would be taken to liquidate unprofitable state and collective farms by the end of 1991.
07/wsj_0756:A unified system of taxation should be introduced rapidly.
07/wsj_0756:To mop up some of the 300 billion rubles in circulation, the government should encourage home ownership, including issuing bonds that guarantee holders the right to purchase an apartment. 
07/wsj_0756:Departing from decades of Soviet dogma, the new system would lead to big differences in pay between workers and almost certainly to unemployment.
07/wsj_0756:The entire system of centrally set prices would be overhauled, and free-market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade.
07/wsj_0756:Wholesale prices would be divided into three categories: raw materials sold at fixed prices close to world levels; government-set procurement prices for a small number of key products; and free prices for everything else to be determined by contracts between suppliers and purchasers.
07/wsj_0756:The current liberalization and decentralization of foreign trade would be taken much further.
07/wsj_0756:A domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the nation's banking system. 
07/wsj_0756:The blueprint is at its vaguest when referring to the fate of the two powerful economic institutions that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans: the State Planning Committee, known as Gosplan, and the State Committee for Material Supply, or Gossnab.
07/wsj_0756:But it hints strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes, particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies, take effect. 
07/wsj_0758:Mr. Engelken, a rabid baseball fan, pores over the sports pages to chart the exploits of "my favorite and not-so-favorite teams and players." He often groans, he says, at the "clutter" of sports stories about drugs, alcohol, gambling and some player's lament "about the miserly millions he is offered to play the game." His morning paper, the Washington Post, even carries a sports column called "Jurisprudence" that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers.
07/wsj_0758:But his is a story about a hero in an era of sports anti-heroes, and about what Babe Ruth, Mr. Engelken reminds us, once called "the only real game in the world." To Mr. Engelken, it is also a story "about love, because I'm blessed to have a wife who still thinks her slightly eccentric husband's 50th birthday deserves the ultimate present." 
07/wsj_0758:It was the ninth inning of the third game of a three-game playoff between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants (the predecessor to the San Francisco Giants scheduled to play in tonight's world series).
07/wsj_0758:Baseball fans throughout New York had sweated out a long summer with their teams, and now it had come to this: a battle between the two for the National League pennant -- down to the last inning of the last game, no less. 
07/wsj_0758:Some 34,320 fans jammed the stands, and shouted at the top of their lungs.
07/wsj_0758:Mr. Engelken was doing the same across the Hudson River in New Jersey, where, with his nose pressed against the front window of the Passaic-Clifton National Bank, he watched the duel on a television set the bank set up for the event. 
07/wsj_0758:The playoff series had riveted the 12-year-old Giants fan. "The Giants struck first, winning the opener, 3-1, on a two-run homer off Dodger right-hander Ralph Branca," Mr. Engelken recalls with precision today. "The Giants got swamped in the second game, 100, and trailed 4-1 going into the bottom of the ninth of the third and deciding game.
07/wsj_0758:The pitch sailed toward Bobby Thomson high and inside and then, with a crack of the bat, was sent rocketing back into the lower leftfield stands. "Giants fans went into euphoria," says Mr. Engelken. 
07/wsj_0758:Mr. Engelken moved south to Washington, but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of 1951.
07/wsj_0758:When his wife, Betsy, came down the aisle on their wedding day in 1966, Mr. Engelken -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment: "You look prettier than Bobby Thomson's home run." The couple's first dog, Homer, was named after the Great Event, though unwitting friends assumed he was the namesake of the poet. 
07/wsj_0758:And when Mr. Engelken's sister, Martha, who was born two days before the home run, reached her 25th birthday, Mr. Engelken wrote his sports hero to tell him of the coincidence of events.
07/wsj_0758:The family license plate reads "ENG 23," the first three letters of the family name and -- no surprise here -- Bobby Thomson's uniform number.
07/wsj_0758:On her husband's 50th birthday (after an auspicious 23 years of marriage, it should be noted), Betsy, Al and their college-bound son set out for New York to visit Fordham University.
07/wsj_0758:The papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone booths just off Exit 10. 
07/wsj_0758:"It sounded like something out of Ian Fleming," Mr. Engelken recalls. 
07/wsj_0758:In a matter of minutes, she was back, with a tall, silver-haired man in tow.
07/wsj_0758:"And there he was," recalls Mr. Engelken. "The hero of my youth, the one person in history I'd most like to meet.
07/wsj_0758:They talked of the home run. "I thought it was in the upper deck," said Bobby Thomson, now 66 years old.
07/wsj_0758:They talked of the aftermath. "I never thought it would become so momentous," Bobby remarked.
07/wsj_0758:The two men spent an hour at Exit 10, rehashing the event, "fulfilling the lifelong dream of a young boy now turned 50," Mr. Engelken says.
07/wsj_0758:His hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called Ralph Branca "a very fine pitcher." And when Mr. Engelken asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he didn't even know, Bobby Thomson replied: "You know, Albert, if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy, you have an obligation to do it." 
07/wsj_0758:My mind was miles north at a place called Coogan's Bluff, where a real sports hero had captured the imagination of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it. 
07/wsj_0758:You might meet up with him at that bank of telephone booths just off Exit 10 of the New Jersey Turnpike." 
07/wsj_0759:Southam Inc. said its unprofitable weekly newspaper, The Financial Times of Canada, is up for sale. 
07/wsj_0759:Analysts said the announcement, the latest in a series of divestitures and restructuring moves, is aimed at improving Southam's earnings before the expiration in June of a standstill pact with Torstar Corp. 
07/wsj_0759:Descendants of the Southam family hold an additional 22.6% stake in the Toronto-based company, Canada's largest newspaper publisher. 
07/wsj_0759:A spokesman for Southam declined to comment on the price the company is seeking or on estimates of the paper's annual losses, which most analysts place at between C$4 million and C$7 million. 
07/wsj_0759:Yesterday, Southam reported third-quarter earnings of C$10.8 million on revenue of C$395.4 million, down from C$14.6 million on revenue of C$389.6 million in the year-ago quarter. 
07/wsj_0759:Southam said the level of future investment required by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas. 
07/wsj_0759:The acquisition of the Financial Times of Canada is "well within reach for any number of media companies, both public and private," said James Cole, an analyst with Toronto-based BBN James Capel Inc. 
07/wsj_0759:Possible bidders include Christopher Ondaatje, a Toronto financier and vice chairman of Hees International Bancorp Inc., a holding company controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family.
07/wsj_0759:Mr. Ondaatje couldn't be reached for comment, but Roy Mac-Laren, chairman of CB Media, a closely held concern that publishes two business magazines, said his company would take a close look at the newspaper. 
07/wsj_0759:Mr. Cole said the sale of the 77-year Financial Times, which Southam has owned since 1961, is consistent with Southam's strategy of cutting costs to obtain maximum profits from its operations while disposing of "chronically under-performing" assets. 
07/wsj_0759:The Financial Times of Canada has no links to the British daily newspaper, The Financial Times. 
07/wsj_0760:The company had a tax credit of $1.4 million.
07/wsj_0760:However, the company's petroleum services segment, while profitable, was hurt by high financing costs associated with the company's buy-out of a 50% stake in Eastman Christensen Co. from Texas Eastern Corp. last June.
07/wsj_0760:Norton announced earlier this month that it was exploring the possible sale of all or part of Eastman Christensen. 
07/wsj_0760:For the nine months, Norton had net of $81.2 million, or $3.87 a share, and a tax credit of $4.4 million.
07/wsj_0760:In the year-earlier period, the company had net of $77.2 million, or $3.68 a share, and a tax credit of $7.7 million. 
07/wsj_0760:Norton had operating profit of $76.8 million, or $3.66 a share, up 11% from $69.5 million, or $3.31 a share. 
07/wsj_0761:Now the 33-year-old housewife, whose husband earns a modest salary as an assistant professor of economics, is saving harder than ever. "I am determined to get an apartment in three years," she says. "It's all I think about or talk about." 
07/wsj_0761:For the Parks and millions of other young Koreans, the long-cherished dream of home ownership has become a cruel illusion.
07/wsj_0761:Last May, a government panel released a report on the extent and causes of the problem.
07/wsj_0761:For those with no holdings, the prospects of buying a home are ever slimmer. 
07/wsj_0761:In 1987, a quarter of the population owned 91% of the nation's 71,895 square kilometers of private land, the report said, and 10% of the population owned 65% of the land devoted to housing.
07/wsj_0761:Meanwhile, the government's Land Bureau reports that only about a third of Korean families own their own homes. 
07/wsj_0761:Former National Assemblyman Hong Sa-Duk, now a radio commentator, says the problem is intolerable for many people. "I'm afraid of a popular revolt if this situation isn't corrected," he adds.
07/wsj_0761:The proposed legislation is aimed at rectifying some of the inequities in the current land-ownership system.
07/wsj_0761:Highlights of the bills, as currently framed, are: 
07/wsj_0761:-- A restriction on the amount of real estate one family can own, to 660 square meters in the nation's six largest cities, but more in smaller cities and rural areas.
07/wsj_0761:-- A tax of between 3% and 6% on property holdings that exceed the governmentset ceiling. 
07/wsj_0761:-- Taxes of between 15% and 50% a year on "excessive" profits from the resale of property, or the sale of idle land to the government.
07/wsj_0761:-- Grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect. 
07/wsj_0761:The administration says the measures would stem rampant property speculation, free more land for the government's ambitious housing-construction program, designed to build two million apartments by 1992 -- and, perhaps, boost the popular standing of President Roh. 
07/wsj_0761:The Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice, a public-interest group leading the charge for radical reform, wants restrictions on landholdings, high taxation of capital gains, and drastic revamping of the value-assessment system on which property taxes are based. 
07/wsj_0761:Led by the Federation of Korean Industries, the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties. 
07/wsj_0761:Government officials who are urging real-estate reforms balk at the arguments of business leaders and chafe at their pressure. "There is no violation of the capitalistic principle of private property in what we are doing," says Lee Kyu Hwang, director of the government's Land Bureau, which drafted the bills.
07/wsj_0761:But, he adds, the constitution empowers the government to impose some controls, to mitigate the shortage of land. 
07/wsj_0761:The land available for housing construction stands at about 46.2 square meters a person -- 18% lower than in Taiwan and only about half that of Japan. 
07/wsj_0761:The chief culprits, he says, are big companies and business groups that buy huge amounts of land "not for their corporate use, but for resale at huge profit." 
07/wsj_0761:One research institute calculated that as much as 67% of corporate-owned land is held by 403 companies -- and that as little as 1.5% of that is used for business.
07/wsj_0761:The government's Office of Bank Supervision and Examination told the National Assembly this month that in the first half of 1989, the nation's 30 largest business groups bought real estate valued at $1.5 billion. 
07/wsj_0761:The Ministry of Finance, as a result, has proposed a series of measures that would restrict business investment in real estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed at individuals. 
07/wsj_0761:Banks, investment and credit firms would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to 50% of their capital -- currently the proportion is 75%.
07/wsj_0761:The maximum allowable property holdings for insurance companies would be reduced to 10% of their total asset value, down from 15% currently. 
07/wsj_0762:CAMBREX Corp., Bayonne, N.J., declared its initial quarterly of five cents a share, payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10.
07/wsj_0762:The maker of specialty chemicals has about 5.9 million shares outstanding.
07/wsj_0762:Although profits were "squeezed" in 1989, mainly as a result of higher raw-material costs, the company said it is confident about future earnings and cash flow for 1990 and beyond.
07/wsj_0763:Under those amendments, which took effect in March of this year, the federal government can intervene in private housing-discrimination lawsuits. 
07/wsj_0763:The ordinance, in Moon Township, prohibits locating a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility.
07/wsj_0763:In papers filed with the federal district court in Pittsburgh, the Justice Department alleged that the ordinance, by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township, makes housing unavailable on account of handicap.
07/wsj_0763:Greg Smith, Moon Township manager, said the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the mentally retarded from changing "the character and flavor of the neighborhood." He said the ordinance also will benefit the mentally retarded. "Our intent is to spread them out" to insure they are well integrated into the community, he said. 
07/wsj_0764:Energetic and concrete action has been taken in Colombia during the past 60 days against the mafiosi of the drug trade, but it has not been sufficiently effective, because, unfortunately, it came too late. 
07/wsj_0764:Ten years ago, the newspaper El Espectador, of which my brother Guillermo was editor, began warning of the rise of the drug mafias and of their leaders' aspirations to control Colombian politics, especially the Congress.
07/wsj_0764:Within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the El Espectador in Bogota, destroying a major part of its installations and equipment.
07/wsj_0764:And only last week the newspaper Vanguardia Liberal in the city of Bucaramanga was bombed, and its installations destroyed.
07/wsj_0764:The solidarity of the uncensored media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way press freedom can survive. 
07/wsj_0764:The American people and their government also woke up too late to the menace drugs posed to the moral structure of their country.
07/wsj_0764:Even now, the American attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat.
07/wsj_0764:All drug-consuming countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs.
07/wsj_0764:Reduction, if not the total cessation, of drug consumption is the requirement for victory. 
07/wsj_0764:More than 300 planes and helicopters have been impounded at airports, and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated.
07/wsj_0764:The military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons, explosives and other war-like materiel.
07/wsj_0764:Much has been accomplished and public opinion decisively supports the government and the army -- but, on the other hand, none of the key drug barons have been captured. 
07/wsj_0764:There has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the Colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money.
07/wsj_0764:Laundered drug money has served only to increase, unrealistically, the price of real estate, creating serious problems for low-income people who aspire to own their own homes.
07/wsj_0764:But most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside Colombia.
07/wsj_0764:In fact, the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle. 
07/wsj_0764:What is of much more importance to the Colombian economy than the supposed benefits of laundered drug money is higher prices for Colombia's legitimate products.
07/wsj_0764:The price of coffee has gone down almost 45% since the beginning of the year, to the lowest level (after inflation) since the Great Depression.
07/wsj_0764:U.S. interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important Colombian export -- cut flowers -- into the American market.
07/wsj_0764:A just price and an open market for what Colombian produces and exports should be the policy of the U.S. 
07/wsj_0764:I take advantage of this opportunity given to me by The Wall Street Journal to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper, to become soldiers dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs.
07/wsj_0764:Each gram of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible scourge.
07/wsj_0764:A crusade of NO to the consumption of drugs is imperative. 
07/wsj_0764:Mr. Cano is president of El Espectador, a newspaper founded by his grandfather. 
07/wsj_0765:Thirty-four thousand of its children live in foster homes, while 50,000 residents have no homes at all.
07/wsj_0765:When the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race, the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named David Dinkins.
07/wsj_0765:Asked about his greatest achievement in public life, he first speaks about the quality of his staff. 
07/wsj_0765:Will he, if he wins, be in the thrall of the most liberal of his allies, who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings, or will he tilt toward the real-estate interests that have funneled money into his campaign? 
07/wsj_0765:After his decisive primary victory over Mayor Edward I. Koch in September, Mr. Dinkins coasted, until recently, on a quite-comfortable lead over his Republican opponent, Rudolph Giuliani, the former crime buster who has proved a something of a bust as a candidate. 
07/wsj_0765:But Mr. Dinkins has stumbled in the past two weeks over his campaign's payments to a black activist who is a convicted kidnapper, and over his handling of a stock sale to his son.
07/wsj_0765:In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty. "A lot of people think I will give away the store, but I can assure you I will not," he says. "I am aware we have real budgetary problems." 
07/wsj_0765:The city is full of aging bridges, water mains and roadways that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair.
07/wsj_0765:And after a decade of explosive job growth on Wall Street, a period of contraction is under way. 
07/wsj_0765:By and large, Mr. Dinkins has finessed the touchy question of whose ox he would gore.
07/wsj_0765:Instead of focusing on the financial future, Mr. Dinkins has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated by Mayor Koch. "The thing about the Dinkins candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people," says Meyer Frucher, a real-estate executive and former aide to Gov. Mario Cuomo. "It is a feel-good candidacy." 
07/wsj_0765:He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues' children, opens doors for women, and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody.
07/wsj_0765:More important, he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger -- in which a group of Harlem teens was charged -- and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst.
07/wsj_0765:Rather than scaring off white voters, as many predicted he would, Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head. (Keeping cool is a Dinkins priority: On humid days this summer, he was known to change his double-breasted suits as many as four times a day.) 
07/wsj_0765:But even in his front-runner campaign, he has shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as Manhattan borough president -- and might hinder him as mayor.
07/wsj_0765:Over the last few weeks, he has frittered away roughly half of what was once a 33-point lead in the polls over Mr. Giuliani.
07/wsj_0765:A story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political patron Percy Sutton was allowed to fester a full week before Mr. Dinkins faced the media.
07/wsj_0765:But his chance to become deputy mayor under Mayor Abraham Beame, a plan boosted by Mr. Sutton, was squandered because of Mr. Dinkins's failure -- still largely unexplained -- to file income tax returns for four years running. "I always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow," he said at the time. 
07/wsj_0765:O'Dwyer is now one of the lawyers for Mr. Sutton's media company.) 
07/wsj_0765:David Garth, Mayor Koch's longtime media adviser, says of Mr. Dinkins, "He really is the personification of the patronage system.
07/wsj_0765:But by most accounts, he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city's Board of Estimate, the body that votes on crucial budget and land-use matters.
07/wsj_0765:Colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours as Mr. Dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss, en masse, certain controversial proposals. "He taught me how to drink herbal tea instead of coffee at 3 a.m., I'll give him that," says Deputy Mayor Robert Esnard. 
07/wsj_0765:On the campaign stump, he often points out that he was the only Board of Estimate member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at Manhattan's Columbus Circle.
07/wsj_0765:One Board member, Bronx Borough President Ferdinand Ferrer, was said to be so impatient with Mr. Dinkins's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for Mr. Dinkins's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign. "I had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind," Mr. Ferrer admits, but he maintains that he didn't delay his support of Mr. Dinkins and that he backs the Democratic candidate enthusiastically. 
07/wsj_0765:Mr. Dinkins's campaign manager and former chief of staff, Bill Lynch, denies that the Manhattan borough president has taken too long to decide important issues. "We didn't rubber-stamp everything that came to us," Mr. Lynch says. 
07/wsj_0765:On some occasions when Mr. Dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign, he has run into a familiar kind of trouble.
07/wsj_0765:Then, two days before receiving an endorsement from environmental groups, Mr. Dinkins promised he would issue a three-year moratorium on construction of garbage-incinerator plants.
07/wsj_0765:He favors a form of commercial rent control, which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city.
07/wsj_0765:In the midst of a labor shortage, he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring New York City residents.
07/wsj_0765:And he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of New Jersey and Connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of New York City.
07/wsj_0765:Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry organization, says Mr. Dinkins's "economic development program is shortsighted, but when it comes down to it, he can be reasonable." 
07/wsj_0765:Mr. Dinkins's inner circle of advisers appears to include both ideologues and pragmatists, leaving voters with little clue as to who will be more influential.
07/wsj_0765:A disheveled, roly-poly son of a Long Island potato farmer, Mr. Lynch is a veteran union organizer who worked on the presidential campaigns of Sen. Edward Kennedy and Mr. Jackson.
07/wsj_0765:But as the Dinkins campaign hit tough times this month, Andrew Cuomo, the politically seasoned son of the New York governor, is also said to have taken a more active role on strategy. 
07/wsj_0765:Another close ally is Ruth Messinger, a Manhattan city councilwoman, some of whose programs, such as commercial rent control, have made their way into Mr. Dinkins's position papers.
07/wsj_0765:Some business leaders and others also believe that Mr. Dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background.
07/wsj_0765:Names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate Richard Ravitch, former schools chancellor Frank Macchiarola and Messrs.
07/wsj_0765:Having attained positions of real influence or wealth, these men constitute the Old Guard of New York City black politics; they are less confrontational than the younger, more activist black political community that has been based largely in Brooklyn. (Part of Mr. Dinkins's strength is his ability to win the support of both the Brooklyn and Harlem factions.) 
07/wsj_0765:"We know there are potholes for the city out there," says Mr. Paterson, Mr. Dinkins's former law partner. "If any of us think we're going to sidetrack David's determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us, we are making a sad mistake." Adds Ms. Messinger, who is expected to win the borough president's job Mr. Dinkins is vacating, "You have to remember David is a pragmatist." 
07/wsj_0765:But Mr. Dinkins's sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an insider's determination not to upset the political apple cart.
07/wsj_0765:He is taken aback in an interview when asked whether, as mayor, he plans on reforming the political "fiefdoms" that perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of New York's school system. "I will sit down and talk some of the problems out, but take on the political system?
07/wsj_0765:Uh-uh," he says with a shake of the head. 
07/wsj_0765:Despite many doubts about his candidacy, white New Yorkers -- who gave Mr. Dinkins 30% of their votes in the primary -- aren't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to Mr. Giuliani.
07/wsj_0765:As a first-time candidate, he has been slow to learn the nuances of New York City politicking. 
07/wsj_0766:Toni Johnson pulls a tape measure across the front of what was once a stately Victorian home. 
07/wsj_0766:The chimney is a pile of bricks on the front lawn.
07/wsj_0766:The remainder of the house leans precariously against a sturdy oak tree. 
07/wsj_0766:She has been on the move almost incessantly since last Thursday, when an army of adjusters, employed by major insurers, invaded the San Francisco area to help policyholders sift through the rubble and restore some order to their lives. 
07/wsj_0766:Equipped with cellular telephones, laptop computers, calculators and a pack of blank checks, they parcel out money so their clients can find temporary living quarters, buy food, replace lost clothing, repair broken water heaters, and replaster walls.
07/wsj_0766:Some of the funds will used to demolish unstable buildings and clear sites for future construction. 
07/wsj_0766:She snaps photos of the buckled floors and the plaster that has fallen away from the walls. 
07/wsj_0766:One of the friends sweeps broken dishes and shattered glass from a countertop and starts to pack what can be salvaged from the kitchen.
07/wsj_0766:Only about 20% of California home and business owners carried earthquake coverage.
07/wsj_0766:Ms. Johnson, who works out of Aetna's office in Walnut Creek, an East Bay suburb, is awed by the earthquake's destructive force. "It really brings you down to a human level," she says. "It's hard to accept all the suffering people are going through, but you have to.
07/wsj_0766:Aetna, which has nearly 3,000 adjusters, had deployed about 750 of them in Charlotte, Columbia, and Charleston.
07/wsj_0766:Because of the difficulty of assessing the damages caused by the earthquake, Aetna pulled together a team of its most experienced claims adjusters from around the country.
07/wsj_0766:Some adjusters, like Alan Singer of San Diego, had been working in Charleston for nearly four weeks.
07/wsj_0766:Adjusters must count the number of bathrooms, balconies, fireplaces, chimneys, microwaves and dishwashers.
07/wsj_0766:But they must also assign a price to each of these items as well as to floors, wallcoverings, roofing and siding, to come up with a total value for a house.
07/wsj_0766:To do that, they must think in terms of sheetrock by the square foot, carpeting by the square yard, wallpaper by the roll, molding by the linear foot.
07/wsj_0766:Using a calculator and a unit-price guide for such jobs as painting, plumbing and roofing in each major region of the country, adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today's market and what it would cost to rebuild it. 
07/wsj_0766:Sometimes repairs are out of the question.
07/wsj_0766:When Aetna adjuster Bill Schaeffer visited a retired couple in Oakland last Thursday, he found them living in a mobile home parked in front of their yard. 
07/wsj_0766:The house itself, located about 50 yards from the collapsed section of double-decker highway Interstate 880, was pushed about four feet off its foundation and then collapsed into its basement. 
07/wsj_0766:Many of the adjusters employed by Aetna and other insurers have some experience with construction work or carpentry.
07/wsj_0766:She signed up, starting as an "inside" adjuster, who settles minor claims and does a lot of work by phone.
07/wsj_0766:Her new line of work has some perils.
07/wsj_0766:Recently, a contractor saved her from falling three stories as she investigated what remained of an old Victorian house torched by an arsonist. "I owe that contractor.
07/wsj_0766:It is an aftershock, one of about 2,000 since the earthquake, and it makes her uneasy. 
07/wsj_0766:The next day, as she prepares a $10,000 check for the Hammacks, which will cover the cost of demolishing the house and clearing away the debris, she jumps at the slightest noise.
07/wsj_0766:Earthquake insurance costs about $2 to $4 annually for every $1,000 of value, and high deductibles mean it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe.
07/wsj_0766:Now she says she's thinking of contacting her own insurance agent. 
07/wsj_0766:Last Sunday, Ms. Johnson finally got a chance to water her plants, but stopped abruptly. "I realized I couldn't waste this water when there are people in Watsonville who don't have fresh water to drink." She hasn't played any music since the earthquake hit, out of respect for those who died on Interstate 880 where the roadway collapsed. 
07/wsj_0767:The Federal Communications Commission allowed American Telephone & Telegraph Co. to continue offering discount phone services for large-business customers and said it would soon re-examine its regulation of the long-distance market. 
07/wsj_0767:The FCC moves were good news for AT&T, which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation.
07/wsj_0767:Alfred Sikes, the new FCC chairman, championed deregulation of AT&T at his last job as head of a Commerce Department telecommunications agency.
07/wsj_0767:But it has been an open question whether Mr. Sikes, an extraordinarily cautious man, would continue pushing deregulation at the FCC in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure. 
07/wsj_0767:"It means that Sikes is serious about the deregulation of long distance," said Jack Grubman, a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc., who attended the FCC meeting. "All the commissioners were in amazing agreement {to re-examine regulation} for only having been together for a few months." 
07/wsj_0767:Indeed, Joe Nacchio, AT&T's vice president for business-communications services, said AT&T offered a similar Tariff 15 discount to Resort Condominium International, of Indianapolis, to meet another MCI bid.
07/wsj_0767:Richard Firestone, chief of the FCC's common-carrier bureau, said he expected the agency to propose new rules next year. 
07/wsj_0767:But MCI, of Washington, was displeased with the FCC decision concerning Tariff 12, arguing that "AT&T cannot be allowed to flaunt FCC rules." 
07/wsj_0767:Separately, AT&T filed a countersuit against MCI accusing it of misleading consumers through allegedly "false and deceptive" advertising.
07/wsj_0767:AT&T assembled three of its top executives in Washington, all visibly angry, to try to refute MCI's charges. "MCI has made hawks out of the upper echelon of AT&T," said PaineWebber's Mr. Grubman, who said he expected AT&T to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime nemesis. 
07/wsj_0768:Billions of investors' dollars are pouring out of the nation's junk-bond mutual funds, undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market. 
07/wsj_0768:Last week alone, an eye-popping $1.6 billion flowed out of the junk funds, or nearly 5% of their total assets, according to estimates by Dalbar Financial Services Inc., a Boston research firm. 
07/wsj_0768:In the past two months the nation's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $6 billion -- more than 15% of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares, Dalbar says.
07/wsj_0768:Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $500 million, or about 13% of their junk fund assets, in the past two months. 
07/wsj_0768:Some fund managers say negative publicity has exacerbated investors' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices. "People have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying: `I can't take it anymore -- I'm getting out, '" says Kurt Brouwer of Brouwer & Janachowski, a San Francisco investment adviser. 
07/wsj_0768:If the heavy outflows continue, fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay departing investors in the weeks ahead.
07/wsj_0768:Such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds, already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems. 
07/wsj_0768:Mutual fund groups haven't lost control of much of the outgoing money, says Louis Harvey, Dalbar's president.
07/wsj_0768:Mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts, and to a lesser extent, government-bond funds.
07/wsj_0768:But tremors are likely in the junk-bond market, which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years.
07/wsj_0768:Mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk, accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high-yield, high-risk market.
07/wsj_0768:The 88 mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $32 billion.
07/wsj_0768:Other funds hold a smattering of junk bonds, too. 
07/wsj_0768:The $1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow of about $150 million in the past two months.
07/wsj_0768:About $60 million streamed out last week alone, double the level of the week following last month's Campeau Corp. credit squeeze.
07/wsj_0768:About 98% of the outflow was transferred to other Fidelity funds, says Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president, marketing, with most going into money market funds. 
07/wsj_0768:The fund, with a cash cushion of more than 10%, has "met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing," Mr. Litvack says.
07/wsj_0768:Vanguard's $1 billion High Yield Bond Portfolio has seen $161 million flow out since early September; $14 million of that seeped out Friday Oct. 13 alone.
07/wsj_0768:Still, two-thirds of the outflow has been steered into other Vanguard portfolios, says Brian Mattes, a vice president.
07/wsj_0768:The fund now holds a cash position of about 15%. 
07/wsj_0768:Those withdrawals, most of which were transferred to other T. Rowe Price funds, followed little change in the fund's sales picture this year through August. "The last two months have been the whole ball game," says Steven Norwitz, a vice president. 
07/wsj_0768:Through Oct. 19, high-yield funds had an average 0.85% total return (the price change plus dividends on fund shares), according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. That's even less than the 4.35% total return of the Merrill Lynch High-Yield Index. 
07/wsj_0768:Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers.
07/wsj_0768:And then, asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far. 
07/wsj_0768:Says Michael Hirsch, chief investment officer of Republic National Bank and manager of the FundTrust Group in New York: "It's a time bomb just waiting to go off." 
07/wsj_0769:The surprise resignation yesterday of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the British economy. 
07/wsj_0769:The U.S. unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling's tumble, as market participants switched out of pounds. 
07/wsj_0769:Mr. Lawson's resignation shocked many analysts, despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
07/wsj_0769:Graham Beale, manager of foreign-exchange operations at Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corp. in New York, added that Mrs. Thatcher's comments reinforced the market's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit's later decline. 
07/wsj_0769:In Tokyo Friday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 142.02 yen, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 141.90 yen. 
07/wsj_0769:Mr. Foley of Lloyds noted that Mr. Lawson's replacement, John Major, the British foreign minister, will take time to establish his credibility and, in the meantime, sterling could trend downward in volatile trade. 
07/wsj_0769:But Mr. Foley predicted few economic policy changes ahead, commenting that Mr. Major shares "a very similar view of the world" with Mr. Lawson. 
07/wsj_0769:Bob Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York, also noted that the pound's sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered United Kingdom economic policies. 
07/wsj_0769:Meanwhile, dollar trading was relatively uninspired throughout the session, according to dealers, who noted that Thursday's release of the preliminary report on the U.S. third-quarter gross national product was something of a nonevent. 
07/wsj_0769:U.S. GNP rose at an annual rate of 2.5% in the third quarter.
07/wsj_0769:The implicit price deflator, a measure of inflation, was down to a 2.9% annual rate of increase in the quarter from a 4.6% rate of gain in the second quarter. 
07/wsj_0770:Anheuser-Busch Cos., shelf offering of $575 million of debt securities. 
07/wsj_0770:Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, shelf offering of $200 million of debt securities, via Salomon Brothers Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. 
07/wsj_0770:First Brands Corp., proposed offering of 6,475,000 common shares, of which 1,475,000 common shares will be sold by the company and five million shares by holders, via First Boston Corp. and Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. 
07/wsj_0770:Home Nutritional Services Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Healthdyne Inc., proposed initial offering of four million common shares, of which 1.8 million will be sold by Home Nutritional Services and 2.2 million will be sold by Healthdyne, via Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. 
07/wsj_0770:Parametric Technology Corp., initial public offering of 1.7 million common shares, of which 1,365,226 will be offered by the company and 334,774 will be offered by holders, via Alex.
07/wsj_0770:SynOptics Communications Inc., proposed public offering of 1.5 million common shares, of which 1,003,884 shares are to be sold by the company and 496,116 shares are to be sold by holders, via Morgan Stanley & Co. and Hambrecht & Quist. 
07/wsj_0771:On an office wall of the Senate intelligence committee hangs a quote from Chairman David Boren, "Don't hold your ticket 'til the show's over." He once used that line in a closed-door meeting on Panama, meaning don't shrink from taking action against Manuel Noriega. 
07/wsj_0771:So how did a good senator like this end up approving a policy that required the U.S. to warn Mr. Noriega of any coup plot against him? "I agree, it's ridiculous," says Mr. Boren, and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way to describe how the U.S. decides to take -- or rather, not to take -- covert action. 
07/wsj_0771:George Bush disclosed the policy last week by reading it to GOP senators, perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the Panama fiasco to Congress.
07/wsj_0771:The policy was contained in an exchange of letters last October between the Senate intelligence committee and the CIA and National Security Council.
07/wsj_0771:It's ironic that David Boren should be in the center of this mire.
07/wsj_0771:A former Oklahoma governor, he's a thoughtful defender of presidential powers in foreign policy.
07/wsj_0771:He's the senator most like Arthur Vandenberg, the GOP senator from Michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s. "Vandenberg and Rayburn are heroes of mine," Mr. Boren says, referring as well to Sam Rayburn, the Democratic House speaker who cooperated with President Eisenhower. "They allowed this country to be credible.
07/wsj_0771:Mr. Boren doesn't think all this influenced the failed coup this month, but he does concede that Congress has made mistakes. "In the aftermath of Vietnam, in the aftermath of Iran-Contra, I can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup, they have to bring their lawyers," he says. 
07/wsj_0771:So what does consensus mean? "It doesn't mean unanimous," he insists, though he implies it means a bipartisan majority. "The sustainability of U.S. foreign policy is essential," he explains. "Why was containment so successful?
07/wsj_0771:Elliott Abrams, a veteran of intelligence committee debates, doubts that even Grenada or the Libyan raid would have taken place if "consensus" had been required.
07/wsj_0771:He points to a letter on his desk, his second in a week from President Bush, saying that they "don't disagree." More broadly, Mr. Boren hopes that Panama will shock Washington out of its fear of using military power. "Maybe this will jolt us out of the post-Vietnam syndrome that we never are prepared to use force," he says. 
07/wsj_0771:Maybe -- if every senator shared the principles of Mr. Boren.
07/wsj_0771:But it's just as plausible to argue that if even David Boren can get mired in this sort of mess, the problem goes beyond legal interpretation.
07/wsj_0771:Maybe the problem is a political system that won't act without an "exchange of letters," that insists on running foreign policy by committee, that treats a president as just another guy at the table. 
07/wsj_0771:The reply of the Metzenbaums and Cohens is that we can't abolish these oversight committees because we've seen too many abuses of executive power.
07/wsj_0771:The lawyers are now in charge of our national security.
07/wsj_0772:I was impressed by the perceptiveness of your Sept. 12 story "Rural Enterprise: Tough Row To Hoe." 
07/wsj_0772:This morning as I drove the 13 miles to my law office and endured the routine heavy traffic during that twice-daily journey, I thought of how fortunate it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening. 
07/wsj_0772:The presence of so many people, cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want to live. 
07/wsj_0772:I remembered how hard it was for an outsider to become accepted by long-established, stake-holding residents, and what pitfalls awaited an original thinker in societies that were long accustomed to unchanging, "safe" ways of thought and action. 
07/wsj_0772:Now, I revel in the freedom, culture, activity and diversity of this great metropolitan area with its traffic jams and perpetual road-building projects. 
07/wsj_0772:Yet when my youngest child died two years ago, I buried him in the church cemetery of a small Missouri town. 
07/wsj_0772:So after all, even the bitterest critic of rural exclusivity harbors a continuing yearning for those scarce, rural virtues thought to exist amid fields, forests and country lanes. 
07/wsj_0773:Finnish government officials are negotiating with creditors of Waertsilae Marine Oy, a major shipyard that filed for bankruptcy protection this week, amid confusion and mounting doubts that collapse of the nation's entire shipbuilding industry can be averted. 
07/wsj_0773:At stake are almost 10,000 jobs in an industry that has been the mainstay of Finland's post-war economic revival.
07/wsj_0773:Shipbuilding became a point of pride as Finnish shipyards remained profitable long after rivals collapsed all over Europe. 
07/wsj_0773:But if, as many now fear, Waertsilae Marine joins the ranks of failed shipyards it might turn out to be remembered most as a blemish on Finland's international reputation.
07/wsj_0773:Miami-based Carnival said the first of the three ships is scheduled to be delivered next month, just in time for the winter tourist season in the Caribbean.
07/wsj_0773:Bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments, shippers will counter with a hail of lawsuits. 
07/wsj_0773:State loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy.
07/wsj_0773:However, some bankers cited possible parallels between the Waertsilae Marine case and the collapse of Norway's state-owned Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk AS two years ago.
07/wsj_0773:Doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of Finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders, analysts warn.
07/wsj_0773:The decision by a majority of state-appointed Waertsilae Marine directors Monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt about-face from previous government policy.
07/wsj_0773:In August, the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard. 
07/wsj_0773:At the time 71%-controlled by Oy Waertsilae, a conglomerate, the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion markka and was on the brink of liquidation.
07/wsj_0773:Under the rescue plan, Waertsilae sold 51% of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds.
07/wsj_0773:The government, in turn, guaranteed financing to complete the order backlog and took control of the board. 
07/wsj_0773:The government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was thwarted when the parent Waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute. 
07/wsj_0773:After the restructuring of Waertsilae Marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees, two big bank creditors, Union Bank of Finland and state-controlled Postipankki, resumed lending the shipyard working capital.
07/wsj_0773:Noting that Sweden wound up wasting state subsidies of about 35 billion Swedish kronor ($5.47 billion) during the 1970s in a vain attempt to salvage its shipbuilding industry, one analyst suggested that Mr. Suominen may have decided to cut Finland's losses once and for all. 
07/wsj_0773:Senior ministry officials huddled with creditors during the week in an attempt to agree on some form of restructuring that would keep Waertsilae Marine operating.
07/wsj_0774:Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it expects to report an extraordinary loss of about $122 million in the fourth quarter due to early retirement of debt. 
07/wsj_0774:The cable programmer said the loss will consist primarily of prepayment penalties, and unamortized issue discount and costs related to its just-completed $1.6 billion refinancing of its long-term debt and some preferred stock in one of its subsidiaries. 
07/wsj_0774:A Turner spokesman wouldn't speculate on the extent of the charge's effect on the quarter's earnings, but said the company continues to expect to report a net loss for 1989. 
07/wsj_0774:The company said the repayment or redemption of the long-term debt, and the outstanding Class A cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of Cable News Network, was made possible by an offering of about $750 million of debentures and notes and $900 million in bank borrowings. 
07/wsj_0774:The offering included $550 million of 12% senior subordinated debentures due 2001 and $200 million of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due 2004.
07/wsj_0774:In addition, the company called its 12 7/8% senior subordinated notes due 1994, with an aggregate principal amount of $200 million, for redemption on Dec. 15. 
07/wsj_0774:As a result of the refinancing, the company said the interest on the debt will fall to slightly more than 11% from slightly more than 14%. 
07/wsj_0775:General Motors Corp. said it will temporarily idle its Arlington, Texas, assembly plant for one week beginning Monday because of slow sales. 
07/wsj_0775:The closing will affect about 3,000 workers and eliminate production of 700 cars.
07/wsj_0775:The No. 1 auto maker scheduled overtime this week at its Janesville, Wis., assembly plant, manufacturer of the Chevrolet Cavalier. 
07/wsj_0776:The surprise resignations of two top economic government officials heaped more uncertainty on London's financial markets, which already have been laboring under worries about Britain's ailing economy. 
07/wsj_0776:"The last thing markets like is uncertainty," said Ian Harwood, chief economist at S.G. Warburg & Co., of the resignations of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and chief economic adviser Sir Alan Walters. "I think you'll see share prices go down, and sterling now is under something of a cloud." 
07/wsj_0776:The British economy is hardly the picture of health these days.
07/wsj_0776:Unions are pressing demands for wage increases of more than 10% despite general belief that economic growth next year will be less than 2%. 
07/wsj_0776:The Financial Times 100-share index has dropped about 12% from its 1989 high of 2423.9 on Sept. 8.
07/wsj_0776:It's quite likely we're going to get repeats" of the mid-October market shocks. 
07/wsj_0776:Red ink already has begun to flow in the wake of the U.S.-U.K. market breaks of Oct. 13 and Oct. 16.
07/wsj_0776:London-based LIT Holdings, the largest financer of traders in the Chicago options and futures markets, said yesterday it will incur a second-half loss as a result of the market plunge.
07/wsj_0776:But company insiders estimated that the loss could approach the equivalent of $10 million. 
07/wsj_0776:Christopher Castleman, LIT chief executive, said in an interview that the loss stemmed from the default of three options traders who had bet on a price rise in UAL Corp. shares before Oct. 13.
07/wsj_0776:The price plummeted after a proposed leveraged buy-out of the airline fell through. 
07/wsj_0776:Denizens of London's financial district are cushioning themselves for heavy blows. "A lot more of our customers are staying until our 10 p.m. closing time," says Christopher Brown, managing director of Corney & Barrow Restaurants Ltd., which runs five tony wine bars in the district. 
07/wsj_0776:The malaise has created a nostalgic longing for the uncomplicated days of the mid-1980s, before a rash of securities-firm mergers on the eve of the industry's deregulation in 1986. "People come to us saying they'd like to be back where they were a few years ago, in a more collegial atmosphere, with less tension," says Stephen Waterhouse, managing director of Hanover Partners Ltd., a financial district head-hunting firm. 
07/wsj_0776:The industry, which currently employs about 25,000 people in London, has shed about 2,500 jobs over the past two years. "I can see cuts of at least 20% more," says the head of the London office of a major U.S. firm. 
07/wsj_0776:"If prices in the States go down, industrial buyers in Europe have the opportunity of getting reasonable prices in the U.S.," says Francois von Hurter, chief of Continential M&A at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd.
07/wsj_0776:At the others, there are going to be a lot of disappointments, after all those promises and all that big money that's been paid to people." 
07/wsj_0776:Says Allen D. Wheat, head of trading at Bankers Trust Co.: "People are just plain scared." 
07/wsj_0776:"I'm glad to be out," said the 32-year-old Mr. Hartley in a phone interview. "The percentage of your day spent twiddling your thumbs got greater, and the work day kept getting longer.
07/wsj_0777:That, in turn, could substantially reduce the value of the television assets. 
07/wsj_0777:The appointment of Peat Marwick, which has a unit that specializes in advising troubled companies, came about as a result of a round of meetings held by Qintex Australia Chairman Christopher Skase with bank creditors. 
07/wsj_0777:Yesterday, Mr. Skase said the company is "solvent and with the continued support of its bankers is able to meet its financial commitments." 
07/wsj_0777:Qintex Australia is a unit of Qintex Ltd.
07/wsj_0778:The issue has come to a boil in Newark, N.J., where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for Eddie Antar that if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted, the government may move to seize the money that Mr. Antar is using to pay legal fees. 
07/wsj_0778:In those cases, the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment. 
07/wsj_0778:A seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs. 
07/wsj_0778:"The people who suffer in the short run are defendants, but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people, because there won't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights," says Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures. 
07/wsj_0778:According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar's case, prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure.
07/wsj_0778:In a letter, prosecutors told Mr. Antar's lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court rulings, they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized.
07/wsj_0778:In Newark, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said, "I don't think there's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney's fees to drug cases." Mr. Alito said his office "just responded to an attorney's question about whether we would go after attorney's fees, and that is different from actually doing it, although we reserve that right." 
07/wsj_0778:In that suit, the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a "massive financial fraud" to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie, Edison, N.J., over a three-year period.
07/wsj_0778:Mr. Antar, the SEC said, made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987. 
07/wsj_0778:Still, criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers' fees.
07/wsj_0778:They also worry that if the government applies asset-forfeiture laws broadly, the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid. 
07/wsj_0779:The stock market correction of Oct. 13, 1989, was a grim reminder of the Oct. 19, 1987 market collapse.
07/wsj_0779:The situation was like that of a skier who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected bump on the slope.
07/wsj_0779:His skis spread farther and farther apart -- just as buy-sell spreads widen during a financial panic -- and soon he is out of control.
07/wsj_0779:After the 1987 crash, and as a result of the recommendations of many studies, "circuit breakers" were devised to allow market participants to regroup and restore orderly market conditions.
07/wsj_0779:Instead, an appropriate institution should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market: the Federal Reserve.
07/wsj_0779:The availability of timely assistance -- of a backstop -- can help markets retain their resilience.
07/wsj_0779:The stock market is the only major market without a market-maker of unchallenged liquidity or a buyer of last resort. 
07/wsj_0779:Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity, and thereby increasing the danger of inflation, the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market, thus stabilizing the market as a whole. 
07/wsj_0779:The combined value of daily equity trading on the New York Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ over-the-counter market ranges between $7 billion and $10 billion.
07/wsj_0779:And taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money supply, such as happened in October 1987. 
07/wsj_0779:It should seek only to maintain the functioning of markets -- not to prop up the Dow Jones or New York Stock Exchange averages at a particular level.
07/wsj_0779:The Fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the symptom -- the liquidity of the banks. 
07/wsj_0779:But since the member countries of the International Monetary Fund agreed to the "Guidelines to Floating" in 1974, such difficulties have been avoided.
07/wsj_0779:Thus, the mere existence of a market-stabilizing agency helps to avoid panic in emergencies. 
07/wsj_0779:Mr. Heller, now at VISA International, was a governor of the Federal Reserve Board from 1986 until earlier this year.
07/wsj_0780:Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton urged banks to be cautious in financing leveraged buy-outs. 
07/wsj_0780:"Caution should . . . be the rule of the day," said Mr. Leigh-Pemberton in a speech to the Association of Corporate Treasurers' annual dinner. "It would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general, to say nothing of banks, if prudence does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions." 
07/wsj_0780:His remarks were distributed to the press before Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced his resignation last evening.
07/wsj_0780:Bank of England officials said the central bank had no comment on Mr. Lawson's resignation. 
07/wsj_0780:Mr. Leigh-Pemberton reiterated that the exposure of United Kingdom banks to leveraged deals haven't yet reached "worrying levels." However, in light of the risks involved in such transactions, banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions, he said. 
07/wsj_0780:In other comments, he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of securing a change of corporate direction or strategy. "A similar result could sometimes be achieved, at less cost, by changing managements," he said. 
07/wsj_0781:Intel said that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its 80486 microprocessor chip's "floating-point unit", a set of circuits that do certain calculations.
07/wsj_0781:But while International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. say the bugs will delay products, most big computer makers said the flaws don't affect them. "Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development," said Richard Archuleta, director of Hewlett-Packard Co. 's advanced systems development.
07/wsj_0781:Likewise, AST Research Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. said the bugs won't delay their development of 486-based machines. "We haven't modified our schedules in any way," said a Sun spokesman.
07/wsj_0781:Nonetheless, concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of 87.5 cents in Intel's stock to $32 a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading, on volume of 3,609,800 shares, and partly responsible for a drop in Compaq's stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Wednesday.
07/wsj_0781:Yesterday, Compaq plunged further, closing at $100 a share, off $8.625 a share, on volume of 2,633,700 shares. 
07/wsj_0781:Most of Compaq's decline is being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts' expectations. 
07/wsj_0781:The bugs will cause problems in "specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications" such as word-processing and spreadsheets, said Michael Slater, editor of the Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. 
07/wsj_0781:Because of the glitch, however, the company said it doesn't know when its machine will be commercially available.
07/wsj_0781:Intel's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today's personal computers and the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines. 
07/wsj_0781:"Although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon, the 486 is an extremely high-profile product," said Mr. Slater, the newsletter editor. 
07/wsj_0781:Intel's 80486 chip is the Corvette of Intel's microprocessors, a super-fast, super-expensive chip that only the most power-hungry computer users are likely to buy for at least several years. 
07/wsj_0781:Unveiled last April, the chip crams 1.2 million transistors on a sliver of silicon, more than four times as many as on Intel's earlier model, 80386.
07/wsj_0781:Machines using the 486 are expected to challenge higher-priced work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called servers, which connect groups of computers together, and in computer-aided design. 
07/wsj_0781:The 486 is the descendant of a long series of Intel chips that began dominating the market ever since IBM picked the 16-bit 8088 chip for its first personal computer. (A 16-bit microprocessor processes 16 pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer, 32-bit chips.) Since then, Intel has cornered a large part of the market with successive generations of 16-bit and 32-bit chips, all of which can run software written for previous models. 
07/wsj_0781:That's what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the irritation of bugs.
07/wsj_0781:Big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing 486-based machines, which are expected to reach the market early next year. 
07/wsj_0781:Of the big computer makers, only Apple Computer Co. bases its machines on Motorola chips instead. "The 486 is going to have a big impact on the industry," said Hewlett-Packard's Mr. Archuleta. "It's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years.
07/wsj_0782:Bethlehem Steel Corp. has agreed in principle to form a joint venture with the world's second-largest steelmaker, Usinor-Sacilor of France, to modernize a portion of Bethlehem's ailing BethForge division. 
07/wsj_0782:The venture, which involves adding sophisticated equipment to make cast-iron mill rolls, is part of a two-pronged effort to shore up a division that has posted continuing operating losses for several years.
07/wsj_0782:While the joint venture affects only a small part of Bethlehem's operations, it is significant because it marks the first time the nation's No. 2 steelmaker has joined forces with a foreign partner.
07/wsj_0782:He said the move could be the beginning of a broader relationship between the two companies, one that could open up new markets for Bethlehem.
07/wsj_0782:Under terms of the agreement, Usinor's Chavanne-Ketin unit and Bethlehem would establish a modernized facility to make cast-iron mill rolls at the company's cast-iron shop here.
07/wsj_0782:The caster improves the metallurgical quality of the iron mill rolls, which are basically huge rolling pins used to flatten or shape steel products. 
07/wsj_0782:Bethlehem is also working with the United Steelworkers union to consolidate BethForge's two machine shops and four heat-treatment facilities of the press-forge operations.
07/wsj_0783:If you're still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk-bond market, consider the case of Columbia Savings & Loan.
07/wsj_0783:Well, when Congress in its recent S&L bailout mandated that the thrifts sell off all their junk-bond holdings by 1994, it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments thrifts have made.
07/wsj_0783:As followers of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know, there is much talk in Congress and indeed all over Washington about the need to "encourage" long-term investment and discourage the financial sector's presumed obsession with the short term.
07/wsj_0783:It turns out that Columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its soon-to-be-sold junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value.
07/wsj_0783:Congress's ham-handed treatment of the existing structure of junk-bond holdings reminds us of a story in the Journal earlier this year about the Baby Bell companies' desire to have the court-ordered bans lifted on offering information services.
07/wsj_0783:The issue of seeking relief from Congress was raised to Delbert Staley, the chairman of Nynex.
07/wsj_0783:The reality of life in modern America is that if you want to wreck something that works, let it fall into the hands of Congress. 
07/wsj_0784:Most of the 300 employees at the oil company's midtown headquarters building -- including much of senior management -- were unaware of the plan until informed at a morning meeting by Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl.
07/wsj_0784:As part of its restructuring several years ago, Exxon moved most of those out of the city and sold its 53-floor Rockefeller Center skyscraper to a Japanese company. 
07/wsj_0784:But the pullout is an embarrassment to New York City officials, coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies.
07/wsj_0784:Mobil Corp. is in the process of vacating its headquarters here, and huge operations like J.C. Penney & Co. and Trans World Airlines have recently left. 
07/wsj_0784:New York authorities, informed yesterday about the move, reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it. "We are dismayed, but there's nothing we can do about it now," said Stanley Grayson, New York City deputy mayor for finance and economic development. 
07/wsj_0784:"When we were told it was Exxon, it was beyond all expectations; what a coup," said Tom Lewis, senior vice president of Dallas Partnership, the economic development affiliate of the city's Chamber of Commerce.
07/wsj_0784:Exxon said it will build a new headquarters on a 132-acre tract in the 10-year-old Las Colinas complex in the suburb of Irving.
07/wsj_0784:Until the building is completed, Exxon will rent part of an existing office tower.
07/wsj_0784:Las Colinas, once a huge Texas ranch, is a sprawling complex of office buildings, homes and recreational facilities that its developers have been struggling to populate in recent years. 
07/wsj_0784:The company won't say how much it will save, but during at its interim location, sources say it will likely pay rent of $10 to $15 per square foot.
07/wsj_0784:Owners of the building in New York say they will be asking $50 per square foot for rent to fill the space that Exxon is vacating.
07/wsj_0785:Canadian production of market pulp rose 1% in September from a year earlier as the industry operated at 87% of capacity. 
07/wsj_0785:The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 532,000 metric tons of market pulp in September, compared with 527,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
07/wsj_0785:Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper and other products.
07/wsj_0785:Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 
07/wsj_0785:The September 87% operating rate compared with a rate of 101% in August but was unchanged from a year earlier. 
07/wsj_0785:In the first nine months of this year output was 5,377,000 metric tons, down from 5,441,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
07/wsj_0786:IMA Holdings Corp. completed its $3 billion acquisition of American Medical International Inc., purchasing 63 million shares, or 86%, of the Los Angeles-based health-care services concern for $26.50 a share.
07/wsj_0786:The price also includes assumption of about $1.4 billion in debt. 
07/wsj_0786:IMA is a group that includes First Boston Corp. and the Pritzker family of Chicago through the leveraged buy-out fund Harry Gray Melvyn Klein & Partners.
07/wsj_0786:The completion of the merger agreement follows months of twists and turns.
07/wsj_0786:A few days later, American Medical announced sharply lower earnings, taking charges of $24 million for insurance reserves and canceled real estate leases. 
07/wsj_0786:A group including several members of the the Bass family of Texas urged the company to take some steps to maximize shareholder value. 
07/wsj_0786:Other new board members include John S. Harrison and Mark A. Adley of First Boston, James F. Lyons, William S. Goldberg and Harold S. Handelsman. 
07/wsj_0787:Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis. 
07/wsj_0787:In testimony to the Senate securities subcommittee, Mr. Brady disputed the view of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, who told a House panel Wednesday that he doesn't want the ability to halt the markets.
07/wsj_0787:Margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract.
07/wsj_0787:Mr. Brady also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to "end under (its) own weight." Asked whether there is anything Congress should do to curb the LBO boom, Mr. Brady responded, "I think the LBO phenomenon, (while) it won't stop completely, will be a thing of the past." Before taking any action, he advised the panel to "see what the market has produced as a cure." 
07/wsj_0787:The former Wall Street executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading, which has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop two weeks ago. "I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time," he said. 
07/wsj_0787:But Mr. Brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of Congress will try to push through this session.
07/wsj_0787:That bill, proposed by the SEC last year, would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies, mandate large traders' reporting of program or block trades, and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets. 
07/wsj_0788:The Senate Agriculture Committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989.
07/wsj_0788:The proposed legislation has a laudable goal: to assure the integrity of the U.S. futures markets.
07/wsj_0788:However, as is common with sweeping legislation, the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve. 
07/wsj_0788:Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), and Bob Kerrey (D., Neb.), covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated.
07/wsj_0788:The bill also elevates even minor rule infractions to felonies and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct. 
07/wsj_0788:Many aspects of the bill are salutary, providing appropriate public safeguards that can and should be instituted throughout the industry.
07/wsj_0788:Indeed, some of the bill's requirements, including broad representation on the exchanges' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest, already have been put in place by the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange and other futures exchanges. 
07/wsj_0788:Other aspects of the bill, however, are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges, the industry and ultimately the general public. 
07/wsj_0788:One of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker.
07/wsj_0788:Cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets.
07/wsj_0788:Today, trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from U.S. markets with just a few strokes of a keyboard.
07/wsj_0788:The Senate bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading.
07/wsj_0788:The most arbitrary of these is the imposition of "service fees," which will directly widen the cost spread between U.S. and foreign markets. 
07/wsj_0788:Other provisions have a more subtle, but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of U.S. exchanges.
07/wsj_0788:These include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages. 
07/wsj_0788:In addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members, these measures could have other, far-reaching repercussions. 
07/wsj_0788:One section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct.
07/wsj_0788:Nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstances. 
07/wsj_0788:It is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation.
07/wsj_0788:In an already low-profitmargin business, commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public, depriving the private individual of access to the markets. 
07/wsj_0788:Faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade, many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers.
07/wsj_0788:This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers.
07/wsj_0788:A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity. 
07/wsj_0788:Finally, under the bill, a number of legitimate, longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned, unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue.
07/wsj_0788:The affected practices include the placing of oral orders, which is the way most public customer orders are placed, and trading between affiliated brokers, even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client.
07/wsj_0788:Nonetheless, each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the CFTC carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are. 
07/wsj_0788:That temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications, positive and negative, of the proposed resolutions to those problems, and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades. 
07/wsj_0788:Mr. Nastro is chairman of the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in New York and director of commodity administration at Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
07/wsj_0789:The number of people receiving state benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000, or 2.1% of those covered by unemployment insurance, from 2,205,000 the previous week, when the insured unemployment rate was 2.2%. 
07/wsj_0789:Counting all state and federal benefit programs, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 7 fell to 1,784,400 from 1,810,700 a week earlier.
07/wsj_0790:On the hungry streets of Naguib Mahfouz's Cairo, life is nasty, brutish and wickedly entertaining. 
07/wsj_0790:Zaita the "cripple-maker" rearranges the limbs of aspiring beggars -- and takes a cut of every cent they cadge.
07/wsj_0790:Hassan Kamel Ali is a card shark and dope dealer who has a simple creed: "I live in this world, assuming that there is no morality, God or police." For the killer and thief, Said Mahran, fame flows from the barrel of a gun. "One man said you act as a stimulant," a prostitute tells him, "a diversion to relieve people's boredom." 
07/wsj_0790:But it is his portrait of Cairo low-life -- of charlatans and opium addicts, of streets filled with "dust, vegetable litter, and animal dung" -- that made his reputation, and won him the Nobel Prize in 1988. 
07/wsj_0790:Three novels, "The Beginning and the End" (412 pages, $19.95), "The Thief and the Dogs" (158 pages, $16.95), and "Wedding Song" (174 pages, $16.95), recently published by Doubleday offer an uneven sample of the 77-year-old Mr. Mahfouz's talent.
07/wsj_0790:But they do show the range of a restless intellect whose 30-odd novels span five decades and include work of social realism, protest and allegory.
07/wsj_0790:They also chart the evolution of a city that has grown tenfold in the author's lifetime, from a colonial outpost of fez-wearing pashas to a Third World slum choking on its own refuse. "Soon it'll be so crowded," a narrator complains, "that people will start eating each other." 
07/wsj_0790:"The Beginning and the End," easily the best of the three, belongs to Mr. Mahfouz's "realistic" period and it is the one for which he is most renowned.
07/wsj_0790:Published in 1949, it follows the decline of a Cairo family with the saga-like sweep and rich detail that critics often compare to Dickens, Balzac and Galsworthy. 
07/wsj_0790:Mourning for the father is overshadowed by the shame of burying him in a pauper's grave.
07/wsj_0790:As a critique of middle-class mores, the story is heavy-handed.
07/wsj_0790:But its unsentimental sketches of Cairo life are vintage Mahfouz.
07/wsj_0790:We see, smell and hear slums filled with "the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language, rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street." And we meet engaging crooks, such as Hassan "the Head," famed for his head-butting fights, his whoring and his hashish. "`God has not yet ordained that I should have earnings, ' he tells his worried mother." Hassan comes to a bad end, but so does almost everyone else in the book. 
07/wsj_0790:In one sense, this limits him; unlike a writer such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who has a distinctive Latin voice, Mr. Mahfouz's style offers little that can be labeled "Egyptian." But the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible, as the streets of Cairo come alive for the Western reader as vividly as Dickens's London or Dostoevski's St. Petersburg. 
07/wsj_0790:"The Thief and the Dogs," written in 1961, is a taut, psychological drama, reminiscent of "Crime and Punishment." Its antihero, Said Mahran, is an Egyptian Raskolnikov who seeks nobility in robbing and killing. "I am the hope and the dream, the redemption of cowards," he says in one of many interior monologues.
07/wsj_0790:Later, he recalls the words of his Marxist mentor: "The people! Theft! The holy fire!" 
07/wsj_0790:Said's story reflects the souring of socialism under Nasser, whose dictatorial rule replaced the monarchy overthrown in 1952.
07/wsj_0790:His giddy dream of redeeming a life of "badly aimed bullets" by punishing the "real robbers" -- the rich "dogs" who prey on the poor -- leads only to the death of innocents, and eventually to his own. 
07/wsj_0790:Here, the city is dark and laden with symbolism: Said has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of Cairo society.
07/wsj_0790:We never care about Said or the "hypocrites" he hunts. "The Thief and the Dogs" is a pioneering work, the first stream-of-consciousness novel in Arabic, but it is likely to disappoint Western readers. 
07/wsj_0790:The story of a playwright's stage debut unfolds in first-person monologues, in the manner of Faulkner's "The Sound and the Fury." But the device obscures more than it illuminates.
07/wsj_0790:Buried in the work is a meditation on the morality of art, and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world.
07/wsj_0790:The indirectness of his later work reflects both an appetite for new genres and the hazards of art in the Arab world.
07/wsj_0790:"Wedding Song" gives glimpses of a Cairo that has become so much harsher since his youth, when, as he once said, "the poorest person was able to find his daily bread and without great difficulty." The clutter of the 1940s remains, but its color has drained away, and the will to overcome has been defeated.
07/wsj_0790:Cars can't move because of overflowing sewers.
07/wsj_0790:And the ubiquitous opium addict is now a cynical and selfish man who gripes: "Only government ministers can afford it these days!" Having lost their faith in God, in social reform and in opium, Cairenes are left with nothing but their sense of humor. 
07/wsj_0791:Norwood Partners Limited Partnership of Boston said it may make a tender offer for some or all of Phoenix Technologies Ltd. 's common shares. 
07/wsj_0791:Norwood, Mass.-based Phoenix, a once-high-flying maker of software for personal computers, has had substantial losses in the past two quarters.
07/wsj_0791:In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Norwood said it's part of a group that holds 525,546 Phoenix Technologies common shares, or a 5.3% stake. 
07/wsj_0791:Norwood is controlled by Daniel L. Barnett and Paul A. Reese, both officers of Boston-based Oasis Capital Management Inc., a small Boston money management firm.
07/wsj_0791:Also involved in the group is Robert F. Angelo, formerly Phoenix's senior vice president, field operations, who left Phoenix at the beginning of October.
07/wsj_0792:The agreement, subject to approval of union members, would cover about 6,000 workers.
07/wsj_0792:The tentative agreement provides for wage increases of 85 cents an hour retroactive to Sept. 25, 1989, and for increases of 19 cents, 70 cents and 35 cents an hour effective Jan. 1, 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively.
07/wsj_0792:It also provides for benefit adjustments, including a partial restoration of vacations and holidays, as well as work-rule changes to increase productivity. 
07/wsj_0793:Ground zero of the HUD scandal is the Secretary's "discretionary fund," a honey pot used to fund projects that weren't approved through normal HUD channels.
07/wsj_0793:Instead, Congress's idea of reform is to increase this slush fund by $28.4 million.
07/wsj_0793:And transfer control of much of it to Capitol Hill.
07/wsj_0793:After one of the most amazing debates we've ever seen on the cable channel C-SPAN, the House voted 250 to 170 on Wednesday to order $28.4 million in spending for a New Jersey arts center, a Michigan library and 38 other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during Sam Pierce's tenure.
07/wsj_0793:HUD has no paper work whatsoever on 30 of the projects, none of the others has been approved and not a single congressional hearing has been held on any of them.
07/wsj_0793:However, four are in the Michigan district of Rep. Bob Traxler, the chairman of the House subcommittee that writes the HUD spending bill. 
07/wsj_0793:Of course, this kind of blatant congressional pork-barreling is called "constituent service" by Members, while the same kind of noncompetitive favoritism at HUD is labeled "influence peddling." Unlike those awful Republican consultants, Members don't profit directly from HUD projects.
07/wsj_0793:Members find it easy to doctor legislation by slipping in special provisions that could never survive in the cold light of day. 
07/wsj_0794:This is slightly adapted from remarks Oct. 7 by former Secretary of State George P. Shultz to an alumni gathering at the Stanford Business School, where he has returned to the faculty: 
07/wsj_0794:I was struck a couple of years ago by the drug-interdiction effort in the Bahamas.
07/wsj_0794:We had intercepted during the year an estimated $5 billion street value of cocaine.
07/wsj_0794:The GNP of the Bahamas is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars.
07/wsj_0794:So you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about. 
07/wsj_0794:The efforts to get to the people who are addicted, try to rehabilitate them; if they cannot be rehabilitated, at least to contain them; to educate people, to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users, to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important. 
07/wsj_0794:But, I have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work.
07/wsj_0794:The conceptual base -- a criminal-justice approach -- is the same that I have worked through before, in the Nixon administration when I was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the Customs.
07/wsj_0794:You're looking at a guy whose motorcade was attacked in Bolivia by the drug terrorists, so I'm personally a veteran of this war. 
07/wsj_0794:What we have before us now is essentially the same program but with more resources plowed into all of the efforts to enforce and control.
07/wsj_0794:It seems to me we're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it.
07/wsj_0794:Frankly, the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost.
07/wsj_0794:If I am catching your attention, then read a bold and informative article in this September's issue of Science by Ethan Nadelmann on this subject.
07/wsj_0794:We need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs. 
07/wsj_0794:But I feel that if somebody doesn't get up and start talking about this now, the next time around, when we have the next iteration of these programs, it will still be true that everyone is scared to talk about it.
07/wsj_0795:Personal spending, buoyed by a burst of automobile buying, was the main catalyst to the economy's expansion.
07/wsj_0795:But trade, one of the economy's main forces in the past few years, showed a sharp deterioration.
07/wsj_0795:Imports of goods and services soared, while exports were flat. 
07/wsj_0795:Although the economy showed no change of pace from the second quarter, many analysts expect it to slow considerably in the fourth quarter as demand for autos falls, partly because of higher prices on models introduced last month.
07/wsj_0795:Many economists think the rise in the value of the U.S. dollar this year will further crimp progress in trade, because it makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper.
07/wsj_0795:A sharp reduction in inflation was by far the brightest spot in the report on the real gross national product -- the inflation-adjusted market value of all the goods and services the economy produced. 
07/wsj_0795:An inflation gauge that measures the quarterly change in prices of an array of goods and services slowed its growth to a 2.9% annual rate in the third quarter from 5% in the second. 
07/wsj_0795:Much of the moderation came from declining energy prices, which have since turned up a bit, analysts said.
07/wsj_0795:Consequently, Michael Darby, undersecretary for economic affairs at the Commerce Department, said inflation probably will edge up from the third-quarter rate in the final three months of 1989.
07/wsj_0795:Generally, the Bush administration expressed satisfaction with the economy's progress as it heads into its eighth year of sustained growth next month. 
07/wsj_0795:But administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report, which showed the deficit in the country's trade of goods and services swelling to a $74 billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $51 billion rate in the second quarter.
07/wsj_0795:"We were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports," said Daniel Van Dyke, vice president of U.S. forecasting at Bank of America in San Francisco. "I can't believe it will continue," he added, noting that the economies of the country's major trading partners are strong and prices of U.S. products are still competitive. 
07/wsj_0795:Some analysts also were disturbed by a pickup in the growth of business inventories.
07/wsj_0795:While a buildup of these stocks adds to GNP, it can hurt the economy because a pileup of unsold goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs. 
07/wsj_0795:According to the report, inventories outside the farm sector grew at an annual rate of $24.6 billion in the third quarter, up from a $19.5 billion pace in the second quarter.
07/wsj_0795:Here are some of the major components of the gross national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant (1982) dollars: 
07/wsj_0795:In the third quarter, the implicit price deflator fell to 2.9% of the 1982 average, from 4.6% in the previous quarter. 
07/wsj_0796:The contract provides additional equipment for Northrop, the prime contractor on the missile, and also supports a 1990 purchase of 90 missiles for follow-on flight tests. 
07/wsj_0797:General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division said it is offering $750 cash incentives on all 1990 models of its full-size Blazer and Suburban truck lines.
07/wsj_0797:Chevrolet already has cash incentives on the 1989 models of these vehicles. 
07/wsj_0798:Hudson's Bay Co. announced terms of a previously proposed rights issue that is expected to raise about 396 million Canadian dollars (US$337 million) net of expenses. 
07/wsj_0798:Proceeds of the offering will be used to redeem C$264 million of preferred shares and to reduce short-term debt, the company said. 
07/wsj_0798:Canada's largest department store operator said the rights offering will entitle holders of its ordinary shares, except residents in the U.S. and Britain, to subscribe for two additional shares for every five shares held at a price of C$31.25 a share.
07/wsj_0798:Hudson's Bay said that Woodbridge Co., which currently holds about 77% of the ordinary shares, will subscribe for all the shares to which it is entitled and for any shares that aren't otherwise taken up.
07/wsj_0798:Hudson's Bay said it will redeem 9.5 million Series H preferred shares on Oct. 31 at a price of C$27.75 each.
07/wsj_0798:Gary Lukassen, chief financial officer, said redemption of the preferred shares, originally issued at C$25 each, will eliminate dividend payments of C$17.9 million annually. 
07/wsj_0799:Iverson Technology Corp. was one of the fastest-growing small companies in America -- until last year. 
07/wsj_0799:The McLean, Va., company modifies computers to keep sensitive military data out of unfriendly hands.
07/wsj_0799:Iverson Technology is one of many small defense contractors besieged by the slowdown in defense spending.
07/wsj_0799:In the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top Defense Department priority, ERC last year acquired W.J. Schafer Associates, a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the Strategic Defense Initiative.
07/wsj_0799:UNC Inc., an Annapolis, Md., contractor that earned $23.8 million on revenue of $400.4 million in 1988, has gone even further in realigning its military business.
07/wsj_0799:As orders for its aircraft and submarine parts dwindled, three years of steady growth ended with a 69% drop in income in this year's first half.
07/wsj_0799:Among the company's current efforts: repairing old parts at 25% of the cost of replacing them.
07/wsj_0799:UNC also is selling new parts, if needed, directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor.
07/wsj_0799:At as little as one-third of the government's cost, the company is running a program to train Army helicopter pilots.
07/wsj_0799:It is also taking over the maintenance of certain Navy aircraft with 40% fewer people than the military used. 
07/wsj_0799:In another approach, tiny Iverson Technology is trying to resume its growth by braving the new world of commercial products.
07/wsj_0799:Donald Iverson, chairman, says he hopes the company can eventually get up to half of its revenue from commercial markets.
07/wsj_0799:The product automates an array of functions performed at small to medium-size printing companies.
07/wsj_0799:A partnership with a Williamsburg, Va., unit of Shell Oil Co. recently patented a process for producing plastic food containers that won't melt in microwave ovens. 
07/wsj_0799:"We're trying to take the imagination and talent of our engineers and come up with new processes for industry," says Vincent Salvatori, QuesTech's chief executive. "It is an effort to branch out from the government, which is very difficult for a defense contractor." 
07/wsj_0799:Instead of helping his company in the defense spending slowdown, Dynamic Engineering Inc., a troubled subsidiary that makes wind tunnels for the space industry, contributed to much of QuesTech's $3.3 million loss on $55.6 million in revenue last year.
07/wsj_0799:Telos Corp., a Santa Monica, Calif., provider of software-development and hardware-maintenance services to the military, enjoyed steady growth until this year.
07/wsj_0799:Following a tripling of earnings, to $3.9 million, on a doubling of revenue, to $116 million, over four years, earnings in the company's fiscal first quarter, which ended June 30, plunged 90% to $45,000.
07/wsj_0799:Telos responded by combining three of its five divisions to reduce expenses and "bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities," says Lin Conger, Telos chairman and controlling shareholder. "It's evident we're entering a more competitive era," he says. 
07/wsj_0799:TransTechnology Corp., a Sherman Oaks, Calif., defense contractor that earned $9.2 million on revenue of $235.2 million in 1988, provides a more dramatic example of cost-cutting.
07/wsj_0799:"Our ordnance business has been hurt very badly by the slowdown," says Arch Scurlock, TransTechnology's chairman. "I wouldn't say we're out of the business.
08/wsj_0800:The growing crowd of Japanese investors buying up foreign companies aren't all strait-laced businessmen in dark suits. 
08/wsj_0800:In Japan, he's known in racy weekly magazines as the "King of Shady Money." If nothing else, the 57-year-old's past has its share of dents. 
08/wsj_0800:Nearly 20 years ago, Mr. Morishita, founder and chairman of Aichi Corp., a finance company, received a 10-month suspended sentence from a Tokyo court for violating a money-lending law and an income tax law.
08/wsj_0800:He was convicted of charging interest rates much higher than what the law permitted, and attempting to evade income taxes by using a double accounting system. 
08/wsj_0800:He was arrested, though not indicted, on at least three other occasions in the '60s and '70s: for assault and unlawful confinement, for fraud and forgery of private documents, and for extortion. 
08/wsj_0800:Many of these financiers lend freely, often without demanding collateral.
08/wsj_0800:Aichi is a machikin, Mr. Utsunomiya says, and "one of the nasty ones." In describing that business in general, he says that when the client can't repay the loan, some machikin "clutch on like hyenas" and even take over the client's company.
08/wsj_0800:Last month, Mr. Morishita's new gallery, Aska International Ltd., purchased 6.4% of Christies for #33 million ($53.3 million).
08/wsj_0800:Acquired from Carisbrook Holdings U.K. Ltd., a company owned by Australian financier Robert Holmes a Court, the stake was apparently the first of its kind for Aska, an entity separate from Aichi.
08/wsj_0800:And the acquisition, which made Aska one of Christies' top five shareholders, left many people wondering who this man was and what his intentions were. 
08/wsj_0800:Mr. Morishita considers himself a connoisseur of art.
08/wsj_0800:In 30 years of collecting impressionist and Japanese paintings, he has acquired 600 items, he says, enough to persuade him to start a museum next year.
08/wsj_0800:The Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese daily, last month reported that Aichi revised its tax calculations after being challenged for allegedly failing to report all of its income to tax authorities over a two-year period.
08/wsj_0800:The Tokyo Regional Taxation Office declines to comment, and Mr. Kori, the tycoon's secretary, says the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what was considered income. 
08/wsj_0800:The small, wiry Mr. Morishita comes across as an outspoken man of the world.
08/wsj_0800:Not many people know the details of Mr. Morishita's business, but it's a source of rumors about shady dealings.
08/wsj_0800:The seventh child of a store owner in Aichi prefecture, Mr. Morishita started out in the textile business.
08/wsj_0800:He spends most weekends flying his helicopter to one of his nine courses, he says, two of which were designed by Jack Nicklaus.
08/wsj_0800:Even in Denenchofu, one of Tokyo's richest neighborhoods, Mr. Morishita's splashy brick manor -- one of some 10 houses he owns -- outshines the neighbors'.
08/wsj_0801:WHO'S NEWS: Arthur Price resigned as president and chief executive officer of MTM Enterprises Inc., a Studio-City, Calif., entertainment concern.
08/wsj_0801:MTM is a unit of British-based TVS Entertainment PLC, whose chief executive officer, James Gatward, will oversee the company until a successor is named. 
08/wsj_0802:As expected, First Interstate Bancorp reported a net loss of $15.5 million for its third quarter because of hemorrhaging at its First Interstate Bank of Arizona unit. 
08/wsj_0802:The Los Angeles-based bank holding company disclosed last Friday that it had taken a huge $350 million provision for loan losses at the Arizona bank, the result of the state's worsening real-estate market. 
08/wsj_0802:In yesterday's report, First Interstate said its bank in Texas also reported a loss of $23.5 million for the quarter.
08/wsj_0803:The Labor Department said wage settlements in the third quarter called for average annual wage increases of 3.6% in the first year and 3.0% over the life of the contracts. 
08/wsj_0803:The last time parties to these settlements negotiated wage increases, mostly in 1986 or 1987, wages increased an average of 2.4% a year over the life of the contracts. 
08/wsj_0803:This reflects the restoration of wage cuts in the steel and other industries as well as higher wages granted nurses who work in health-care facilities. 
08/wsj_0803:Settlements reached in the first nine months of 1989 called for wage increases averaging 3.7% in the first contract year and 3.1% annually over the life of the contracts, the department said.
08/wsj_0803:For all of 1988, union contracts provided for 2.5% wage increases in the first year and 2.4% over the life of the contracts. 
08/wsj_0803:In the second quarter, contracts called for increases of 3.9% in the first year and 3.4% over the life of the contracts. 
08/wsj_0803:The figures exclude lump-sum payments and cost-of-living adjustments, so the actual wage increases may have been bigger.
08/wsj_0803:About 35% of the workers covered by contracts signed in the first nine months of year get lump-sum payments; about 15% are covered by cost-of-living clauses.
08/wsj_0803:For all six million workers under major collective bargaining agreements, regardless of when they were signed, wage increases in the first nine months of 1989 averaged 2.5% -- including cost-of-living adjustments. 
08/wsj_0804:"Batibot," which started in 1983 as a hybrid of the U.S. program "Sesame Street," has developed into a distinctly Philippine effort.
08/wsj_0804:In the process, "Batibot," an archaic Filipino word meaning "strong" or "enduring," has become a powerful advocate of the use of the Filipino language. "It impresses on ordinary, young Filipinos that there's nothing to feel inferior about in using their own language," says Randy David, a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show. 
08/wsj_0804:"When we started the program six years ago, the use of Filipino was deemed unwise by the predominantly middle class," says Lydia Brown, the program's creator.
08/wsj_0804:The success of "Batibot" stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote Filipino as a national language.
08/wsj_0804:Filipino -- once known as Pilipino -- is predominantly Tagalog, the Malay-based language spoken in a part of the country's principal island of Luzon. 
08/wsj_0804:Resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country's elite, who generally prefer English.
08/wsj_0804:But while better-off Filipinos are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as English, they are often slow to reveal that they are prejudiced against Filipino, say advocates of the native language. "For the middle and upper-middle class {Filipino} is declasse," says Bien Lumbera, a Philippine-studies professor at Quezon City's University of the Philippines. 
08/wsj_0804:Other opponents of Filipino come from non-Tagalog regions.
08/wsj_0804:They argue that their own languages should have equal weight, although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country's population understands Filipino more than any other language. (There are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in the country.) 
08/wsj_0804:It is entrenched in the country's colonial bonds to the U.S., in Philippine class structure, in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography.
08/wsj_0804:As they did when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S., teachers for the most part teach in English, even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children.
08/wsj_0804:When President Corazon Aquino, whose command of Filipino is spotty, announced last year that the language would be used in official communications, there was an uproar from many legislators, who continue to conduct debates mostly in English. 
08/wsj_0804:But many proponents of Filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling.
08/wsj_0804:According to chief scriptwriter Rene Villanueva, "Batibot" doesn't set out to advance the cause of Filipino. "It's not as if we're teaching language per se," he says, "We're just using it." 
08/wsj_0804:These days, "Batibot" is produced in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $3,000 a one-hour segment.
08/wsj_0804:It is shown weekdays on two of the country's five networks. 
08/wsj_0804:"Batibot" lacks the polish of "Sesame Street." Sound stages echo.
08/wsj_0804:But the production is the equal of any local program.
08/wsj_0805:The Dearborn, Mich., energy company stopped paying a dividend in the third quarter of 1984 because of troubles at its Midland nuclear plant.
08/wsj_0805:In addition, CMS reported third-quarter net of $68.2 million, or 83 cents a share, up from $66.8 million, or 81 cents a share, a year ago. 
08/wsj_0806:HEALTHDYNE Inc., Atlanta, said its subsidiary, Home Nutritional Services Inc., registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission an initial public offering of four million shares of common.
08/wsj_0806:The in-home health care services provider said it will sell 1.8 million of the new shares, while Home Nutritional Services will sell the remaining 2.2 million.
08/wsj_0806:It will have 11.8 million shares outstanding after the offering, with Healthdyne owning about 65% of the total. 
08/wsj_0807:Bostik is the first Emhart Corp. unit to be sold as part of the power-tool manufacturer's effort to reduce debt and consolidate operations after it acquired Emhart earlier this year. 
08/wsj_0807:Black & Decker said it plans to put other Emhart units on the block in the future, with the goal of raising $1 billion in net proceeds. 
08/wsj_0807:Black & Decker rescued Emhart from the takeover bid of Topper Limited Partnership last March by agreeing to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $2.8 billion. 
08/wsj_0807:The acquisition boosted Black & Decker's ratio of debt to total capital to more than 80%.
08/wsj_0807:The three units had combined 1988 sales of about $904 million.
08/wsj_0807:The three units contributed about a third of Emhart's total sales. 
08/wsj_0807:Bostic is one of the previously unnamed units, and the first of the five to be sold. 
08/wsj_0807:The company is still negotiating the sales of the other four units and expects to announce agreements by the end of the year.
08/wsj_0807:The five units generated sales of about $1.3 billion in 1988, almost half of Emhart's $2.3 billion revenue.
08/wsj_0807:Bostic posted 1988 sales of $255 million. 
08/wsj_0807:"Our divestiture program is on schedule, and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over $1 billion in net proceeds," said Nolan D. Archibald, Black & Decker's president and chief executive officer, in a statement. 
08/wsj_0807:The company didn't announce the sale until after the close of the market. 
08/wsj_0808:Congress has decided to raise $40 million by charging companies $20,000 for the honor of filing the required papers under the Hart-Scott-Rodino law.
08/wsj_0808:Ever since the bad days of Big is Bad antitrust enforcement, this law has required that anyone proposing a merger must make a filing describing the effects on all relevant markets.
08/wsj_0808:Typically, Hart-Scott is used now to give managers of target firms early news of a bid and a chance to use regulatory review as a delaying tactic. 
08/wsj_0808:The $20,000 tax would be a small cost in a multibillion-dollar deal, but a serious drag on thousands of small, friendly deals.
08/wsj_0808:One especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.
08/wsj_0808:Also, as former Reagan antitrust chief Charles Rule has noted, this would "establish the precedent that the government may charge parties for the privilege of being sued regardless of whether the government prevails." 
08/wsj_0809:Mr. Grobstein had been a vice chairman of Ernst & Whinney, an accounting firm that merged with rival Arthur Young in July to form Ernst & Young, a major accounting, tax and management consulting firm.
08/wsj_0810:At a news conference, Mr. Fournier accused Paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company, whose interests include insurance, banking, tuna canning, sugar and orange juice. 
08/wsj_0810:The chairman said his board members, including representatives of West German insurance giant Allianz AG and French banks Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, hold nearly 50% of Navigation Mixte's capital. 
08/wsj_0810:At the same time, he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying Paribas's bid.
08/wsj_0810:That is due mostly to payments from Allianz for most of the 50% stake it has agreed to acquire in Navigation Mixte's insurance business.
08/wsj_0810:Mr. Fournier also noted that Navigation Mixte joined Paribas's core of shareholders when Paribas was denationalized in 1987, and said it now holds just under 5% of Paribas's shares.
08/wsj_0810:The petition is still pending, but Mr. Fournier downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the much-larger Paribas. 
08/wsj_0810:One big question now is the likely role of Mr. Fournier's allies.
08/wsj_0810:Mr. Fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly 50% of Navigation Mixte's capital all strongly support him, but some analysts said they aren't so sure.
08/wsj_0810:The purchase of the additional 48% stake is expected to cost more than 11 billion francs ($1.77 billion). 
08/wsj_0810:Paribas says it will offer 1,850 francs ($296.95) each for Navigation Mixte shares that enjoy full dividend rights, and 1,800 francs each for a block of shares issued July 1, which will receive only partial dividends this year.
08/wsj_0810:The Paribas offer values Navigation Mixte at about 23 billion francs, depending on how many of Navigation Mixte's warrants are converted into shares during the takeover battle. 
08/wsj_0811:BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT CORP. said it raised $92 million from an offering of liquid yield option notes.
08/wsj_0811:The gross proceeds from the sale of the notes, which will be due on Nov. 1, 2004, will be used to reduce existing debt and for general corporate purposes, the company said.
08/wsj_0811:In addition, each note can be converted into Blockbuster Entertainment common stock at a rate of 13.851 shares per note.
08/wsj_0811:The notes will have a principal amount of $300 million at maturity.
08/wsj_0812:The 1986 Tax Reform Act has nearly eliminated the number of large, profitable corporations that don't pay federal income tax, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, a nonprofit, labor-funded research and lobbying group. 
08/wsj_0812:In a study of 250 of the nation's richest companies, the group found that only seven managed to avoid paying federal income taxes last year compared with 40 in 1986, the last year the old tax rules were in effect, and 16 in 1987, when some of the new tax provisions went into effect. 
08/wsj_0812:Moreover, 41 companies that paid no federal income tax from 1981 through 1985 -- despite billions of dollars of profits -- ended up paying an average of 27.9% of their income in federal taxes in 1988. 
08/wsj_0812:The report, released yesterday, comes as Congress is considering a number of special tax breaks only three years after the sweeping tax-revision legislation abolished or curtailed many loopholes. 
08/wsj_0812:In the corporate realm, the 1986 law abolished the investment-tax credit, scaled back use of an accounting method that allowed large contractors to defer taxes until a project was completed and strengthened the so-called alternative minimum tax, a levy to ensure all money-making businesses pay some federal tax. 
08/wsj_0812:The combination of lower rates and fewer loopholes has meant that the so-called average effective tax rate -- the rate actually paid -- of the 250 corporations surveyed reached 26.5% in 1988, compared with 14.3% in the years from 1981 through 1985, according to the study. 
08/wsj_0812:In addition, corporations are now shouldering a bigger share of the tax burden, as the authors of the 1986 law hoped.
08/wsj_0812:Corporate taxes paid for almost 12% of federal spending in 1988 -- excluding Social Security -- compared with less than 8% in the first half of the 1980s, the study found. 
08/wsj_0812:"Tax reform is working," the study said. "Under the new tax-reform law, the days of widespread, wholesale corporate tax avoidance have come to an end." 
08/wsj_0812:Still, Kroger Co., Pinnacle West Capital Corp., CSX Corp., Illinois Power Co., Media General Inc., Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. and Gulf States Utilities Co., didn't pay any federal income tax last year although they garnered a total of $1.2 billion in profits, the group said.
08/wsj_0812:In fact, six of those companies received refunds, which totaled $120 million. 
08/wsj_0812:And 45 companies paid effective tax rates of below 10% of their income. "While the overall picture is very encouraging, significant corporate tax avoidance continues," the study said. 
08/wsj_0813:He retains his titles of president and chief operating officer and succeeds as chief executive Howard O. Painter Jr., who remains chairman of the board.
08/wsj_0814:In search of buyers for upscale department-store chains such as Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue, investment bankers are turning to -- who else?
08/wsj_0814:But operating a U.S. department-store chain would be very difficult," says Motoyuki Homma, managing director of the international division at Mitsukoshi Ltd., one of Japan's leading department stores. 
08/wsj_0814:Japanese department stores are also wary of attracting negative publicity.
08/wsj_0814:After Sony Corp. 's recent headline-grabbing acquisition of Columbia Pictures, many say it makes good political sense to lie low. "It's a question of timing," says Mayumi Takayama, managing director of international operations at Isetan Co., a Tokyo department store. 
08/wsj_0814:And debt-ridden Campeau Corp. of Toronto is giving up the 17-store Bloomingdale's group. 
08/wsj_0814:Paying off that debt put such a squeeze on Campeau and its stores that Federated decided to sell off the jewels of its retailing empire, including Bloomingdale's. 
08/wsj_0814:Persuading tradition-bound Japanese retailers to get involved in the turmoils of the U.S. retailing industry isn't likely to be so easy, analysts say.
08/wsj_0814:It said the regular 1988 deficit amounted to $43.5 million, based on revenue of $74.4 million and expenses of $117.9 million.
08/wsj_0814:But it said extraordinary expenditures for its radio station and restoration of buildings increased the deficit to $57.2 million. 
08/wsj_0814:A statement from the council of cardinals said Catholics had responded generously to an appeal last year to give more money after 1987's record $63 million deficit.
08/wsj_0814:Council member Cardinal Gerald Carter of Toronto told Vatican Radio: "Now that we say we covered our deficit this year, people are going to relax and say well that's fine, the Holy See is out of the hole.
08/wsj_0814:Former President Richard Nixon is to visit China at the invitation of the government beginning Saturday, the Foreign Ministry announced.
08/wsj_0814:There will be no sightseeing, no shopping and no social events." Mr. Nixon's office said the former president "expects to have one-on-one discussions with the major Chinese leaders" and will give his assessment of those leaders to President Bush upon his return. 
08/wsj_0814:A poll conducted in 12 of 16 NATO countries shows that the Dutch appear to be the strongest supporters of the alliance.
08/wsj_0814:The poll, conducted for the Dutch daily De Telegraaf by Gallup International said 81% of Dutch people supported NATO. Canada was the second most pro-NATO country with 78% supporting the alliance, followed by the U.S. with 75%, Britain with 71%, Belgium with 69% and West Germany with 63%.
08/wsj_0814:The Israeli Manufacturers' Association filed a police complaint against an Arab pasta maker for using the four colors of the outlawed Palestinian flag on spaghetti packages. "We asked police to investigate why they are allowed to distribute the flag in this way.
08/wsj_0814:Akio Tanii, president of Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., presented the U.S. consul general in Osaka with a $1 million check to help San Francisco's earthquake victims.
08/wsj_0814:The company's U.S. subsidiary, Matsushita Electric Corp. of America, had donated over $35,000 worth of Matsushita-made flashlights and batteries to residents shortly after the disaster, a company spokesman said.
08/wsj_0814:Sumitomo Bank donated $500,000, Tokyo prefecture $15,000 and the city of Osaka $10,000. 
08/wsj_0814:This autumn's edition of the biannual fair will run through Oct. 31.
08/wsj_0814:But China's official Xinhua News Agency reported that the number of foreign businessmen was greater than the previous fair -- without providing statistics. 
08/wsj_0814:In another sign of glasnost, Alexander Solzhenitsyn's long-banned chronicle of Soviet repression, "The Gulag Archipelago," is now recommended reading in one 11th-grade Moscow history class. . . . British customs officers said they'd arrested eight men sneaking 111 rare snakes into Britain -- including one man who strapped a pair of boa constrictors under his armpits.
08/wsj_0815:Di Giorgio Corp. said it's continuing talks with potential buyers of certain units, but has reached no agreement on any deals. 
08/wsj_0815:Di Giorgio, a food wholesaler and building products maker, is seeking alternatives to an unsolicited $32-a-share tender offer of DIG Acquisition Corp., a unit of Rose Partners Limited Partnership.
08/wsj_0815:Robert Mellor, Di Giorgio's executive vice president, said the company stands to reap more money through the sale of individual units to others than by accepting DIG's offer. 
08/wsj_0816:The dollar rose modestly against the mark and the yen, but soared against the pound following the resignation of Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson. 
08/wsj_0816:The less-than-robust third-quarter results came amid renewed concern about the volatility of stock prices and the role of computer-aided program trading.
08/wsj_0816:Taken together, the worries prompted a broad sell-off of stocks.
08/wsj_0816:The number of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange that fell in price yesterday exceeded 1,000, a key measure of underlying sentiment among technical analysts. 
08/wsj_0816:"There are a lot more downward revisions of earnings forecasts than upward revisions," said Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert. "People are questioning corporate profits as a pillar of support for the equity market." 
08/wsj_0816:While bond investors would have preferred growth to be a little slower, they were cheered by inflation measures in the data that showed prices rising at a modest annual rate of 2.9%.
08/wsj_0817:The House joined the Senate in making federal reparations for Japanese-Americans held in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement requiring the Treasury Department to meet expedited payments of an estimated $1.25 billion during the next several years. 
08/wsj_0817:The 249-166 roll call came as the chamber approved a compromise bill allocating $17.2 billion to the departments of State, Justice, and Commerce in fiscal 1990 and imposing increased fees on business interests making filings with the government. 
08/wsj_0817:Yesterday's vote on Japanese-American reparations ensures final enactment of the entitlement provision, which abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts but is seen as a more realistic path to expediting compensation first authorized in 1988. "The only way to reduce the costs is to say we don't want to pay the bill," said Rep. Neal Smith (D., Iowa), who taunted President Bush's party to back up his campaign promise of supporting the claims of $20,000 per individual. "Read my lips," said Mr. Smith. "If you're for paying the claims . . . I don't know how anyone can oppose this." 
08/wsj_0817:No payments would be made this year, but beginning in fiscal 1991, the bill commits the government to annual payments of as much as $500 million until the total liability of $1.25 billion is met. 
08/wsj_0817:The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil-rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority.
08/wsj_0817:The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures, and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the Legal Services Corp. 
08/wsj_0817:The measure provides $321 million to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to by the Bush administration.
08/wsj_0817:The conservative bent of the incumbent appointees, named by former President Reagan, has divided Republicans.
08/wsj_0817:The Federal Bureau of Investigation is slated to receive $30 million by charging for fingerprint services in civil cases, and the judiciary will rely on another $32 million from bankruptcy charges, including a 33% increase in the current filing fee. 
08/wsj_0817:The $17.2 billion total for the bill doesn't include an estimated $1.2 billion in supplemental anti-drug funds approved by the House-Senate conference yesterday, and the rush of money is already provoking jealousy among states competing for assistance. 
08/wsj_0817:Few are more powerful in the competition for funds than the appropriations committees themselves -- including the three authors of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law. 
08/wsj_0817:The measure includes $2 million secured by Mr. Rudman for a marine-research project at the University of New Hampshire, and Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) used his power to add $10 million for an advanced technology initiative in the Commerce Department.
08/wsj_0818:The Big Three U.S. auto makers posted losses in their core North American automotive businesses for the third quarter, and expectations of continued slow vehicle sales and price wars are casting a pall over the fourth period. 
08/wsj_0818:The strongest sign of the Big Three's woes came from Ford Motor Co., which said it had a loss in its U.S. automotive business for the first time since 1982.
08/wsj_0818:Ford predicted fourth-quarter net income will fall below the year-earlier level, partly because of a likely $500 million charge from the sale of its steel operations. 
08/wsj_0818:Still, the combined profit of Ford, Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp. fell 44% to $1.02 billion from $1.83 billion a year earlier, excluding a one-time gain of $309 million at Chrysler from the sale of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. stock.
08/wsj_0818:The last time all three companies reported North American automotive losses was in the recession year of 1982. 
08/wsj_0818:Yesterday's announcements helped spark a midday wave of program selling in the stock market.
08/wsj_0818:GM probably had the "heaviest incentives," said Robert S. Miller, Chrysler's chief financial officer. "We all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them." 
08/wsj_0818:But the costly efforts did little to slow Japanese market gains, and domestic car sales have plunged 19% since the Big Three ended many of their programs Sept. 30.
08/wsj_0818:Ford, which has long boasted of its ability to weather a downturn, saw earnings take a beating.
08/wsj_0818:The No. 2 auto maker blamed incentive costs and reduced production -- both the result of a substantially weaker U.S. market -- for a 44% drop in net to $477.1 million, or $1.03 a share, on revenue of $20.24 billion. 
08/wsj_0818:The Dearborn, Mich., auto maker ran a loss of $37 million on assembling and marketing cars in the U.S., a deterioration of $378 million in that line from the 1988 quarter. 
08/wsj_0818:Ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services.
08/wsj_0818:A year earlier, Ford reported record net of $856.3 million, or $1.78 a share, on revenue of $20.38 billion.
08/wsj_0818:The U.S. automotive loss was a sharp reversal for a company that had reeled off 12 consecutive quarters of improved earnings until the 1989 second quarter.
08/wsj_0818:Still, Mr. McCammon said Ford expects the U.S. economy to weaken through the end of 1990, causing weaker sales and production.
08/wsj_0818:Part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as much as $500 million from the proposed sale of its Rouge Steel unit.
08/wsj_0818:In the 1988 fourth quarter, Ford had net of $1.16 billion, or $2.42 a share. 
08/wsj_0818:Its $309 million, or $1.32 a share, gain from the sale of 75 million Mitsubishi shares made net $331 million, or $1.42 a share.
08/wsj_0818:The results include record quarterly earnings of $76 million from Chrysler Financial Corp.
08/wsj_0818:Mr. Miller said costs of incentives caused a "moderate" loss in the Highland Park, Mich., company's North American car and truck business.
08/wsj_0818:Mr. Miller said Chrysler spent an average of $1,000 a vehicle on its incentive programs in the third quarter, compared with about $450 a vehicle a year earlier -- a "high-water mark" at the time. 
08/wsj_0818:He said Chrysler "is no longer sure" of its forecast for industry car and truck sales of 14.2 million in the 1990 model year.
08/wsj_0818:In the nine months, net was $1.02 billion, or $4.38 a share, including the gain from the Mitsubishi stock sale, compared with $617 million, or $2.77 a share, after a charge of $93 million, or 42 cents a share, for plant closings in the 1988 period.
08/wsj_0818:But analysts estimated that GM had a loss of as much as $300 million on domestic vehicle operations. 
08/wsj_0818:An 8.5% drop in North American factory sales of cars and trucks cut into revenue, and rebates to dealers and customers more than offset gains from price increases on 1990 model vehicles delivered during the period, a GM spokesman said. 
08/wsj_0818:But GM's results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations.
08/wsj_0818:In one breakdown, GM attributed half of its net to its two big technology units, Electronic Data Systems Corp. and GM Hughes Electronics Corp. Meanwhile, GM said overseas auto operations are on track to exceed last year's record full-year net of $2.7 billion. 
08/wsj_0818:The diversified operations helped GM build its cash reserves, exclusive of its financial subsidiary, to $5.5 billion as of Sept. 30, a 22% increase from a year earlier.
08/wsj_0818:Under the circumstances, it won't be easy for GM to exceed its record 1988 fourth-quarter net of $1.4 billion, the spokesman acknowledged.
08/wsj_0818:That means it's unlikely the company will surpass last year's $4.9 billion full-year profit, even though net for the first nine months was up 1.9% to $3.52 billion on revenue of $95.57 billion.
08/wsj_0818:It earned $3.46 billion on revenue of $91.21 billion in the 1988 nine months. 
08/wsj_0818:slides represents income before $309 million after-tax gain from sale of stock 
08/wsj_0819:There are two versions of "Measure for Measure" on stage at the Alley Theater here.
08/wsj_0819:One is a strong, vigorous portrayal of Shakespeare's play; the other is director Gregory Boyd's overlay of present-day punk rock decadence on old Vienna. 
08/wsj_0819:"Measure for Measure" is one of Shakespeare's "problem" plays, so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy, comedy or history.
08/wsj_0819:Its ambiguity and uneasy mixture of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in vogue with directors just now. 
08/wsj_0819:In the play, the Duke of Vienna despairs over the licentiousness of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the puritanical Angelo, hoping he can set things right.
08/wsj_0819:When, however, Claudio's sister, Isabella, a novitiate in a convent, goes to Angelo to plead her brother's case, the obdurate ruler immediately falls in love with her and, in a supreme act of hypocrisy, demands that Isabella yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother's life. 
08/wsj_0819:Meanwhile, the Duke, who set the original scheme in motion, appears on the scene disguised as a friar and becomes involved in a series of intrigues that has everyone fearing the worst possible outcome until the Duke arranges a last minute reprieve for all concerned. 
08/wsj_0819:For the Alley production, scene designer Peter David Gould has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a rectangular platform of white-washed boards that extends into the audience.
08/wsj_0819:When the action requires, a prison cell, consisting of an enlarged wire cage, rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform. 
08/wsj_0819:In the play's major scenes Mr. Boyd demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the Shakespearean dynamic.
08/wsj_0819:At such moments Mr. Boyd makes it clear that he has the capacity to be a superior interpreter of Shakespeare. 
08/wsj_0819:Mr. Boyd is of the directorial school that believes one must find modern parallels or metaphors to make Shakespeare accessible to today's audiences.
08/wsj_0819:It's a valid approach, but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of imagination and taste. 
08/wsj_0819:In his "Measure," Mr. Boyd has "modernized" the pimps and prostitutes of Vienna whom Angelo is supposed to bring under control by converting them into transvestites, punk rockers and heavy metal types, with a strong emphasis on leather, chains and porno-inspired costumes.
08/wsj_0819:When the opportunist Lucio (Jack Stehlin) visits the convent to inform Isabella of her brother's fate, Lucio not only slaps the mother superior on her rear, but brings along a voluptuous companion (Jill Powell), not in Shakespeare's script, to undulate lasciviously. 
08/wsj_0819:The problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination.
08/wsj_0819:The inclusion at one point, for example, of a list of glitzy modern-day malefactors, ranging from Jim Bakker and Leona Helmsley to Zsa Zsa Gabor, is a bid for a cheap laugh unworthy of Mr. Boyd's ability. 
08/wsj_0819:Her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led Peter Zeisler, head of Theatre Communications Group, to write an editorial in American Theatre magazine condemning the board.
08/wsj_0819:None of this backlash could change the fact that Ms. Brown's regime was remarkably undistinguished and unimaginative. 
08/wsj_0819:Not only is Mr. Boyd giving the theater a new sense of adventure and excitement on stage, the balance sheet is the best the theater has had in 10 years.
08/wsj_0819:As opposed to the $1.4 million deficit of the 1987-88 season, the 1988-89 year concluded with a $200,000 surplus and a $500,000 cash reserve. 
08/wsj_0819:Only time will tell if Mr. Boyd can restore to the Alley the acclaim it received when its founder, Nina Vance, was at the height of her powers.
08/wsj_0820:Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said he intends to use Senate procedures to force advocates of the tax cut to come up with at least 60 votes before they can address the issue.
08/wsj_0820:Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), the leading Republican proponent of the tax cut, didn't disagree. "I'm not sure what's going to happen," he said.
08/wsj_0820:The Republicans show no sign of relenting.
08/wsj_0820:They accuse the Democrats of unfairly using Senate rules to erect a 60-vote hurdle.
08/wsj_0820:The two sides also traded accusations about the cost of the Packwood plan.
08/wsj_0820:Democrats asserted that the proposal, which also would create a new type of individual retirement account, was fraught with budget gimmickry that would lose billions of dollars in the long run.
08/wsj_0820:It also would create a new IRA that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes, including retirement, medical expenses, first-home purchases and tuition. 
08/wsj_0820:A White House spokesman said President Bush is "generally supportive" of the Packwood plan. 
08/wsj_0821:Brazil will get two loans amounting to $147 million for schools, roads and other projects in urban areas and to help finance agricultural research projects in the Amazon and northeastern regions of the country. 
08/wsj_0822:The move came as the company, hurt by falling plastics prices and two fires at an important plant, reported a third-quarter loss of $21.4 million, or 86 cents a share. 
08/wsj_0822:In the year-earlier quarter, the New York-based maker of commodity plastics reported earnings from continuing operations of $94.7 million, or $3.72 a share.
08/wsj_0822:As partial compensation to its shareholders, who received a special $50-a-share cash dividend earlier this year, Quantum declared a 1% stock dividend payable Dec. 1 to stock of record Nov. 10. 
08/wsj_0822:The company said it suspended the cash dividend because of a covenant with some of its bondholders that limits payouts to 50% of retained operating profit from Jan. 1, 1989.
08/wsj_0822:For the nine months, the company has already paid $2.25 a share of dividends on operating earnings of $3.87 a share. 
08/wsj_0822:As previously reported, Quantum has been hurt by a drop of 20% to 30% in prices for polyethylene, a basic ingredient used to make such products as garbage bags, milk jugs, meat packaging and toys. 
08/wsj_0822:Although Quantum has captured about a 20% share of the U.S. polyethylene market, it is more vulnerable to price swings than some of its bigger rivals, including Dow Chemical Co. and Union Carbide Corp., which have much broader business bases. 
08/wsj_0822:In addition, two devastating fires at Quantum's chemical complex in Morris, Ill., caused an estimated loss of $22 million, or 89 cents a share, in the third quarter.
08/wsj_0822:The plant, which filled about 25% of the company's ethylene needs and represented about 25% of its polyethylene capacity, won't be back on line until early 1991.
08/wsj_0822:A further hit came from expenses connected with Quantum's joint acquisition in August of Petrolane Inc., a propane distributor.
08/wsj_0822:Moreover, Quantum is still in the midst of a three-year plant expansion program valued at about $1.3 billion that will continue to put pressure on its cash flow and earnings. 
08/wsj_0823:Just when it looked like the Nasdaq over-the-counter market might be firming, nervous investors dumped shares of the biggest nonfinancial issues and sent the market tumbling. 
08/wsj_0823:Because of the heavy selling of such large stocks as Intel, Oracle Systems, Apple Computer, Microsoft and Lotus Development, the Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 4.74, or 1%, to 458.15.
08/wsj_0823:Those stocks and other industrial issues are part of the Nasdaq 100 Index, which plunged 8.12, or 1.8%, to 
08/wsj_0823:All three of those stocks declined.
08/wsj_0823:The Other Finance Index -- the barometer of regional banking, real-estate-investment and brokerage issues, dropped 2.58 to 536.94.
08/wsj_0823:The index of small commercial banks was down 2.54 to 440.99 and the index of insurance stocks eased 0.84 to 536.04.
08/wsj_0823:The Nasdaq Financial Index of the 100 largest stocks in the group lost 2.11 to 452.75. 
08/wsj_0823:Mr. Sulya also noted that volume was tepid, totaling only 128.7 million shares. "We were down and it was quiet on top of it.
08/wsj_0823:Some traders complained that OTC market makers are becoming more risk-averse because of the recent volatility.
08/wsj_0823:Tony Cecin, managing director of equity trading at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis, said the overall OTC market is drifting lower in part because "nobody has the nerve to make a bid for anything," he said.
08/wsj_0823:Compaq's quarterly earnings were at the low end of analysts' forecasts, and the company said it is experiencing problems with a new microchip from Intel.
08/wsj_0823:Yesterday, Sun reported net income of seven cents a share, compared with 26 cents a share a year earlier.
08/wsj_0823:General Motors said it is seeking clearance to buy as much as 15% of the company.
08/wsj_0823:On Wednesday, Ford Motor said it had already bought 12.45% of the British company's shares and may bid for the rest.
08/wsj_0823:Buffets slid 1 to 14 after reporting third-quarter earnings of 17 cents a share, one cent below the low end of analysts' estimates.
08/wsj_0823:Chartwell Group plunged 1 1/2 to 1 1/2 after estimating that it had a loss of about $3.2 million in the latest third quarter, before a $5,350,000 addition to loss reserves.
08/wsj_0823:The company also said it wouldn't make the semiannual interest payment on its $40 million of 7% convertible subordinated debentures by the Nov. 1 due date or within the grace period.
08/wsj_0823:Astec Industries tumbled 2 1/8 to 9 7/8 after it reported a $2.4 million loss in the latest third quarter, compared with net income of more than $1 million a year earlier.
08/wsj_0823:Foremost Corp. of America surged 2 1/8 to 36 1/2.
08/wsj_0824:Last year's figures have been restated to reflect the August 1989 mergers of Western Reserve Savings Bank in Cleveland and First Federal Savings of Akron with Charter One.
08/wsj_0824:In an interview, the chief executive attributed the improved results to strength in its core operations, as well as higher volume of loans and fee income, especially relating to tax-deferred annuities.
08/wsj_0824:Because of the mergers, the company had $750,000 in nonrecurring expenses in the latest quarter.
08/wsj_0824:Those expenses, however, were offset by a gain of about $1.7 million on the sale of 35,000 shares of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
08/wsj_0824:The company retains 421,000 shares of Freddie Mac, but expects to continue to sell about 30,000 shares a quarter. 
08/wsj_0824:The company's book value as of Sept. 30 was $23.20 a share, up 17% from a year ago.
08/wsj_0824:Mr. Koch said the increase was due in large part to the addition of the two thrifts. 
08/wsj_0824:In a year when scores of such institutions failed in Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona and other states, Mr. Koch said only a few of Ohio's 221 thrifts have failed. "The institutions in Ohio that failed were primarily those that made loans outside of Ohio," he said. "Those that have succeeded have continued to lend in local areas." 
08/wsj_0824:In addition to Cleveland and Akron, First Federal Savings also serves the Youngstown and Portsmouth areas and in Toledo operates under the name of People's Savings. 
08/wsj_0825:Badly shaken by recent big swings in stock prices and the cloudy outlook for the economy, investors sold many of the consumer-oriented blue chips that were the market's star performers only a week ago.
08/wsj_0825:Many of those issues-such as Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble and Merck -- are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
08/wsj_0825:In a sign of just how nervous investors are, precious-metals stocks were among the best performers yesterday. 
08/wsj_0825:Compaq, a highly sought stock only a few days ago, hit a record high of 112 1/2 on Oct. 19. 
08/wsj_0825:Third-quarter earnings were on the low end of analysts' forecasts, and the company disclosed that it had uncovered two technical flaws in Intel's new microprocessor, which could cause delays in shipments of some new Compaq products.
08/wsj_0825:"When you see what happened to Compaq, it is completely (numbing) for the mentality of the market," said Jack Solomon, technical analyst for Bear Stearns. "It is hard for the mind to digest that what was the leading stock is now the one leading you down the tubes." 
08/wsj_0825:Though that growth was in line with expectations, investors focused on signs of a slowdown: a buildup in inventories and dubious strength in consumer spending. 
08/wsj_0825:Futures-related selling pushed the industrial average about 45 points lower in the morning as rumors about RJR Nabisco's pending sale of its Del Monte foods unit spread through the trading pits in Chicago.
08/wsj_0825:The purchase of Del Monte is likely to be financed with junk bonds or a bridge loan.
08/wsj_0825:However, Donald Selkin, head of futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities, said that the stock market appears to be poised for a round of futures-related selling this morning, given the discrepancies between futures and stocks at the close. 
08/wsj_0825:About $45 million of stock traded through the basket. 
08/wsj_0825:In a sign of the credit needs among market makers during the 190-point plunge on Oct. 13, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said yesterday that loans by New York's nine largest banks for the financing of securities positions rose $786 million, to $6.6 billion during the week ending Oct. 18. 
08/wsj_0825:Anheuser-Busch slid 1/2 to 38 and led the Big Board's list of most active issues as 4.3 million shares were traded.
08/wsj_0825:The stock had plunged 4 3/8 Wednesday on the news of third-quarter earnings weakness and its discounting strategy, which it expects to affect results through the end of 1990. 
08/wsj_0825:Auto stocks slumped as each of the nation's Big Three auto makers reported that third-quarter operating profits were down from 1988.
08/wsj_0825:Ford Motor, which also said it expects results for the fourth quarter to be soft because of a slowdown in auto sales, dropped 3/8 to 47 1/2.
08/wsj_0825:Precious-metals stocks, widely viewed as a safe investment haven in periods of uncertainty, posted solid gains.
08/wsj_0825:Tandy fell 5/8 to 43 3/8 on 1.8 million shares, including a 1.5 million-share block that the company repurchased as part of an ongoing buy-back program.
08/wsj_0825:The block equaled 1.7% of its shares outstanding. 
08/wsj_0825:Nipsco Industries, the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service, rose 1/2 to 17 7/8.
08/wsj_0825:Its board authorized the repurchase of an additional 3.5 million common shares, or about 5% of its shares outstanding, under an ongoing buy-back program. 
08/wsj_0825:Also, the company said it would file for an initial offering of a 20% stake in its Polygram unit, as expected. 
08/wsj_0825:The company's third-quarter pretax profit was 12% lower than the year-ago level and fell short of its expectations. 
08/wsj_0825:The company also suspended payment of cash dividends on its common stock until at least next April; it plans to pay stock dividends instead. 
08/wsj_0825:Earlier this month, a special committee of Telerate's board rejected the bid as inadequate. 
08/wsj_0825:Security Pacific signed a letter of intent to acquire the company in a stock swap valued at $15 a share. 
08/wsj_0826:In a letter to Rep. Tom Lantos (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on housing and employment, the lawyers said Mr. Pierce would invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination at hearings scheduled for today and Friday. 
08/wsj_0826:The letter sent yesterday to Mr. Lantos says Mr. Pierce "is concerned that there continues to be an atmosphere wherein he remains a target of the subcommittee's hearings." 
08/wsj_0826:In the letter, lawyers Paul Perito, Robert Plotkin and Inez Smith say they "hope that sometime in the near future the present level of tension may be reduced such that Mr. Pierce can reconsider his present position and testify under fair and mutually agreeable circumstances." 
08/wsj_0827:Accor S.A. of France withdrew from an agreement to acquire a 51% stake in Greetings Group Ltd., an Australian hotel operator. 
08/wsj_0827:He wouldn't discuss any details of the new proposals. 
08/wsj_0827:In September, Accor entered into an option agreement with major shareholders of Greetings that would have given Accor a 51% stake through an issue of new shares. 
08/wsj_0828:Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission said the proposed #395 million ($637.7 million) acquisition of Tootal Group PLC by Coats Viyella PLC, a U.K. textile manufacturer, could go ahead pending certain conditions. 
08/wsj_0828:The commission said Coats must first dispose of its interest in Britain's domestic sewing thread industry and its shares in the Gutermann Group. 
08/wsj_0828:The panel was concerned that the merger of the two groups would damage competition in British markets for industrial and domestic sewing thread and clothing. 
08/wsj_0828:Coats has offered one ordinary Coats share and 400 pence in cash for every four shares in Tootal, which is the equivalent of 138.4 pence per share. 
08/wsj_0829:President Bush unveiled food-safety proposals that would significantly increase the penalties for the misuse of pesticides. 
08/wsj_0829:Under the plan, released at a White House briefing yesterday, the civil penalty for the illegal sale, distribution or commercial use of a pesticide would be raised to a maximum $25,000 a day for each violation.
08/wsj_0829:The package also contains proposals that would speed the removal of harmful pesticides from the market and would provide for the establishment of consistent "negligible risk" levels for pesticides in fresh and processed food.
08/wsj_0830:And KLUC, a part of Nationwide Communications Inc., couldn't be reached.
08/wsj_0830:Tom Chiusano, vice president and general manager of WXRK-FM in New York, said the FCC decision singling out KLUC seemed unfair because he estimated probably 500 radio stations have played "Erotic City." But Mr. Chiusano has his own problems.
08/wsj_0830:The FCC also sent WXRK a letter saying it believed one of its shows, the Howard Stern Show, contained indecent material. 
08/wsj_0830:But two years ago, when the agency began its crackdown on indecency, Mr. Stern's show, which features a lot of gross jokes, was one of the shows cited in the agency's first warning letters to broadcasters. "Howard Stern doesn't broadcast indecent material," said Mr. Chiusano. "He does four hours of contemporaneous humor." 
08/wsj_0830:Meanwhile the courts have rejected most of the FCC's plans, and the agency has been subject to constant ridicule.
08/wsj_0830:One commissioner even proposed banning a reading of James Joyce's "Ulysses" until cooler heads prevailed. 
08/wsj_0831:RENAISSANCE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT Inc. has standing agreements with several brokerage firms to execute block trades, and designates one of those firms as principal to handle each of those trades.
08/wsj_0832:McDonnell Douglas Corp. reported a 54% drop in third-quarter net income, but its Douglas Aircraft Co. subsidiary appears to be fixing some of its problems. 
08/wsj_0832:The subsidiary posted a $3 million loss for the quarter, but that was after a one-time pretax gain of $25 million stemming from an insurance payment. 
08/wsj_0832:McDonnell Douglas posted third-quarter net of $38 million, or 98 cents a share, down from $83 million, or $2.18 a share, a year earlier.
08/wsj_0832:The latest results include an extraordinary gain of $6 million, or 14 cents a share, from the divestiture of the bulk of the company's information systems group.
08/wsj_0832:Profits for the division tumbled to $67 million from $91 million, primarily because of reduced earnings for its AH-64 Apache helicopter and write-downs on several other helicopter programs.
08/wsj_0832:A number of defense-oriented aerospace companies, including Northrop Corp. and General Dynamics Corp., have reported either flat or lower third-quarter earnings. 
08/wsj_0832:Deliveries of its MD-80 jetliner, which competes primarily with Boeing Co. 's 737 series, jumped to 30 in the third quarter, from 24 in the second period and 28 a year earlier.
08/wsj_0832:Company officials boast that Douglas could account for half of McDonnell Douglas revenues by 1992, compared with about a third now.
08/wsj_0833:Delta Air Lines, in a move that could help it thwart the kind of takeover attempts that have bedeviled other airlines this year, agreed to sell about 5% of its stock to Singapore Airlines Ltd. 
08/wsj_0833:It was the second such transaction for the Atlanta-based airline, which this summer sold a 5% stake to Swissair and placed another 14% of its stock in employees' hands. 
08/wsj_0833:As part of a 10-year marketing agreement with Singapore Airlines announced yesterday, Delta also agreed to spend about $183 million -- the same amount Singapore Airlines will spend for its Delta shares -- to buy a similar stake in Singapore Airlines. 
08/wsj_0833:But they come after a period during which three of the carrier's largest rivals were the subject of takeover bids. 
08/wsj_0833:Under the terms of equity cross-purchase agreements, Singapore Airlines agreed to buy 2.5 million shares of Delta common stock for 110% of its closing price for the four days surrounding its purchase announcement.
08/wsj_0833:Delta agreed to buy the same dollar amount of Singapore Airlines shares. 
08/wsj_0833:As part of the 10-year marketing agreement, the two airlines also plan to coordinate their schedules and possibly operate joint service on certain routes. 
08/wsj_0833:An added benefit for Delta is that its agreement with Singapore Airlines provides a toehold in the Pacific, where U.S. airlines face the best possibility of expansion. 
08/wsj_0834:Louis Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services, announced the move by the Food and Drug Administration after two years of restricted access for the youngest AIDS patients to the only anti-viral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease. 
08/wsj_0834:Under the designation, the drug's maker, Burroughs Wellcome Co., will give the drug free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection.
08/wsj_0834:Burroughs Wellcome is a unit of Wellcome PLC, London. 
08/wsj_0834:But despite nearly two years of research showing AZT can relieve symptoms in children, the drug still lacks federal approval for their use.
08/wsj_0834:To date, 1,013 of those children have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control. 
08/wsj_0835:Pilots of Federal Express Corp. voted to reject affiliation with the Air Line Pilots Association, giving a resounding victory to the company's founder and chairman, Frederick W. Smith. 
08/wsj_0835:In the National Mediation Board election, 709 pilots voted to support the union, out of a total electorate of 2,022 Federal Express aviators.
08/wsj_0835:"We're stunned," said Barney Barnhardt, a captain and leader of the pro-ALPA campaign. "Apparently, we lost a lot of the Tiger votes.
08/wsj_0835:As for the veteran Federal pilots, Mr. Barnhardt said the pro-union side had counted on getting at least 100 of them to support ALPA.
08/wsj_0835:But it seems many fewer than that actually voted for the union, probably because of fears that union rules would hurt them in their battle over seniority issues against the former Tiger pilots. 
08/wsj_0835:Depending on how a mediator reconciles the different job classifications of Federal and Tiger, Federal Express still faces possible union elections this fall among airplane mechanics, ramp workers and stock clerks. 
08/wsj_0836:Reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $1 million or more.
08/wsj_0836:COMMERCIAL PAPER: High-grade unsecured notes sold through dealers by major corporations in multiples of $1,000: 8.55% 30 days; 8.45% 60 days; 8.40% 90 days. 
08/wsj_0836:CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT: 8.09% one month; 8.04% two months; 8.03% three months; 7.96% six months; 7.92% one year.

08/wsj_0836:The average of interbank offered rates for dollar deposits in the London market based on quotations at five major banks. 
08/wsj_0836:TREASURY BILLS: Results of the Monday, October 23, 1989, auction of short-term U.S. government bills, sold at a discount from face value in units of $10,000 to $1 million: 7.52% 13 weeks; 7.50% 26 weeks. 
08/wsj_0836:Annualized average rate of return after expenses for the past 30 days; not a forecast of future returns. 
08/wsj_0837:UAL, parent of United Airlines, said net income fell to $110.9 million, or $5.11 a share, from $402.4 million, or $18.68 a share.
08/wsj_0837:The year-earlier quarter included a one-time after-tax gain of $223.4 million from the sale of interests in its computerized reservations partnership, Covia. 
08/wsj_0837:The company said its third-quarter results reflected the recent sharp climb in UAL stock to $282 a share as of Sept. 29, sparked by bids from Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis and a labor-management buy-out group.
08/wsj_0837:Thus, UAL said it expects to reverse most of the stock appreciation expenses in the fourth quarter. 
08/wsj_0837:As the value of UAL stock rises, the company must reflect this in its accounting methods as an increased expense. 
08/wsj_0837:In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, UAL shares rose $9.75 to $170.75 on volume of 1.1 million shares. 
08/wsj_0837:Most industry analysts expected UAL to report third-quarter earnings of around $7 a share. 
08/wsj_0837:For the nine months, net income fell 71% to $317.3 million, or $14.66 a share, from $1.1 billion, or $34.35 a share, which includes the gain from the sale of Covia interests.
08/wsj_0837:Separately, the leadership of UAL's machinists union met to discuss the possibility of proposing a recapitalization to UAL's board.
08/wsj_0837:Takeover stock traders and other investors, however, have been pushing for some form of recapitalization to regain the losses they suffered when the labor-management bid collapsed. 
08/wsj_0838:When Adolph Coors Co. announced the appointment of William Coors as president late Wednesday, Peter Coors wasn't promoted -- at least not officially. 
08/wsj_0838:But the announcement by the big Golden, Colo., brewer was an implicit statement of Peter Coor's rising role at the company, analysts say.
08/wsj_0838:According to analysts, the changes reflect the tough task the company faces in integrating the operations and marketing efforts of Stroh and Coors, steering the merger through the Justice Department and continuing to fight the battle Coors is waging with Anheuser and Miller Brewing Co., a unit of Philip Morris Cos. 
08/wsj_0838:"It's gray-beard time," said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles consulting firm, referring to the move of William into the presidency. "This is a time of tremendous risk at the company, and Peter has a tremendous amount of responsibility." Putting William at the helm probably won't increase the elder Coors's imput into the beer business, but "it doesn't hurt to have a senior statesman at the top," he said. 
08/wsj_0838:We depend on all his years of experience and knowledge in the industry, and that doesn't change." But in January, Peter said, his uncle told him and his brothers, "You guys run those units." 
08/wsj_0838:Coors stressed that the removal of Jeff from the presidency wasn't a demotion, but would allow him to devote his full attention to his unit.
08/wsj_0838:Coors has continually pointed to the importance of the technology unit to its diversification efforts. 
08/wsj_0838:Analysts also credit Peter with selling other family members on the purchase of Stroh, a transaction that will cost about $425 million and slap a big piece of debt on Coors's books for the first time in the company's history. 
08/wsj_0838:And Peter will continue to be under the gun, given the dominance of Anheuser, the stubbornly flat beer market of the past decade and recent Coors financial results that have been frustratingly mediocre.
08/wsj_0838:Anheuser announced on Wednesday that it would begin discounting Budweiser, its flagship brand, which analysts say will put exceptionally heavy pressure on Coors management in the midst of a major merger. 
08/wsj_0839:Sony Corp. asked a Los Angeles court to deny Warner Communications Inc. 's request for an injunction preventing Hollywood producers Peter Guber and John Peters from taking over the management of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. 
08/wsj_0839:The Japanese concern made its request in Los Angeles Superior Court, where Warner last week filed a $1 billion breach of contract suit against Sony.
08/wsj_0839:Sony, which has agreed to pay $3.5 billion and to assume $1.5 billion in debt to buy Columbia, is also offering $200 million for Guber Peters Entertainment Co., of which the producers are co-chairmen and own a combined 28% stake. 
08/wsj_0839:While executives from both sides say the matter still could be settled, papers filed in the court by Sony appear to heighten the acrimony of Hollywood's most-watched legal battle.
08/wsj_0839:Sony claims an injunction would leave it "faced with the ominous possibility that it would complete a $5 billion entertainment company acquisition and be left with no management to run the company." Sony adds that "Warner must be grinning from ear to ear at the possibility of leaving Sony in such a position and at the opportunity to prevent the revitalization of Columbia into a strong competitor." 
08/wsj_0839:Sony disputes Warner's contention that its offer to Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters violates their contract with Warner, which is in the process of being acquired by New York-based Time Warner Inc. Furthermore, Sony claims that the contract as written -- and oral agreements that Warner has denied exist -- allow the producers to take on such executive posts.
08/wsj_0839:Sony acknowledges that Warner's contract prevents the Guber-Peters team from being producers or executive producers of movies for another studio.
08/wsj_0839:But, Sony says, that doesn't exclude them from taking an executive post at another company where they would be involved in choosing movies and in managing, but not in day-to-day production of movies.
08/wsj_0839:Among the arguments Sony makes is that Warner should let the producers go to Columbia because it already allowed the producers to become co-chairmen of publicly held Barris Industries Inc., which earlier this year changed its name to Guber Peters Entertainment.
08/wsj_0839:Mr. Daly said that Mr. Guber had mentioned such an offer, and that he responded that "I thought the idea was a bad one from his point of view, and I understand he dropped the idea shortly thereafter." 
08/wsj_0839:In a sworn declaration, Walter Yetnikoff, president of Sony's CBS Records unit, said Warner Chairman Steven Ross has an "anti-Japanese, anti-Sony" bias.
08/wsj_0839:In another sworn declaration yesterday, Sony Corp. of America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof said that while he was negotiating with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters, he relied on the producers' assurances that Warner had previously agreed to let them terminate the contract and wouldn't have any trouble obtaining a release. 
08/wsj_0839:Mr. Peters, in his declaration, supported Mr. Guber's claims and said he is "shocked" by the assertions of Warner executives that such an agreement was never made. 
08/wsj_0840:Regional thrift regulators charged that phone calls were bugged during the examination of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association and that federal officials in Washington delayed Lincoln's seizure until its $2.5 billion cost made it the most expensive thrift failure ever. 
08/wsj_0840:"Clearly, we were shot in the back . . . as we battled to protect the taxpayers," said William Black, acting district counsel for the San Francisco region of thrift regulators. 
08/wsj_0840:In a day of extraordinary testimony before the House Banking Committee, officials from the San Francisco Office of Thrift Supervision also testified that a Big Eight accounting firm, Arthur Andersen & Co., participated in back-dating loan documents and that the Washington officials even agreed in one document not to prosecute Lincoln over certain infractions. 
08/wsj_0840:The hearing may also add to the unease of Sens.
08/wsj_0840:Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) and Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), who are being scrutinized for intervening on behalf of Lincoln, a unit of American Continental Corp., Phoenix, Ariz.
08/wsj_0840:The officials said Sen. DeConcini and an aide to Sen. Cranston called California state thrift officials to press for a sale of Lincoln, instead of its seizure. 
08/wsj_0840:According to a government memo, regulators who took control of the thrift in August discovered that a phone line in Lincoln's headquarters in Irvine, Calif., had been "compromised" to allow calls to be monitored on other extensions.
08/wsj_0840:It didn't say who was monitoring the calls, but said the matter was turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
08/wsj_0840:A Lincoln spokesman said its management "never authorized or participated in any bugging of anyone." 
08/wsj_0840:They also accused Mr. Wall of holding improper meetings with Lincoln officials, while refusing to listen to field examiners. 
08/wsj_0840:Members of the Banking Committee generally received the regional officials as bureaucratic heroes and sharply criticized their Washington bosses, who had relieved them of their responsibility for Lincoln two years before the thrift's parent filed for bankruptcy-law protection. 
08/wsj_0840:Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) said Mr. Wall "willingly cut the legs out from under his regulatory troops in the middle of the battle," and renewed his call for Mr. Wall to step aside.
08/wsj_0840:Mr. Wall is scheduled to testify Nov. 7, and his agency said that all sides of the issue should be heard before drawing conclusions.
08/wsj_0840:Separately, other Washington thrift officials disputed the regional examiners' statement that they had called specifically for the seizure of Lincoln in 1987, saying that it was only one option they presented. 
08/wsj_0840:Over two years, until April 1986, $1 billion in loans were approved, even though Lincoln had no written loan standards, said Mike Patriarca, acting principal supervisory agent with the Office of Thrift Supervision.
08/wsj_0840:He said that "memorialization of underwriting activities that had been undertaken at an earlier time" did occur, but that Lincoln believed it adhered to lending standards superior to the industry average. 
08/wsj_0840:A spokesman for Arthur Andersen denied any improprieties, adding, "At the request of our then-client, we provided staff personnel to work for a limited period of time under the direction of client personnel to assist them in organizing certain files." 
08/wsj_0840:The officials said both calls encouraged a sale of Lincoln to an outside buyer, which Mr. Keating sought, rather than putting it in receivership. 
08/wsj_0841:In particular, the Bush administration will no longer be bound by a controversial legal interpretation put in place last year that could have required notifying dictators in advance of coup plots that might endanger their lives.
08/wsj_0841:The legislation also contains significant compromises that have the effect of giving Mr. Bush more leeway in covert actions.
08/wsj_0841:The panel dropped a plan to require 48-hour notice of covert acts, and it voted to permit the CIA to use a contingency fund to launch covert acts. 
08/wsj_0841:In return, Mr. Bush is sending Congress a letter pledging to notify the committee in advance of nearly all covert acts, but reserving the right to delay notification in some cases until a few days after the operations are launched, and in rare cases, to take longer. 
08/wsj_0842:In 1984, Howard Conant, a director of Valspar Corp., donated to Goodwill Industries Inc. of Chicago an eight-acre site on the city's west side, where Valspar had operated a paint factory.
08/wsj_0842:Only this June, after the state agency made a more complete survey of the site, did Goodwill realize the extent of the problem: The property contains more than 70 storage tanks holding hazardous oily solvents and lead, and the soil is contaminated by similar substances. 
08/wsj_0842:"It's a toxic time bomb," says James D. Wadsworth, president of the Chicago Goodwill, which is independent of sister Goodwills around the country.
08/wsj_0842:Cleaning up the site is expected to cost many millions of dollars.
08/wsj_0842:Paying even a portion of the cleanup costs could bankrupt the charity, which has annual revenue of $6 million, says Russell B. Selman, Goodwill's lawyer.
08/wsj_0842:Goodwill's problem looms as a potential threat to any charity that accepts property gifts in the new age of tough environmental laws.
08/wsj_0842:Under federal and Illinois law, present and past owners of a contaminated site are among those who can be held liable for all cleanup costs, regardless of who caused the problem; regulators generally assign the costs. 
08/wsj_0842:Donating contaminated property allows companies to share the costs of their environmental problems, says Laurence Molloy of Molloy Corp., an environmental management firm in New York.
08/wsj_0842:Charities face a dilemma, because they can't reject gifts of property without significantly reducing their revenue.
08/wsj_0842:Since 1984, non-cash donations, which include real estate, have accounted for 20% of corporate giving, according to the Conference Board, a New York trade group that tracks corporate giving.
08/wsj_0842:In 1983, such donations represented only 11% of corporate giving. 
08/wsj_0842:Still, because of the hazards, many nonprofit organizations are tightening their rules on such gifts.
08/wsj_0842:Since June, the Salvation Army's Eastern division has refused real-estate donations unless the donor first conducts an environmental assessment of the property. "We tend to be very careful," says Carl Schoch, property secretary for the Eastern division. "We're aware an owner might want to get rid of" a hazardous site. 
08/wsj_0842:Last year it went back to a donor eight years after accepting a gift when the conservancy learned of waste on the site.
08/wsj_0842:In 1987 the University of Minnesota spent $100,000 cleaning up toxic waste at a property donated by a local power utility.
08/wsj_0842:Now all property transfers involving the university are scrutinized for potential hazards -- at a base cost of about $20,000 for preliminary research and soil samples -- and scuttled if environmental problems can't be resolved. 
08/wsj_0842:Many nonprofit groups spurn some donations out of fear of potential problems.
08/wsj_0842:The Council on the Environment of New York City, a governmental agency, refused a gift of a site to be used for a children's playground when the council learned an auto repair shop had been located there.
08/wsj_0842:In its suit, Goodwill claims that Valspar, a paint and varnish maker based in Minneapolis, and Mr. Conant haven't met terms of the donation agreement or environmental regulations about property transfers. 
08/wsj_0842:The state of Illinois has sued Goodwill for a share of the cleanup costs at a second site, a former paint factory in Chicago.
08/wsj_0842:Goodwill later sold the site, before, it says, there was any indication of contamination. 
08/wsj_0842:That seems unlikely, though, because "everyone wants an exemption," says David Van Slyke, a lawyer with the enforcement and compliance division of the federal EPA. "But the agency is trying to be equitable.
08/wsj_0843:For a company that sells billions of dollars in military hardware each year, Northrop Corp. is pressing awfully hard to get back a mere $6,250,000. 
08/wsj_0843:The missing funds -- and the way they've been accounted for -- are at the center of a long-running dispute between the Los Angeles aerospace company and a well-connected Korean enterprise called Asia Culture Travel Development Co. 
08/wsj_0843:Since news of Northrop's Korean dealings became public last year, the company has insisted that it sunk the money into a proposed hotel venture in Seoul, losing everything when it was bamboozled by Korean con men.
08/wsj_0843:Now, a document released by the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee alleges that Northrop tried to cover up those purportedly illicit payments by forging signatures, shuffling millions of dollars in and out of banks and even paying hush money to middlemen who threatened to disclose the scam to the authorities. 
08/wsj_0843:Some of the allegations were given to the subcommittee during testimony in August 1988.
08/wsj_0843:But the document -- featuring a passel of new details -- is sure to revive interest in the matter on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers this week are deciding on appropriations for Northrop's most important Pentagon program, the B-2 Stealth bomber.
08/wsj_0843:Asia Culture Travel submitted the document as part of its legal defense to the International Chamber of Commerce, which is arbitrating the case between Asia Culture Travel and Northrop. 
08/wsj_0843:In a May 8 filing to the chamber, though, Northrop stressed its view that "this is not a complex case . . . but is instead a straightforward breach-of-contract dispute." The company added that Asia Culture Travel's "allegations are so contradictory and inconsistent that they provide powerful evidence" that the Koreans "deceived Northrop" by pitching the hotel project. 
08/wsj_0843:Northrop's first contact with the Koreans, this version of the tangled events goes, occurred in the summer of 1983 when Northrop approached Dong Yang Express Co., a bus company that was run by Lee MinHa.
08/wsj_0843:Mr. Park, the pistol-packing owner of a notorious Seoul night spot called the Safari Club, was a member of the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee with easy access to the highest echelons of the Korean government. 
08/wsj_0843:The brief alleges that Northrop, by way of a Honolulu-based consultant named James Shin, proposed the idea of selling to Korea as many as 200 F-20s through Dong Yang Express, which was to receive a 2% commission with a $55 million cap.
08/wsj_0843:As part of the arrangement, the document contends, Northrop was asked to invest in the Sofitel Seoul, "a high-class hotel" that was to be built on the site of a Dong Yang Express garage. 
08/wsj_0843:Though it is typical for American companies to invest in foreign countries in which they want to trade arms, thereby offsetting the cost of currency conversion on its contracts to the overseas government, it was still initially puzzling why Northrop approached a bus company to do it. 
08/wsj_0843:"I first thought it made no sense to offer to an express bus company the distribution of up-to-date fighters," Mr. Lee told public prosecutors in Seoul who have also investigated the situation, according to the document. "But later I learned that it was not Dong Yang Express but Mr. Park Chong Kyu that Northrop aimed to contact." 
08/wsj_0843:Promotional materials touting Asia Culture Travel were delivered to Northrop and appear to have been signed by Kang Oh-Hyun, an official of the firm; in fact, the filing alleges, they were forged by Mr. Shin, the Northrop consultant.
08/wsj_0843:The brief says other procedural forms relating to the joint venture appear to have been signed by four Asia Culture Travel shareholders when Mr. Park came to Los Angeles in the summer of 1984 for the Olympic Games.
08/wsj_0843:But three of the holders, the filing says, weren't in California at the time. 
08/wsj_0843:Shortly thereafter another F-20 crashed in Canada during a demonstration, and Northrop eventually gave up on the F-20 program after out-of-pocket expenditures of more than $1 billion.
08/wsj_0843:Mr. Park died of cancer in 1985. 
08/wsj_0843:That money, investigators for the House subcommittee said, was in turn designed to be handed back to Northrop to help it account for more than half of the missing $6,250,000.
08/wsj_0843:Of the remainder, the filing maintains, $1,750,000 could be chalked up to expenses and $1 million was available through a Park bank account. 
08/wsj_0843:The company is asking the International Chamber of Commerce to order Asia Culture Travel and its associates to return the $6,250,000, plus interest "at the highest lawful rate." 
08/wsj_0844:In a response to the commission, Belo, owner of the Dallas Morning News, WFAA-TV in Dallas and other TV stations, said that the Times Herald's complaint is "without merit" and is an effort to gain leverage in a legal battle. 
08/wsj_0844:As part of the agreement, Universal moved 26 features, including "Doonesbury," "The Far Side" and Dear Abby, to the Morning News from the Times Herald. 
08/wsj_0845:Arnold C. Pohs was officially named president and chief executive officer of Cellular Inc., a provider of management, financing and operating services to cellular-telephone systems. 
08/wsj_0845:Cellular said Robert J. Lunday Jr., its chairman and another founder, resigned from the company's board to pursue the sale of his telephone company, Big Sandy Telecommunications Inc.
08/wsj_0846:While awaiting Bank of England permission to pass the 15% mark, Indosuez said, it has agreed to purchase immediately a 10.5% share in the bank for 410 pence ($6.62) a share, bringing its stake to 14.9%.
08/wsj_0846:In a telephone interview, Morgan Grenfell Chairman John Craven said the Indosuez holding "wasn't one that was taken at our initiative," adding that Morgan Grenfell "remains perfectly confident in the future of our business as an independent entity." 
08/wsj_0846:Mr. Craven added he held "important discussions" yesterday with Indosuez officials about the possible benefits of a combination, and that Morgan Grenfell's attitude "is entirely objective." He added: "My understanding of what I have heard is that their intentions are very long term.
08/wsj_0846:In a statement, Morgan Grenfell said it now seeks further clarification of Indosuez's intentions. 
08/wsj_0846:Mr. Jeancourt-Galignani refused to say whether Indosuez will bid for all of Morgan Grenfell when its year is up.
08/wsj_0846:If it does, the operation would be one of the largest foreign purchases of a U.K merchant bank.
08/wsj_0846:It would catapult Indosuez from the position of a marginal London player, with strong Asian and Middle Eastern activities, to the upper levels of the U.K. merchant banking scene.
08/wsj_0846:It is part of Indosuez's overall plan of building its business across Europe, as the 1992 reduction of European Community market barriers looms. 
08/wsj_0846:It said Deutsche Bank is the largest other holding it knows of. 
08/wsj_0846:"The logic is that Indosuez is a French investment bank with a lot of market activities, but not a lot of fund management," said Romain Burnand, a financial analyst at Paris brokerage Cholet-Dupont & Cie. 
08/wsj_0847:And rumors resurfaced yesterday that RJR's planned $1.48 billion sale of its Del Monte canned foods unit might fall through. 
08/wsj_0847:It has moved its headquarters here from Atlanta, shed about 2,000 employees, sold businesses accounting for nearly a quarter of its $17 billion revenue base, and kicked what is called the "loading" habit, the practice of shipping distributors billions of cigarettes that stuff inventories but are never consumed. 
08/wsj_0847:The results have led analysts to predict that the company's 1989 cash flow will be more than 20% ahead of the debt-coverage ratio required by RJR's banks. 
08/wsj_0847:Much of KKR's financing for the RJR buy-out is with so-called payment-in-kind debt, notes that accumulate interest in more notes and don't require cash payments for several years.
08/wsj_0847:Yesterday, prices of RJR's high-yield junk bonds fell on rumors of problems with the Del Monte deal.
08/wsj_0847:Since Oct. 4, the price of RJR's junior bonds has fallen by about 14%. 
08/wsj_0847:In the short term, however, the tobacco unit will continue to throw off more cash because of an estimated $500 million in cost cuts. 
08/wsj_0847:Mr. Greeniaus also says Nabisco, following the lead of competitors, has been "relatively aggressive" in raising prices. 
08/wsj_0847:In June, RJR got $2.5 billion for its European food units, which it used, along with about $200 million of other proceeds, to pay down about $2 billion of a $6 billion bridge loan.
08/wsj_0847:It expects to pay that with roughly $1 billion in sales of assorted small assets (probably including its 20% stake in ESPN, its Butterfinger and Baby Ruth candy bar brands, and its breakfast cereals unit) and $2 billion from the two-part sale of most of Del Monte.
08/wsj_0847:A group led by Merrill Lynch & Co. agreed to acquire Del Monte last month, but the agreement is contingent on the securities firm's ability to finance about $350 million of the purchase price, either by selling junk bonds or making a bridge loan. 
08/wsj_0847:If it doesn't go through, that could force KKR to adjust the terms of the sale or to sell other assets, including RJR's food units in Latin America and New Zealand, the hot-cereals division, or even the Planter's LifeSavers unit, to meet the bank debt pay-down time-table. 
08/wsj_0847:Several people familiar with the agreement said Merrill hasn't told RJR of any decision not to proceed with the purchase.
08/wsj_0847:By next August, RJR must pay the last $1 billion of the bridge loan, with half that amount required to come from more asset sales. 
08/wsj_0847:Predictably, RJR is taking advantage of its improving balance sheet to refinance some of its most expensive debt.
08/wsj_0847:Karl von der Heyden, chief financial officer, said he is talking with bankers about refinancing between $2.5 billion and $3 billion of RJR loans at lower interest rates, possibly securing the refinanced debt with some of RJR's assets. 
08/wsj_0847:But once the bridge loan is paid off, the company will still owe some $19 billion in various types of debt.
08/wsj_0847:And although the company apparently is meeting its cash-interest payments with ease, the clock is ticking on its non-cash notes -- to the tune of about $1.4 billion of accrued interest this year, with the amounts expected to rise to about $2.3 billion in 1993. 
08/wsj_0847:Some time before April 1991, RJR must fix the interest rates on $5.8 billion worth of PIK bonds so the notes trade at par, in accordance with the bonds' terms.
08/wsj_0847:For example, a large, accruing debt to bondholders would diminish RJR's value in an initial public offering of stock. 
08/wsj_0847:As the transaction was originally structured, about one-third of the PIK debt is due to convert into a 25% stake of RJR equity in 1993, unless 90% of the bond holders decide against conversion.
08/wsj_0847:And that, of course, will depend on just how high RJR is forced to fix the interest rate to get the bonds trading up to par. 
08/wsj_0847:Moreover, the $4 billion of PIK debt that isn't convertible into equity could be a big drain on returns if the bonds' interest rates have to be fixed higher. 
08/wsj_0847:"The higher the reset, the greater the share of the return on equity will accrue to bondholders as opposed to equity holders," said Robert Long, a bond analyst with First Boston Corp. 
08/wsj_0848:Sales of electrical devices rose about 19% to 147.874 trillion yen, while sales in the information systems division gained 5.4% to 657.517 trillion yen. 
08/wsj_0849:A. said net income totaled 525 billion lire ($390 million) for the first half of 1989. 
08/wsj_0849:A joint statement issued by the two partners said Enimont rang up revenue of 8.2 trillion lire ($6.09 billion), while gross operating profit amounted to 1.4 trillion lire in the opening half of the year. 
08/wsj_0849:The statement didn't address the issue of a possible change at the top management as Chairman Lorenzo Necci is expected to be appointed chairman of Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, succeeding Franco Reviglio whose term expires in November.
08/wsj_0849:According to local news reports, Gabriele Cagliari, a member of ENI's executive council, is a front runner to take over Mr. Necci's post at Enimont. 
08/wsj_0850:Imperial Chemical Industries PLC , a major British chemicals and pharmaceuticals concern, said pretax profit in the first nine months of the year rose 9% on growth in pharmaceutical sales. 
08/wsj_0851:Peter Kalikow, owner and publisher of the Post, announced that he would discontinue the edition, which he initially started in the hopes of luring upscale readers and retail advertisers that shunned the more sensational tabloid in favor of the New York Times and the Daily News. 
08/wsj_0851:When Rupert Murdoch sold the paper to Mr. Kalikow, it was posting losses of $10 million a year by conservative estimates.
08/wsj_0851:In its first 10 weeks, the Sunday edition alone was estimated to have recorded a deficit of as much as $7 million. 
08/wsj_0851:Mr. Kalikow said the death of the Sunday paper is no indication that the Post itself is in danger of closing down, as some industry observers have speculated.
08/wsj_0851:Mr. Kalikow blamed the demise of the Sunday Post on the soft ad market in the New York area and on low circulation. "The economics just aren't there," he said. 
08/wsj_0851:While there has been a wave of new Sunday newspapers launched in small to medium-sized cities in the last decade, the Post was by far the largest newspaper to launch a Sunday edition in years.
08/wsj_0851:While Post executives had expected circulation would reach 500,000, Valerie Salembier, president of the Post, said the Sunday circulation has reached only about 250,000. 
08/wsj_0851:Ms. Salembier said about 30 people in circulation, ad sales and other business departments would lose their jobs. "What we don't know about is the number of layoffs on the editorial side," she said. "The editorial side is more complicated," she added, saying that editorial layoffs will be announced later. 
08/wsj_0851:The paper has been particularly hurt by declines in the level of real estate and retail advertising, and by the fact that the Sunday paper could not attract any coupons from national companies.
08/wsj_0851:The section had shrunk from more than 20 pages to six pages recently as a result of declines in advertising. 
08/wsj_0851:Ms. Salembier said closing the Sunday paper was a "big disappointment" but the right move. "We were losing a lot of money.
08/wsj_0852:Separately, the Dutch electronics group announced it will spin off about 20% of its PolyGram BV recording subsidiary in an international stock offering.
08/wsj_0852:The big earnings improvement reflected extraordinary gains and the accounting impact of subsidiary disposals, as well as restructuring charges, mixed market factors, higher taxes and plunging financing costs and other spending reductions. 
08/wsj_0853:Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., under pressure from the Food and Drug Administration, agreed to recall its generic version of the antibiotic drug Macrodantin from retail shelves, according to FDA officials. 
08/wsj_0853:It was another setback for Bolar, the flagship of the generic drug industry.
08/wsj_0853:Earlier this month, Bolar began recalling its nitrofurantoin macrocrystalline capsules from wholesalers and distributors because of FDA evidence suggesting that the company passed off Macrodantin as its own to obtain FDA approval to market its generic product.
08/wsj_0853:FDA investigators obtained a sample of the Bolar drug from the Canadian lab, according to FDA official Michael Shaffer. "It turned out to be the brand-name product," he said. 
08/wsj_0853:In Copiague, N.Y., Robert Shulman, president of Bolar, and sales director Karen Sattig couldn't be reached for comment. 
08/wsj_0853:The inspector general's office of the Health and Human Services Department already is conducting a criminal investigation of whether Bolar filed "false information" with the FDA in seeking clearance to market at least two generic drugs. 
08/wsj_0853:Meanwhile, the FDA is moving to withdraw its approval of Bolar's nitrofurantoin macrocrystalline capsules, which are used primarily to treat urinary-tract infections.
08/wsj_0853:The brand-name drug is manufactured by Norwich Eaton, a subsidiary of Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble Co. 
08/wsj_0853:Although no health problems are known to have been caused by Bolar's product, the FDA officials said the agency can no longer ensure that it is the equivalent of Macrodantin. 
08/wsj_0854:Ford Motor Co. Ltd., the U.K. unit of Ford Motor Co., said it offered its hourly workers a 15% raise in wages over two years as a first offer in contract talks. 
08/wsj_0854:But Charlie Whelan, an official of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, said the offer was rejected by union leaders as "totally unacceptable." 
08/wsj_0854:The Ford wage settlement will be watched closely as a barometer of wage inflation in the U.K.
08/wsj_0854:They recently rejected Vauxhall Motors Ltd. 's offer of a 9.1% raise, made as part of a two-year package. 
08/wsj_0855:Only nine ESP contracts traded on the Big Board -- equivalent to about one million shares of stock, with a value of about $45 million. "It was a slow start, but we expected it would be," said Big Board President Richard Grasso. "We were generally pleased with the way the systems acted." 
08/wsj_0855:At the CBOE, 14 baskets traded -- the equivalent of about 500,000 shares with a value of about $24 million.
08/wsj_0855:The CBOE's basket requires a minimum of $1.7 million a trade, compared with a $5 million minimum for the Big Board basket. 
08/wsj_0855:David Hall, vice president at the CBOE, said five to six firms traded the stock basket product, located on the floor of the CBOE near the S&P 500-stock index options pit. 
08/wsj_0856:Meanwhile, the government reported that third-quarter real gross national product, the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's goods and services, rose at an annual rate of 2.5% in the third quarter. 
08/wsj_0856:Although the rate of growth was unchanged from the second quarter, economists said the new GNP report had an ominous tone.
08/wsj_0856:Among other things, the report showed a sharp deterioration in export trade, which had been a major source of strength for the economy. 
08/wsj_0856:As a result, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which meandered for most of the day, ended little changed.
08/wsj_0856:The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco, which have been whipsawed in recent months for a variety of reasons, fell sharply yesterday on rumors of possible problems with RJR's pending $1.48 billion sale of its Del Monte canned foods unit to a group led by Merrill Lynch & Co. However, late yesterday, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch said the planned sale is on track. 
08/wsj_0856:Proceeds from the Del Monte sale would account for a portion of the $5 billion worth of bank debt RJR had planned to repay by Feb. 9.
08/wsj_0856:Traders said the bonds appear to be coming from a range of investors, with commercial banks among the leading sellers.
08/wsj_0856:Municipal market participants also remain concerned that property and casualty insurers may be forced to lighten their tax-exempt holdings as a result of claims stemming from Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake. 
08/wsj_0856:The Treasury market could get an unexpected $17 billion of new supply next week. 
08/wsj_0856:Late yesterday, a Treasury official said the department may take the unprecedented step of borrowing $17 billion to avoid default on certain obligations unless Congress assures by 1 p.m. EDT today that it will raise the debt limit, according to Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. 
08/wsj_0856:Separately, the $4.52 billion of Resolution Funding Corp. bonds sold Wednesday were quoted late yesterday at 99 19/32, down 1/8 from the auction average. 
08/wsj_0856:Much of the Refcorp issue was purchased by four large securities firms that had planned to repackage the bonds.
08/wsj_0856:The yield spread of the Ginnie Mae 9% issue over the 10-year Treasury note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.45. 
08/wsj_0856:In other matters, Maryland National Bank, a unit of Baltimore-based MNC Financial Inc., became the first commercial bank to issue securities backed by home-equity lines of credit.
08/wsj_0856:But later, after trading had basically ended, the pound declined sharply on the unexpected resignation of Nigel Lawson, Chancellor of the Exchequer. 
08/wsj_0856:Japanese government bonds ended lower after quiet trading, pulled down in part by the sale of 500 billion yen ($3.53 billion) of new one-year bonds.
08/wsj_0856:They were priced at 99.58 to yield 5.163% with a coupon rate of 5.1%. 
08/wsj_0856:Details of New York City's forthcoming bond offering were released yesterday.
08/wsj_0856:As described in the preliminary official statement, the city will offer $729 million of tax-exempt bonds tentatively structured as serial bonds maturing in 1989 to 2008. 
08/wsj_0856:The city also plans to sell $57.8 million of taxable municipal bonds at the same time, possibly maturing in 1994, 2004, 2009 and 2010.
08/wsj_0856:The bulk of the taxable bonds are in the two longest maturities, which are tentatively to total $26.9 million each. 
08/wsj_0856:The subsidiary of Tenneco Inc. offered $150 million of seven-year senior notes priced to yield 9.324%.
08/wsj_0857:The company is scheduled to appear before federal bankruptcy Judge Tina L. Brozman Thursday to ask her to impose a 60-day preliminary injunction on the Office of Thrift Supervision, the enforcement arm of the RTC. Deltacorp hopes within 60 days it will be able to sell the thrift, says its lawyer David M. Friedman, a partner with Gordon Hurwitz Butowsky Weitzen Shalov & Wein in New York. 
08/wsj_0857:The RTC was on the verge of placing Colonial Savings Bank of Roselle, N.J., a subsidiary of Deltacorp, into receivership.
08/wsj_0857:The Office of Thrift Supervision failed to return numerous phone calls. 
08/wsj_0857:That's the conclusion of a study by Daniel Meador, a law professor at the University of Virginia.
08/wsj_0857:Mr. Meador, a former assistant attorney general, criticizes what he calls "inordinate delays" in filling federal judgeships and suggests the creation of a permanent office on judicial nominations within the Justice Department. 
08/wsj_0857:Federal judges in Washington, D.C., and other areas complained recently that long-standing vacancies have contributed to mounting backlogs of cases.
08/wsj_0857:Mr. Meador, whose study appears in the fall issue of the University of Virginia's Journal of Law & Politics, writes that "it is not rare for two or more years to pass before the administration sends a nomination to the Senate." His study covers the years 1979 to 1988. 
08/wsj_0857:Under Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, a committee of ten senior Justice Department officials evaluate potential judicial nominees and send recommendations to the White House.
08/wsj_0857:Congressional Democrats have accused Mr. Thornburgh of delaying the nomination process. 
08/wsj_0857:But a spokesman for the the attorney general said the Senate Judiciary Committee contributed to the problem by failing to act on nominations made during the final months of the Reagan administration. 
08/wsj_0857:U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE upholds New York's "Son of Sam" law. 
08/wsj_0857:Simon & Schuster Inc. sued to have the law declared unconstitutional, claiming it restricts publishers' freedom of speech.
08/wsj_0857:The company filed the suit in 1986 after the "Son of Sam" law was applied to "Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family," a best-seller by Nicholas Pileggi.
08/wsj_0857:The book was based on the life of Henry Hill, whom the court refers to as a "career criminal" and who received payments from the publisher in return for his life story. 
08/wsj_0857:But Judge Keenan said, "Although it may be more difficult for publishers and authors to create books with the cooperation of a criminal source {under the "Son of Sam" law}, it is not impossible nor is such cooperation proscribed." The judge added, "The speech itself is not the target of {the state law}; the profit-making aspect is the target." 
08/wsj_0857:The Chicago law firm, the world's largest, will open the first Soviet-accredited office of a foreign law firm in Moscow later this year. 
08/wsj_0857:Coudert Brothers, a New York law firm, and Arnold & Porter and Heron, Burchette, Ruckert & Rothwell, both in Washington, D.C., have had lawyers in the Soviet Union under the auspices of companies' trade offices or in unofficial capacities.
08/wsj_0857:Fifteen joint ventures have already signed on as clients, according to Robert W. Cox, chairman of the firm. 
08/wsj_0857:After nine years in the state judiciary, William R. Quinlan, 49 years old, has joined the Chicago law firm of Phelan, Pope & John as a partner.
08/wsj_0857:He served as a Circuit Court judge in Cook County, Ill., and corporation counsel for the city of Chicago. 
08/wsj_0857:Noting that the Happy Hampster isn't one of its creations, Walt Disney Co. filed a $17 million suit in federal court against Amvest Video Corp., of Rahway, N.J. 
08/wsj_0857:Disney alleges Amvest violated its copyrights at least 170 times in at least 23 video cassettes, some of them full-length Disney movies such as Bambi and Fantasia.
08/wsj_0858:White House advisers formally threaten vetoes of the foreign-aid and child-care bills and informally discuss a possible veto of the defense bill.
08/wsj_0858:Child care could be an especially tough fight; after Bush's veto of abortion funding for rape and incest victims, anti-abortion lawmakers feel extra pressure to show attention to women's concerns. 
08/wsj_0858:To avoid missing Social Security payments, the government must get a raise in its borrowing limit by Nov. 8; the necessity of the measure attracts numerous attempts at adding unrelated measures to it.
08/wsj_0858:Other likely candidates for riders include revision of the Gramm-Rudman law, repeal of catastrophic-illness insurance, child care and other measures that were stripped off the recent budget-reconciliation bill.
08/wsj_0858:Democratic leaders will try to keep them off, fearing that allowing any of them would weaken their argument against capital gains. 
08/wsj_0858:One possibility is more active American recruitment of rebels who would agree to hand Noriega to the U.S. and install the elected leaders he rebuffed.
08/wsj_0858:But Bush's handling of the previous attempt hobbles future efforts.
08/wsj_0858:LAWMAKERS' PATIENCE wears thin over the CFTC's slow pace of reform after the "sting" operation that led to the spring indictments of 46 traders at two Chicago exchanges.
08/wsj_0858:Incredulous senators grill Chairman Wendy Gramm about the fact that 11 of the traders are still handling customer accounts.
08/wsj_0858:THE PENTAGON BALKS at Darman's budget strategy of threatening to make the automatic Gramm-Rudman cuts permanent.
08/wsj_0858:Pentagon brass worry it could mean sharp cutbacks in training, acquisition of spare parts and weapons development. "The impact for us could be appreciably worse than OMB has admitted in its maneuvering with Congress," says a Pentagon budget aide. 
08/wsj_0858:Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan, whose gubernatorial campaign is under pressure from pro-choice forces, pursues a settlement of the current Supreme Court case challenging the state's tough restrictions on abortion clinics.
08/wsj_0858:Abortion-rights activists plan a new series of major marches next month, but their biggest boost would come with a gubernatorial victory in Virginia, where black nominee Wilder is riding the pro-choice issue hard. 
08/wsj_0859:An American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unit, AT&T Nassau Metals Corp., said it was soliciting bids for its Gaston, S.C., and Chandler, Ariz., metal-processing operations, which produce annual revenue of about $400 million. 
08/wsj_0859:An industry analyst, Robert B. Morris III in Goldman, Sachs & Co. 's San Francisco office, said the value of the operations isn't clear because AT&T hasn't disclosed their book value or earnings. 
08/wsj_0859:AT&T Nassau said the operations on the block are no longer "strategic to the core business" of the company, which is telecommunications.
08/wsj_0860:PaineWebber Group Inc. ordered a major pullback from program trading amid mounting pressure on Wall Street from some of its biggest investors. 
08/wsj_0860:Other big brokerage firms also showed signs of retreating from controversial computer-assisted trading, which has become a liability for Wall Street after this month's 190-point, Friday-the-13th plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
08/wsj_0860:Yesterday, Goldman, Sachs & Co. said it will campaign for significant curbs on the most common form of program trading -- stock-index arbitrage.
08/wsj_0860:Program trading, which last month accounted for a record 13.8% of New York Stock Exchange volume, refers to a variety of computer-assisted trading of large amounts of stocks, stock-index futures and options.
08/wsj_0860:Much of the trading is geared to short-term gains caused by brief price swings in volatile markets. 
08/wsj_0860:The criticism came to a head Tuesday when Kemper Corp., a big insurance and financial-services firm, cut off four Wall Street firms that engage in program trading -- Oppenheimer, General Electric Co. 's Kidder, Peabody & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. and Bear, Stearns & Co. -- from getting any more of Kemper's stock-trading business. 
08/wsj_0860:"These firms, by using proprietary index-arbitrage trading techniques, have been competing with their own customers," said Albert H. Elfner III, president of Keystone. "Their actions can hurt long-term, fundamentally oriented investors, and have undermined public trust in the fairness of the markets." 
08/wsj_0860:But there's a chance we might," said David Wilson, head of Penn Mutual's $100 million stock portfolio. "We are very upset about what has happened to the stock market.
08/wsj_0860:Donald B. Marron, PaineWebber chairman and chief executive officer, said the firm decided after the close of trading yesterday that it would stop doing index arbitrage for clients.
08/wsj_0860:It already had ceased that form of trading for its own account. 
08/wsj_0860:PaineWebber, the fifth-biggest program trader on the Big Board so far this year, will continue to engage in other forms of program trading besides index arbitrage, and indeed is Wall Street's foremost practitioner of non-arbitrage forms of program trading in terms of volume.
08/wsj_0860:But Mr. Marron said these other forms of program trading, such as using computers to buy or sell a range of stocks but not stock futures, help bring "liquidity" to the market. 
08/wsj_0860:Goldman, which doesn't do index arbitrage for itself but does for customers, is concerned about the fallout. "Our corporate, institutional and individual clients are concerned about what they perceive to be excessive volatility," said Robert E. Mnuchin, senior partner in charge of Goldman's equity trading. "We share their concern.
08/wsj_0860:Consequently, we will recommend {to regulators} significant curbs on electronic access for waves of stocks which add volatility to the markets." He declined to comment further. 
08/wsj_0860:Yet some officials at a regular management meeting Wednesday night urged the firm's leaders to pull out of the practice completely, to appease small investors. "The question was: Do we get mileage out of not doing it for clients?" said a Shearson official.
08/wsj_0860:For the time being, James Wiess, an associate of Mr. Liptak's, "is now our index arbitrager," said the spokesman. 
08/wsj_0860:At Kidder Peabody, for example, the firm's leaders staunchly defend its aggressive use of index arbitrage for both Kidder's own account and for customers.
08/wsj_0860:Said Charles V. Sheehan, Kidder's managing director in charge of retail business: "To try to talk to {stockbrokers} about the virtues of program trading is like trying to talk about the virtues of nuclear power to the Audubon Society." He conceded "there is a little bit of a conflict there" between Kidder's active program trading and its wooing of individual investors. 
08/wsj_0860:When Kemper cut off four program-trading Wall Street firms from getting any of the big insurance and financial company's trading business, it complained that the Big Board has "vested interests" in its big member securities firms that engage in program trading. 
08/wsj_0860:Average monthly program trading volume for 1989 through September, in millions of shares 
08/wsj_0861:National Medical Enterprises Inc., Los Angeles, said the completion of the spinoff of its long-term care operations will be delayed until early next year because of regulatory complexities. 
08/wsj_0862:In London, ICI, which is part of the Financial Times 100-share index, said its pretax profit for the quarter dropped 12%, significantly worse than market expectations.
08/wsj_0862:Its profit for the first nine months of the year rose only 9%, also short of market expectations. 
08/wsj_0862:The index closed at its intraday low of 2129.4, down 32.5 points. 
08/wsj_0862:"ICI is a bellwether of U.K. corporate profitability," a senior dealer with Warburg Securities said. "Its results were disappointing.
08/wsj_0862:ICI finished 73 pence a share lower at #10.97 ($17.70) on turnover of 3.4 million shares. 
08/wsj_0862:The Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was up 25.01 at 2697.58.
08/wsj_0862:On Thursday, the market opened in a bullish mood with participation from institutional investors, who had refrained from active trading in the past couple of months. 
08/wsj_0862:Market observers attributed improved sentiment to the recent stability of the dollar, which offset expectations that the U.S. currency might surge above the 145-150 yen level. 
08/wsj_0862:Export shares were spurned because of continuing uncertainty on Wall Street, said Shin Tokoi, deputy general manager of Japanese equities at County Natwest Securities, Japan. 
08/wsj_0862:The disclosure late Wednesday came as Deutsche Bank announced the issue of 1.2 million new shares for placement in the Tokyo market. 
08/wsj_0862:Traders said the late decline points to a deep sense of unease in the market. 
08/wsj_0862:But other traders said there are good buying opportunities at the lower levels because the market should soon pull out of its slump.
08/wsj_0862:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
08/wsj_0863:Paramount Pictures Corp., New York, named Arthur Cohen, executive vice president of advertising at Revlon Inc., as the new president of marketing for its motion picture group. 
08/wsj_0863:A few years ago, for example, Coca-Cola Co., which owns 49% of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., sent one of its soft drink marketing executives, Peter Sealey, to run marketing at the studio.
08/wsj_0863:Mr. Sealey didn't stay long, however, leaving after a series of management changes.
08/wsj_0863:Columbia is in the process of being acquired by Sony Corp. 
08/wsj_0863:Mr. Cohen fills a post vacated earlier this year by Sidney Ganis when Mr. Ganis and Paramount's head of distribution, Barry London, were named co-presidents of the motion picture group.
08/wsj_0863:Paramount Pictures is a unit of Paramount Communications Inc. 
08/wsj_0863:Prior to joining Revlon in 1986, Mr. Cohen held a number of marketing and advertising posts.
08/wsj_0863:From 1982 to 1985, he was president of the ill-fated Tele1st venture of the ABC Video Enterprises unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. Tele1st attempted to sell movies via a service that enabled subscribers with videocassette recorders to tape movies delivered on a special scrambled channel overnight. 
08/wsj_0864:New Hampshire Yankee Co., operator of the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power facility, said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission fined it $50,000 in connection with improper procedures in shutting down the plant during low-power testing last June. 
08/wsj_0864:Edward A. Brown, president of New Hampshire Yankee, said it accepts the decision and will pay the fine.
08/wsj_0864:He noted that the NRC called the event an "aberration" and never questioned the safety of the plant. 
08/wsj_0864:In June, the plant's No. 2 executive, George Thomas, was fired because of improper control-room procedures at the plant before the shutdown. 
08/wsj_0864:New Hampshire Yankee is 35.6%-owned by Public Service Co. of New Hampshire. 
08/wsj_0865:The carrier, a unit of BIA-COR Holding Inc., sought Chapter 11 protection Sept. 28, a day after it abruptly canceled flights and laid off 2,800 employees.
08/wsj_0865:Braniff, which had launched ambitious expansion plans over the past year, blamed its difficulties on the collapse of expected financing. 
08/wsj_0865:The carrier sought Chapter 11 protection in 1982, emerging with new owners -- the Pritzker family -- who sold it in 1988 to a group of real estate investors. 
08/wsj_0866:Michael B. Jager, a construction industry consultant, was elected a director of this natural gas utility and its savings and loan subsidiary, PriMerit Bank.
08/wsj_0867:Rio Algom, a Toronto-based mining concern, said the transaction is subject to a comprehensive review of the Dallas-based company's business and the signing of a definitive agreement. 
08/wsj_0867:Uranium Resources earlier this month said it had signed a non-binding letter of intent for the acquisition of all of its shares but didn't identify the proposed purchaser.
08/wsj_0867:Separately, Rio Algom said it agreed to pay Whittaker Corp. of Los Angeles $30 million to acquire Whittaker Metals, a metals distribution business with four facilities in the Southwest region. 
08/wsj_0868:Brunswick Corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $103.1 million, or $1.17 a share, reflecting a $100 million pretax charge due to the restructuring of its marine products group. 
08/wsj_0868:Brunswick said a 28% decline in its marine sales during the quarter reflected the continued industrywide decline in domestic retail sales of marine products.
08/wsj_0868:The company said the charge, which amounts to $79.2 million after taxes, reflects the write-off of certain assets and the estimated costs associated with the reorganization.
08/wsj_0868:For the nine months, Brunswick had a loss of $65.4 million, or 74 cents a share, compared with net income of $176.1 million, or $2 a share.
08/wsj_0869:After more than a year of losing accounts and watching its reputation slide, Ogilvy & Mather's New York office hired away a top creative executive from flashy Chiat/Day/Mojo as its creative head. 
08/wsj_0869:Ogilvy, a unit of London-based WPP Group, named Bill Hamilton, 47, to the top creative post in New York.
08/wsj_0869:Mr. Hamilton had been an executive vice president and creative head of Chiat/Day's New York office, known for its funky work for Arrow shirts, Nynex yellow pages and Anne Klein II.
08/wsj_0869:Chiat/Day said Lee Clow, the agency's president and chief creative director, will fill in as acting New York creative director until the naming of Mr. Hamilton's successor -- or possibly successors -- within the next few weeks. 
08/wsj_0869:Just a few months ago, Maxwell House yanked its $50 million account from the office, following the loss last year of the $40 million Hallmark account.
08/wsj_0869:The office has won just a single piece of new business -- and a tiny one, at that -- this year, and new business wins weren't substantial last year, either. 
08/wsj_0869:The New York office is just one of many Ogilvy outposts, plenty of which are performing well.
08/wsj_0869:And while it has won praise for some of its creative work, especially for American Express, it hasn't been able to attract substantial new business.
08/wsj_0869:But they questioned whether there might be a culture clash between buttoned-up Ogilvy and Mr. Hamilton, an 11-year veteran of Chiat/Day's freewheeling, no-walls-no-doors culture.
08/wsj_0869:But in an interview, Mr. Hamilton said a culture clash "is part of the agenda.
08/wsj_0869:I think they want some infusion of a different attitude about how you go about communicating the advantages of a certain client." He added, "A certain amount of chaos is very good in agencies." And he said he hopes within three months to be "playing football in the halls at 5:30 in the afternoon." 
08/wsj_0869:Mr. Hamilton talked broadly of some of the changes he'd like to make at Ogilvy.
08/wsj_0869:Chiat/Day is one of the few American agencies to successfully use British account planning -- a method Ogilvy attempted briefly and largely unsuccessfully, and which Mr. Hamilton hopes to ultimately bring with him.
08/wsj_0869:Mr. Hamilton accepted the job after repeated discussions not just with Mr. Lesser, but with WPP Group's chief executive officer, Martin Sorrell, who has taken a hands-on approach with his acquisition. "I probably wouldn't have accepted the job had it not been the combination of Mike {Lesser} and Martin," he said. 
08/wsj_0869:Most of the wags and the pundits of the world will say it's pretty tough stuff to turn around an agency that's been going in one direction for a long time," he said. "But I don't think it {the issue} is turning it around -- I think it's getting back to where it was 10 or 15 years ago.
08/wsj_0869:There are pockets of brilliance there now." 
08/wsj_0869:Margeotes, whose clients include Godiva and Maccabee beer, has had a string of new business wins.
08/wsj_0869:It recently picked up the ad accounts for Haagen-Dazs, Newsday and for a number of jewelry lines from Crystal Brands. 
08/wsj_0869:Dick O'Connor, chairman and chief executive of Lintas:Campbell-Ewald, said the office isn't growing as expected. 
08/wsj_0870:Heating oil futures prices fell sharply after some market players moved to reduce their exposure to the vagaries of weather. 
08/wsj_0870:The selling pushed November heating oil futures contracts 1.2 cents a gallon lower to 57.24 cents, one of the most sizable moves in either direction during the past several trading sessions.
08/wsj_0870:Petroleum futures prices had been caught in a tug-of-war, pulled in one direction by continuing strong demand and in the opposite direction by continuing high output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
08/wsj_0870:Even reports of a Persian Gulf incident between former war foes Iran and Iraq failed to shake crude's doldrums.
08/wsj_0870:Shipping industry sources said two Iranian gunboats attacked an Iraqi tugboat near an Iraq offshore oil terminal in the northern part of the gulf.
08/wsj_0870:One broker said the markets might have been more bullish had a tanker been refused access to Valdez, the terminal port for the Alaskan pipeline and site last spring of the biggest oil spill in U.S. waters. 
08/wsj_0870:GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: The prices of wheat futures contracts dipped amid reports of beneficial rain in the winter wheat growing regions of Argentina and forecasts for widespread rain this weekend in the U.S. in winter wheat states such as Kansas and Oklahoma, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago.
08/wsj_0870:The prices of corn futures contracts rose slightly. 
08/wsj_0870:PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices jumped to life, bestirred by a highly volatile stock market and the resignation of a key figure in the Conservative government of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
08/wsj_0870:Market analysts said that continued declines and volatility in the stock market contributed generally to enhanced investor interest in precious metals, but that the British political news was the main factor boosting prices: Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson resigned.
08/wsj_0870:With the metals markets closed in London when the news was announced, a lot of U.K. buying came to the U.S., said Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser for Josephthal & Co. in New York.
08/wsj_0870:William O'Neill, research director of Elders Futures Inc., said that if December gold can close above $375 for two consecutive days, he would regard that as a bullish sign.
08/wsj_0870:The two countries are major producers of precious metals.
08/wsj_0870:He believes the next area of technical support is at the $1.10 level.
08/wsj_0870:The contract's low point yesterday, $956, was both a life-of-contract low and a 14-year low price for cocoa.
08/wsj_0870:Bert Ruiz, soft commodity specialist at Balfour, Maclaine Futures Inc., said that all week he has seen increasing open interest and declining prices -- an almost certain sign that additional selling of contracts is taking place.
08/wsj_0870:Open interest is the number of outstanding contracts that remain to be settled either by an opposite trade or delivery. "I think trade interests are hedging their physical cocoa with new sales," he said.
08/wsj_0870:Mr. Ruiz said that the producers of cocoa have no choice but to sell their stocks because of their need for hard currencies.
08/wsj_0870:He believes that the major cocoa buyers are well aware of the sad state of the market and are taking advantage of the weakening prices by doing "scale-down buying." That is, they mostly buy just enough cocoa to satisfy their current needs -- a common strategy in a falling market. 
08/wsj_0871:The electronic and printing unit, which has annual sales of about $80 million, is the first unit to be sold under the restructuring. 
08/wsj_0871:The subsidiary produces materials used in printing and in the fabrication of printed circuit boards. 
08/wsj_0873:Chemical Waste Management has turned into one of the market's best-performing stocks by advancing 76% in the past year.
08/wsj_0873:Its reward: a swarm of short sellers. 
08/wsj_0873:What with all the garbage-disposal problems clogging the headlines, it's easy to see why the shares of the nation's largest hazardous-waste concern have zoomed ahead to yesterday's close of a post-split 22 1/8.
08/wsj_0873:But the stock now trades at a dizzying 32 times the latest 12-month earnings for the company, more than double the multiple of the market as a whole. 
08/wsj_0873:That handsome multiple, a badge of success, is also a red flag for the shorts, who like to bet that a stock can't stay hot forever.
08/wsj_0873:Between Sept. 15 and Oct. 13, the New York Stock Exchange says, the total number of Chemical Waste Management shares sold short leaped to 5.3 million from 1.9 million -- the largest increase for any stock on the Big Board. 
08/wsj_0873:The offering will increase the public's stake to 23% and decrease that of the parent company, Waste Management, to 77% from 81%. 
08/wsj_0873:The firm sold much of its Chemical Waste holding earlier this year, government filings show. 
08/wsj_0873:Mr. Levine says he can understand short sellers' motivation. "When they see a stock extend on the end of a long up move, that is often a sign the stock is going to roll over," he says. 
08/wsj_0873:Alliance Capital Management, a unit of Equitable Life Assurance Society, has sold at least 927,000 shares this year.
08/wsj_0873:Kenneth Hackel, a money manager who runs Cash Flow Investors in Fort Lee, N.J., says Chemical Waste is "not my cup of tea." It sells for 38 times operating cash flow, he says, while the typical industrial company sells for only 7.7 times that yardstick. 
08/wsj_0873:It has a superb record of earnings growth and a strong balance sheet.
08/wsj_0873:Shorting because of a high stock price alone is "a recipe for death," said Julian Robertson of Tiger Management in New York. 
08/wsj_0873:Chemical Waste Management is "not our kind of short," said Joe Feshbach, one of the three brothers who run Feshbach Brothers, generally considered the nation's largest short-selling firm.
08/wsj_0873:But Mr. Feshbach thinks other hazardous-waste companies' stocks "could be a fruitful area {for shorting} because a number of companies have reported disappointing earnings" recently.
08/wsj_0873:He said his firm has shorted the shares of one small company, which he wouldn't name. 
08/wsj_0873:She points out that Chemical Waste has about 40% of the hazardous-waste industry's revenue, and that it's hard for new firms to enter the field because of government regulations and neighborhood opposition to hazardous-waste treatment plants. 
08/wsj_0873:Earnings for 1989 will be up about 30%, says Deborah Thielsch of First Boston, compared with 34% growth in 1988.
08/wsj_0874:Costa Rica is nearing an agreement with its creditors on a plan for restructuring $1.8 billion of its commercial debt, a Bank of America executive said. 
08/wsj_0874:Costa Rica is one of several debtor countries trying to buy back some of their loans under a U.S. initiative named after Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. 
08/wsj_0874:"We are reasonably close to an agreement on a Brady-type plan for Costa Rica," said Peter McPherson, Bank of America's executive vice president.
08/wsj_0874:His comments were the first signs of an imminent breakthrough in negotiations between Costa Rica and its commercial lenders. 
08/wsj_0874:Bank of America, which chairs a committee representing Costa Rica's creditors, said the prospective plan would enable the country to buy back about $1 billion of debt at a "substantial discount." The repurchase is to be financed by fresh credits from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and donor governments. 
08/wsj_0875:Assets of the nation's 476 money market funds rose $1.26 billion to $357.49 billion in the week ended Wednesday. 
08/wsj_0875:The Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group, said assets of 236 general-purpose funds rose $300.1 million to $116.91 billion; assets of 96 broker-dealer funds rose $1.72 billion to $155.76 billion; and assets of 144 institutional funds fell $751.4 million to $84.82 billion. 
08/wsj_0875:Most of the money flowed into funds in the broker-dealer category, he said, suggesting that investors liquidated some equity holdings because of recent turbulence in the stock market. 
08/wsj_0875:"By contrast, assets of institutional funds actually declined as money managers, anticipating further easing of yields, moved into direct money-market instruments of slightly longer maturities and intermediate-term bonds," Mr. Dreyer said. 
08/wsj_0876:A study of patients in eight Public Health Service hospitals found that cancer-related deaths among seamen were significantly higher than among other patients. 
08/wsj_0876:The study was prompted by a previous finding of a similar mortality pattern among American merchant seamen who died in that hospital in 1975 and 1976. 
08/wsj_0876:The latest report, the first of several planned, didn't draw any direct link between the cancer death rate among seamen and asbestos used in ships as fire retardants and insulation.
08/wsj_0876:The researchers compared deaths between 1973 and 1978 at the Staten Island hospital with that of the eight public health hospitals for the same period.
08/wsj_0876:The group found that at the Staten Island facility, cancer was the cause of death in 55% of the seamen, compared with 28% among non-seamen; respiratory cancer accounted for one in five deaths among seamen, compared with one in 12 among non-seamen. 
08/wsj_0876:The data collected from the eight other hospitals showed that cancer was responsible for 46% of seamen deaths, compared with 37% among non-seamen.
08/wsj_0876:"The cancer mortality `excess, ' particularly respiratory cancer, is not specific to the Staten Island facility, but is characteristic of the Public Health Service Hospital System as a whole," the report concluded.
08/wsj_0876:The research group was headed by Dr. Howard R. Kelman, chief of health services research at the Staten Island hospital. 
08/wsj_0877:GORBACHEV ANNOUNCED unilateral cuts of nuclear arms in the Baltic region. 
08/wsj_0877:The Kremlin leader unveiled a plan to reduce nuclear weapons in the Baltic Sea, including the scrapping of Moscow's nuclear-armed submarines by 1991.
08/wsj_0877:The plan includes liberalizing the system of prices, breaking up industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned companies out of business. 
08/wsj_0877:In a letter to Prime Minister Thatcher, the chancellor of the exchequer said he was leaving his cabinet post because "the successful conduct of economic policy" wasn't possible so long as Sir Alan Walters remained as her economic adviser.
08/wsj_0877:Sir Geoffrey Howe, deputy prime minister, said in the House of Commons that London's economic and monetary policies would remain "unchanged." 
08/wsj_0877:The aide said Israel and South Africa also are cooperating on the development of a long-range missile.
08/wsj_0877:Bush extended most-favored-nation trade privileges to Hungary, saying it had honored its pledge of political and economic restructuring.
08/wsj_0877:San Francisco Bay area officials urged residents of tent cities in the agricultural community of Watsonville to move to shelters, expressing concern over health and safety dangers from unrefrigerated food and open cooking fires.
08/wsj_0877:The U.N. announced that its high commissioner for refugees, Jean-Pierre Hocke, resigned amid allegations of financial impropriety, mismanagement and favoritism to Western donor nations.
08/wsj_0877:Bush is scheduled to travel to Costa Rica today to participate in the Central American nation's celebration of 100 years of democracy.
08/wsj_0877:The president has ruled out any talks with Nicaragua's Ortega during the two-day gathering, where leaders of 18 nations are expected to discuss regional issues. 
08/wsj_0877:Christian and Moslem forces traded artillery fire across Beirut's sectarian dividing line, the first major breach of an Arab-sponsored cease-fire that began about a month ago.
08/wsj_0877:An Arab League envoy, meanwhile, traveled to Beirut from Damascus to help arrange a meeting of Lebanon's lawmakers to choose a new head of state. 
08/wsj_0878:(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 
08/wsj_0878:REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, or REITs, were the darlings of investors in the 1960s.
08/wsj_0878:These pooled investments in trusts, which drew income from owned properties or from interest on mortgages, were hit by the real estate doldrums of that year.
08/wsj_0878:That year 19 of the 20 biggest losers on the New York Stock Exchange were REITs; as much as 96% of their market value was wiped out. 
08/wsj_0878:In their heyday, after their debut with federal blessing in 1960 as a spur for real-estate investments, they were popular because they had tax-free status if they paid 90% (currently 95%) of their profits to shareholders. 
08/wsj_0878:He predicted that the number of REITs would plunge to 50 from 207.
08/wsj_0879:Avon Products Inc. posted a third-quarter profit of $34.6 million, reversing a year-earlier loss. 
08/wsj_0879:The cosmetics, jewelry and gift products concern had per-share earnings of 46 cents in the latest quarter.
08/wsj_0879:A year earlier, it reported a loss of $405.9 million, or $7.78 a share, due to a one-time $425 million charge for discontinued operations. 
08/wsj_0879:Avon said sales in the direct-selling division dropped 2% as sales of new products, especially gift and jewelry lines, were below expectations.
08/wsj_0879:Earlier this month, Avon said it agreed to sell its Valentino fragrance business and the inventory of its Parfums Stern unit to Italy's Valentino Group for about $12.3 million in cash and notes. 
08/wsj_0879:In the nine months, Avon earned $80.3 million, or 97 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $461.1 million, or $7.20 a share.
08/wsj_0880:Expectations of slow sales and price wars are dimming the outlook for the current quarter. 
08/wsj_0880:GM is seeking to buy up to 15% of Jaguar, marking its first salvo in a looming battle with Ford for control of the British luxury car maker. 
08/wsj_0880:The agency also plans to review its regulation of the long-distance market. 
08/wsj_0880:Regional thrift regulators claimed that phone calls were bugged during the examination of Lincoln S&L and that federal officials delayed Lincoln's seizure until it had become the costliest thrift failure ever. 
08/wsj_0880:Bethlehem Steel agreed to form a joint venture with the world's second-biggest steelmaker, Usinor-Sacilor of France, to modernize part of Bethlehem's ailing BethForge division.

08/wsj_0880:Quantum Chemical suspended its cash dividend in favor of a stock payout.
08/wsj_0881:Maclean Hunter Ltd. said its board approved a shareholder-rights plan that would prevent a suitor from gaining effective control of the company without shareholder approval. 
08/wsj_0881:But it leaves open the possibility of an acquisition of Maclean Hunter without approval by its board. 
08/wsj_0881:Under the plan, holders other than a suitor would be able to buy additional shares at 50% of the market price, if a person or group acquired 10% of Maclean Hunter's Class X voting shares.
08/wsj_0881:The plan wouldn't be triggered if the board approved the acquisition or if the suitor made an offer for all shares outstanding and the offer was approved by 50% of holders, other than the bidder, at a special meeting. 
08/wsj_0881:Ronald Osborne, president and chief executive officer of the publishing, broadcasting and cable-television concern, said the plan is meant to ensure that all shareholders enjoy any takeover premium in the event of an acquisition.
08/wsj_0881:He said he didn't know of any planned takeover moves against the company. 
08/wsj_0881:Mr. Osborne said Maclean Hunter Holdings Ltd., owned by certain directors and subsidiaries of Maclean Hunter, has a voting interest of about 20% in the company; no other holder has as much as 10%. 
08/wsj_0881:The company said holders also will be asked to approve the reclassification of Class X and non-voting Class Y shares into a single class of voting common shares on a one-for-one basis.
08/wsj_0881:It said the market value of Class Y shares had traded at a "significant discount" to Class X shares. 
08/wsj_0882:It is part of a compromise $26 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill for the Transportation Department and highway and airport trust funds that the House is expected to ratify Tuesday. 
08/wsj_0882:The negotiators made only small changes to the Senate-passed plan, which was the product of more than a week of negotiations between senators and Bush administration officials.
08/wsj_0882:Of funding for anti-drug programs, nearly $2.1 billion in spending authority would be offset from other federal funds in order to avoid enlarging the budget deficit. 
08/wsj_0882:More than $1.3 billion of the cuts would come from new defense budget authority, or $797 million in direct spending.
08/wsj_0882:Budget authority measures the level of money appropriated by Congress to fund federal programs, and outlays represent the direct spending that results as these accounts are drawn down. 
08/wsj_0882:That amount represents about 25% of the marijuana available for use in the country, the DEA said. 
08/wsj_0883:A simmering feud between the Thatcher government's two senior economic experts erupted with the abrupt resignation of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, sending shock waves through an already shaken financial community and prompting an emergency cabinet shuffle. 
08/wsj_0883:Sir Geoffrey Howe, deputy prime minister, rushed out a statement in the House of Commons that the government's economic and monetary policies would remain "unchanged." Meanwhile, Sir Alan Walters, Mrs. Thatcher's controversial economic adviser and Mr. Lawson's nemesis, also announced his resignation. 
08/wsj_0883:The two men clashed bitterly over the importance of exchange rates in setting monetary policy and the wisdom of Britain fully joining the European Monetary System, which links together the major currencies in the European Community. 
08/wsj_0883:Though jolted by the surrounding confusion, Mrs. Thatcher emerged in undisputed command of her government's economic program.
08/wsj_0883:From the standpoint of the financial markets, however, the prime minister's positions seem murky -- in large part because she has presided over dueling advisers for the last six months. "I don't know where Thatcher stands," said Paul Horne, an economist with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in Paris. "She's played such a cat-and-mouse game with her advisers." 
08/wsj_0883:Although sometimes arcane economic debates undergirded the Lawson-Walters rift, the 57-year-old Mr. Lawson's surprise departure boiled down to a simple stand of he-goes-or-I-go.
08/wsj_0883:In his letter to Mrs. Thatcher, Mr. Lawson stated: "The successful conduct of economic policy is possible only if there is, and is seen to be, full agreement between the prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer.
08/wsj_0883:With Mr. Lawson out of the cabinet, and Sir Geoffrey in the less-influential job of deputy prime minister, there's little to counter Mrs. Thatcher's innate suspicion of the EC's exchange-rate mechanism.
08/wsj_0883:There, she said that Britain would join the EMS once the EC had completely liberalized restrictions on capital movements and exchange controls, and once Britain's inflation rate had fallen into line with the rest of the EC. Economists expect those conditions to be met in 1990 or 1991. 
08/wsj_0883:Mr. Lawson stated in a House of Commons debate this week that Sir Alan's views "aren't the view of the government." And in a subsequent television interview, he said, "I think it is right that advisers do not talk or write in public." 
08/wsj_0883:The EMS views of Mr. Major, who served as Mr. Lawson's deputy in 1987, aren't fully known.
08/wsj_0883:Speaking in the House of Commons last night, he said of Mr. Lawson, "I was proud to serve in his team and proud that he has been and will remain a good friend." 
08/wsj_0883:To a great extent, the Downing Street blow-up is the result of Mrs. Thatcher's management approach.
08/wsj_0883:Fond of playing her senior advisers off against each other, the prime minister has often allowed rivalries and animosities to bubble up within her cabinet. 
08/wsj_0883:Last summer, when the skirmishing became obvious, Smith Barney's Mr. Horne said that the antipathies were "adding confusion to an already murky situation" in which sterling was becoming an increasingly volatile currency. "I question the strategy of having an alternate economic adviser," he added. 
08/wsj_0884:One of the brokers in question was one of Mr. Monieson's best friends. 
08/wsj_0884:His scheduled character witnesses at the Nov. 6 hearing include: U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who was Merc president under Mr. Monieson; Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive committee, and Robert K. Wilmouth, president of the National Futures Association, an industry-funded regulatory group. 
08/wsj_0884:Noting that GNP processed some nine million trades last year, he says, "Who the (heck) would know what's going on with 50 trades out of nine million?" If he loses at the hearing, Mr. Monieson can appeal to the full panel of CFTC commissioners and then to the federal courts. 
08/wsj_0884:To some, the case shows the fallacy of self-regulation, a concept the futures industry cherishes.
08/wsj_0884:This "enlightened self-interest" is supposed to overcome the built-in conflicts of interest. 
08/wsj_0884:"The problem with self-regulation is always that the regulators are tinged with self-interest," says David Ruder, the just-departed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
08/wsj_0884:In this case, Mr. Ruder says, "it would seem they're acting in two capacities -- that people of that stature would testify in a disciplinary case.
08/wsj_0884:One would counsel the avoidance of an appearance of a conflict." Mr. Ruder adds of Mr. Yeutter: "It seems odd that people in high government positions would intervene to testify." 
08/wsj_0884:In an interview in his corner office in the Merc tower, Mr. Monieson contends he is a victim of his own celebrity. "The CFTC was looking for something high-profile," he says. 
08/wsj_0884:In January 1987, he was two weeks away from the sale of his firm for as much as $40 million.
08/wsj_0884:The Federal Reserve Board, which had to approve GNP's sale to Banque Indosuez, a French bank, learned of the CFTC investigation. 
08/wsj_0884:A distressed Mr. Monieson called the CFTC, and asked its two top lawyers no fewer than five times to divulge confidential details of its probe into GNP.
08/wsj_0884:They refused, even after Mr. Monieson warned that the deal's collapse would become an "international incident" between the U.S. and France, according to a memo one of the lawyers wrote.
08/wsj_0884:Mr. Monieson, 53 years old, wears the expensive clothes of a successful trader but his mannerisms are more those of a preoccupied math professor.
08/wsj_0884:His office is filled with toy pigs to remind him of the fortune he made trading pork bellies.
08/wsj_0884:And behind his desk hangs a more recent sign of success, a futures trader's Picasso: a Leroy Nieman painting, depicting a horse race. 
08/wsj_0884:Mr. Monieson, born on Chicago's North Side, by age five was a faithful reader of the Racing Form, regularly joining his father at the track, he says.
08/wsj_0884:An early offshoot was their computerized tip sheet for harness racing -- cranked out using "the same type of equipment used in important space research and big business," Mr. Monieson told subscribers. 
08/wsj_0884:Programming unexpectedly led him into trading in the early 1970s when a customer, a pork processor, commissioned a computer program on the supply and demand of bacon, but never used the program.
08/wsj_0884:They formed GNP in 1973 not out of any desire to run a futures clearing firm, Mr. Monieson says, but because they were tired of paying brokerage commissions. 
08/wsj_0884:Yet pork bellies still held a fascination for Mr. Monieson, and his trading in that pit would earn him a dubious distinction: the only Merc chairman to be found guilty of committing trading violations while running the exchange. 
08/wsj_0884:Three associates held pork belly positions nearly identical to those of the GNP owners and appeared to be acting at their direction, according to an internal Merc account of the case.
08/wsj_0884:One of the associates was Norman Furlett, a GNP salesman and one of Mr. Monieson's closest friends.
08/wsj_0884:Ira P. Greenspon was in the same line of work, and in October 1985 joined GNP.
08/wsj_0884:According to separate Merc charges against the two men and GNP, which haven't been made public, during the first two months of 1986, accounts they maintained, including one named Horse Trading, had profits of $62,372.95.
08/wsj_0884:Four customer accounts the Merc reviewed had combined losses of $20.988.12 for those months.
08/wsj_0884:Robert L. Sutermeister, a retired trucking company owner in Dayton, Ohio, says he lost nearly all of the $10,000 he sent the brokers.
08/wsj_0884:Larry Margler, a McKinleyville, Ca., engineer, says he lost about $3,000 of the $5,000 he turned over to Mr. Furlett. 
08/wsj_0885:Two New England banks reported substantial third-quarter net losses, reflecting the continuing woes of the region's developers and lenders. 
08/wsj_0885:One Bancorp, Portland, Maine, buffeted by loan write-downs and expanded loss reserves, reported a net loss of $48.5 million, or $5.92 a share.
08/wsj_0885:In the year-earlier period, the bank holding company reported net income of $523,000, or six cents a share. 
08/wsj_0885:Holyoke, Mass.-based Heritage Bancorp, also hurt by the depressed New England real estate market, reported a net loss of $8.9 million, or $1.22 a share, compared with net income of $3 million, or 40 cents a share. 
08/wsj_0885:One Bancorp, which had warned that it planned to take a $49.8 million loan-loss provision in the third quarter, said it expects things to get worse, but more slowly, in the future. "Barring marked and unanticipated declines in real estate values, we expect our growth rates of nonperforming loans to slow," Vincent E. Furey Jr., president and chief executive officer, said. 
08/wsj_0885:After taking write-downs of about $75 million in the last 12 months, he said the company is in position, "to address accelerated disposal of problem assets." 
08/wsj_0885:The third-quarter loss reflected a $49.8 million provision for loan losses and write-downs of $8.5 million on foreclosed real estate.
08/wsj_0885:One Bancorp said its loan-loss reserve of $59.4 million at Sept. 30 was 2.9% of loans outstanding and 35% of $170 million in nonperforming loans.
08/wsj_0885:At June 30, reserves of $52.2 million were 2.4% of loans outstanding and 35% of $150 million in nonperforming loans. 
08/wsj_0885:Nonperforming assets consist of $170 million in nonperforming loans and $25 million in real estate acquired by agreement or foreclosure. 
08/wsj_0885:As a result of the losses, stockholders' equity declined to $76.6 million, or $9.35 a share, at Sept. 30, from $125.1 million, or $15.27 a share, at June 30. 
08/wsj_0885:For the first nine months of 1989, net losses at One Bancorp totaled $74.5 million, or $9.12 a share, compared to net income of $9.7 million, or $1.13 a share, in the year-earlier period. 
08/wsj_0885:Heritage Bancorp said it added $17 million to its loan-loss reserve, making the reserve $24.7 million or 1.6% of total loans and 35% of nonperforming loans.
08/wsj_0885:Nonperforming loans increased from $32.2 million as of June 30, 1988, to $69.6 million as of Sept. 30, 1989. 
08/wsj_0885:Chairman Richard B. Covell said he expects that Heritage will rebound in the fourth quarter and return to a positive mode of operation in 1990. "We are aggressively pursuing workout strategies with respect to nonperforming assets in an effort to resolve these problems as expeditiously as possible, while simultaneously minimizing losses to the company," he said. 
08/wsj_0885:For the nine months, Heritage reported a net loss of $10.9 million, or $1.49 a share, compared to net income of $8.3 million, or $1.12 a share. 
08/wsj_0886:McDonald's Corp., under pressure by environmental groups to stop using polystyrene containers, announced a program here to foster recycling of the plastics at 450 of its New England restaurants. 
08/wsj_0886:The program will include 4% of the company's 11,000 restaurants.
08/wsj_0886:And because many customers won't participate, such as people who drive through, it is likely that less than 2% of the company's plastic containers will be recycled under the program.
08/wsj_0886:The plant in Leominster is the first of five planned by the National Polystyrene Recycling Co., the plastics-industry joint venture.
08/wsj_0886:It was formed earlier this year by Dow Chemical Co., Mobil Corp. and six other concerns in response to concerns about growing amounts of non-biodegradable plastic trash.
08/wsj_0886:Paul Keough , acting regional director for the Environmental Protection Agency in Boston, said, "We hope that other large companies follow McDonald's lead to undertake similar programs." But Amy Perry, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, a Boston offshoot of Ralph Nader's lobbying outfits, argued that the program "just serves to legitimize increasing the use of throwaway plastics.
08/wsj_0886:It would be far better for McDonald's to use durable goods {that could be reused for serving food}, instead of promoting the throwaway society." 
08/wsj_0886:Last year, a network of environmental groups commenced a "McToxics Campaign" to pressure McDonald's to stop using polystyrene.
08/wsj_0886:Concerns about plastic trash also have sparked legislative initiatives, such as one in Berkeley, Calif., to ban polystyrene products as of January.
08/wsj_0886:"Political pressure has been a factor" in the introduction of recycling programs by plastics makers and sellers, conceded Ken Harman, National Polystyrene's acting president and chairman, at the news conference, which was held in a McDonald's restaurant next to Boston's Children's Museum. 
08/wsj_0886:Some of the pressure became evident during the news conference when a McDonald's customer startled company officials by blurting out, "Why do you produce so much trash in the first place?" The customer, Jeff Simpson, a visitor from London, later explained that he was vexed by all the plastic, paper and cardboard that came with the McDonald's breakfast he had just eaten.
08/wsj_0887:The dearth of savings limits the resources available for investment in the future and forces the U.S. to import foreign savings. 
08/wsj_0887:But some economists suggest the politicians' new infatuation with IRAs may be misplaced at a time when Congress and the president aren't taking the more important step of shrinking the federal budget deficit. "If increasing savings is the object," says economist Jane Gravelle of the Congressional Research Service, "a reduction in the deficit would be a more certain and more powerful way of achieving such an end." (The nation's total savings is what's left after substracting government borrowing from household and corporate savings.) 
08/wsj_0887:The differences between the two IRA alternatives involve more than partisan manuevering -- although there's plenty of that. 
08/wsj_0887:The shortcoming of offering immediate rewards for putting money in an IRA, as the Democrats propose, is that it will widen the budget deficit by an estimated $12.5 billion over the next five years. "The big problem is the up-front cost," says Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), chief Republican cheerleader for IRAs. 
08/wsj_0887:The shortcomings of delaying the reward, as Sen. Roth and Sen. Robert Packwood (R., Ore.) propose, is that it may not boost savings much and, if it does, it may widen deficits in the future. "It looks like you haven't given anything away, but five, 10, 20, 40 years later, little bomblets go off," says Henry Aaron, a Brookings Institution economist. 
08/wsj_0887:The Bush administration, which was planning to unveil an IRA proposal of its own next year, was quick to do the same.
08/wsj_0887:As banks and mutual funds advertised heavily, hundreds of billions of dollars flowed into the accounts. 
08/wsj_0887:Economists still disagree on how much was new savings and how much was shifts of existing savings by taxpayers in order to cut their tax bill.
08/wsj_0887:Economist David Wise of Harvard University figures 70% was actually new savings; many prominent economists -- including Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers -- agree that IRAs did result in significant new savings. 
08/wsj_0887:And Robert McIntyre, director of the labor-backed Citizens for Tax Justice and an admirer of the 1986 Tax Reform Act that limited IRAs, goes further. "They don't work," he contends. "They just give people a tax break for savings they would have done anyway." 
08/wsj_0887:Some economists predict any IRA plan will boost savings because brokerage houses, mutual funds and banks will advertise them heavily. "It may well be that saving, like life insurance, is sold, not bought," says Lawrence Summers of Harvard University.
08/wsj_0887:But $5,773 of that would be taxed when withdrawn from the 
08/wsj_0887:Nonetheless, some economists argue that Americans simply won't save unless the government gives them an immediate reward. "This instant gratification overcomes the usual bias against savings," says John Skinner, a University of Virginia economist.
08/wsj_0887:On the other hand, the case for delayed gratification is bolstered by evidence that a surprising number of upper-income Americans still are putting money in IRAs even though the only tax break is deferring tax on the interest the contributions earn. 
08/wsj_0887:The Employee Benefit Research Institute says about 23% of all workers earning more than $50,000 a year made IRA deposits in 1987, down from 56% in 1982 but still nearly one million people. 
08/wsj_0887:Donald Underwood, head of retirement planning for Merrill Lynch & Co., says he was surprised to discover that more money flowed into the firm's IRA accounts in 1988 than in 1987. (A big IRA fan, Mr. Underwood's license plate reads: 
08/wsj_0887:The higher tax rates go in the future, of course, the more valuable the future tax breaks. 
08/wsj_0887:The claim is an echo of the supply-side promise that the 1981 tax cuts that bear Sen. Roth's name would finance themselves through added growth or added savings. 
08/wsj_0888:Telerate Inc., which has rejected an $18-a-share tender offer by Dow Jones & Co. for the 33% of Telerate that Dow Jones doesn't already own, said the two companies began talks yesterday to try to negotiate a friendly transaction. 
08/wsj_0888:However, the talks didn't produce any changes in the $576 million Dow Jones offer, which a committee of Telerate's two independent directors has rejected as inadequate. 
08/wsj_0888:Peter Skinner, vice president and corporate general counsel for Dow Jones, said yesterday's talks took place both on the telephone and in person. "We discussed the bid, but Dow Jones and its board of directors believe the bid is full and fair," Mr. Skinner said.
08/wsj_0888:Telerate disclosed the opening of negotiations in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said that "there can be no assurance that such negotiations will continue or will result in revised terms that will be satisfactory to the special committee." 
08/wsj_0888:The talks followed an effort by Telerate to place a strongly worded advertisement attacking the Dow Jones offer in yesterday's editions of The Wall Street Journal, according to two people familiar with Telerate. 
08/wsj_0888:Soon thereafter, Warren H. Phillips, chairman of Dow Jones, telephoned Neil S. Hirsch, chairman of Telerate.
08/wsj_0888:As a result of the conversations, the people said, Telerate decided not to run the ad yesterday, and Dow Jones agreed to meet with Telerate. 
08/wsj_0888:Mr. Skinner said that Dow Jones executives had been told that the ad would be submitted by Telerate and were advised of its content.
08/wsj_0888:Many of Wall Street's takeover-stock speculators bought relatively large positions in Telerate stock after Dow Jones announced its tender offer on Sept. 21.
08/wsj_0888:The traders are betting Dow Jones will increase its $18-a-share offer in order to acquire full ownership of Telerate, an electronic distributor of financial-market information. 
08/wsj_0888:But the takeover stock traders, who declined to be identified, said they believe it is unrealistic to expect Dow Jones will pay that much, considering it already owns about 67% of Telerate. 
08/wsj_0888:Bruce Thorp, an analyst at Philadelphia-based Provident National Bank, said Dow Jones's tender offer reflects a typical premium for the purchase of a remaining minority stake.
08/wsj_0888:Telerate's proposed ad, headlined "What Now, Dow Jones?" was in the form of a letter to Dow Jones directors. "How can a company of Dow Jones's reputation persist in a coercive attempt to squeeze out the minority shareholders of Telerate at a low-ball price of $18 a share?" the ad asked.
08/wsj_0888:A copy of the ad was obtained from a person familiar with Telerate. 
08/wsj_0888:It was signed by Mr. Hirsch, three other Telerate directors who are employees of Telerate, and two outside directors. 
08/wsj_0888:As evidence of their contention that the current Dow Jones offer is too low, takeover-stock speculators pointed to an SEC filing by Dow Jones disclosing that Dow Jones managers had proposed offering $19 a share for Telerate.
08/wsj_0888:After the Telerate special committee rejected the Dow Jones offer as inadequate, Mr. Phillips of Dow Jones said, "We are proceeding with our $18-a-share offer and continue to believe that the offer is fair to all Telerate stockholders." The offer is scheduled to expire Nov. 3. 
08/wsj_0888:Dow Jones paid between $10 and $15 a share for most of the 63.6 million Telerate shares it owns.
08/wsj_0888:However, Dow Jones paid $28.75 a share for one block of about 10.5 million Telerate shares in September 1987.
08/wsj_0888:That price represented a premium of 16.8% above the then-market price of Telerate shares. 
08/wsj_0889:In a highly unusual move that buys time for Congress to debate a debt-limit increase, the Treasury Department announced it will hold an unscheduled auction of securities next week to raise $17 billion. 
08/wsj_0889:If Congress hasn't enacted a new debt limit by midnight Tuesday, the Treasury will have to suspend all sales of securities, including savings bonds. 
08/wsj_0889:In recent days, the battle has become a game of chicken, and it had raised the prospect that the government might run out of cash next Friday and be unable to mail Social Security checks. 
08/wsj_0889:The Treasury's regular auction of Treasury bills, scheduled to settle on Thursday, is expected to be canceled.
08/wsj_0889:In addition, all sales of savings bonds and special securities issued to state and local governments will cease. 
08/wsj_0889:The details of next week's unusual auction will be announced today. 
08/wsj_0889:Mr. Brady also said that he is "aware of no other realistic measures, other than debt-limit legislation, that could further extend the anticipated date of default." 
08/wsj_0889:This year, the debt-limit debate promises to be particularly intense because of the battle over capital gains.
08/wsj_0889:Their hope is that Democratic leaders in the Senate wouldn't block it for fear of being blamed for the government's default. 
08/wsj_0890:The California Department of Insurance charged Farmers Insurance Exchange and Mid-Century Insurance Co. with discriminating against three groups of automobile insurance customers. 
08/wsj_0890:The department didn't specify how many consumers have been hurt by the alleged discriminatory practices, saying only that they "affect a substantial number of people." The department claims, however, that Farmers and Mid-Century, both members of the Farmers Group of Insurance Cos., are steering customers who might qualify for Farmers policies toward higher-priced Mid-Century policies.
08/wsj_0890:The customers affected are under the age of 25, youths living in households of preferred policyholders and drivers under the age of 50 who seek minimal coverage, the department said. 
08/wsj_0890:Farmers Group of Insurance is a unit of B.A.T Industries PLC. 
08/wsj_0891:Credit Lyonnais S.A. said it agreed to acquire slightly more than 50% of Thomson-CSF Finance S.A. in an asset swap between the two French state-controlled groups. 
08/wsj_0891:The bank said it will acquire the stake in the finance unit of defense and electronics group Thomson-CSF S.A. in exchange for almost 14% of its own capital.
08/wsj_0891:No value was given for the transaction, which will create the sort of financial-industrial tandem common in West Germany and Japan. 
08/wsj_0891:Thomson-CSF Finance, the largest finance unit of any French industrial company, also will gain access to products offered by Credit Lyonnais, France's secondbiggest commercial bank in terms of assets, behind Banque Nationale de Paris. 
08/wsj_0891:The accord will strengthen Credit Lyonnais's corporate financial affairs because of Thomson-CSF Finance's expertise in using hedging and treasury-management products. 
08/wsj_0891:Thomson-CSF Finance posted profit of 1.8 billion francs ($288.9 million) in 1988, an official said.
08/wsj_0891:Credit Lyonnais reported 1988 consolidated profit of 2.06 billion francs after payments to minority interests. 
08/wsj_0891:Thomson common shares and Credit Lyonnais non-voting stock were suspended yesterday before the announcement at their respective Wednesday closing prices of 194.50 francs ($31.22) and 642 francs ($103.05) each.
08/wsj_0892:Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
08/wsj_0896:The University of Toronto said it will drop its objections to the offer by Institut Merieux S.A. to acquire Connaught BioSciences Inc. for 942 million Canadian dollars (US$803.7 million) after reaching a research agreement with the French vaccine manufacturer. 
08/wsj_0896:Under the terms of the accord, similar to an agreement reached last week between the university and Merieux's rival bidders for Connaught, Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp., Merieux agreed to spend 15 million Canadian dollars (US$12.8 million) to fund vaccine-related research in Canada, C$9 million of which would go to the university's research programs. 
08/wsj_0896:"Both of these agreements are good, both add substantial benefits to Canada," he said. "Ciba-Geigy {and Chiron} are offering slightly more investment dollars to Canadian universities and some new products, but Merieux is proposing to build a new biotechnology center." 
08/wsj_0896:"Reaching an agreement is an advantage to both the university and Merieux, both in terms of business and politically, since the university has been quite vocal about the issue of foreign ownership," said Philippe Stoeckel, president of Merieux Institute Inc., Merieux's U.S. subsidiary.

08/wsj_0899:Investors gave an unexpectedly warm welcome to Resolution Funding Corp. 's first auction of 30-year bonds, which helped lift the spirits of the entire bond market. 
08/wsj_0899:It accepted $4.52 billion of the tenders at an average yield of 8.15%, slightly lower than analysts had expected. 
08/wsj_0899:The ratio, which reflects the number of bids received for each bid accepted, is used to gauge investor demand. 
08/wsj_0899:"This was an excellent response to a new security," said Michael E. Basham, deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury. "We were very pleased." 
08/wsj_0899:Traders said the auction was saved by a small number of dealers who bought huge amounts of the bonds. 
08/wsj_0899:Traders said a strong market tone was set early in the day when a bid to buy $1 billion of long-term bonds hit the market.
08/wsj_0899:Bond dealers identified the buyer as Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru International Inc., a Japanese brokerage firm that purchased the bonds on behalf of a client. 
08/wsj_0899:Last Thursday, the firm was said to have purchased close to $2 billion of long-term bonds. 
08/wsj_0899:Joel Kazis, head of government trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said the billion dollar bid "helped to support the market going into the Refcorp auction" and "showed that there are real buyers for long bonds." 
08/wsj_0899:At the Resolution Funding auction, traders said much of the appetite for the new 30-year bonds came from dealers who are "stripping" the bonds and repackaging them as zero-coupon securities. 
08/wsj_0899:Strips are created by separating the interest payment portion of the bond from the principal portion, called the corpus.
08/wsj_0899:Zero-coupon securities pay no interest until maturity, with the return to investors consisting primarily of the bond discount. 
08/wsj_0899:Among the big buyers at yesterday's auction was Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Jack Norris, a Drexel executive vice president, said the firm bought a sizable share of the bonds, but he wouldn't be specific.
08/wsj_0899:He said Drexel intends to strip at least $500 million of the bonds the firm purchased. "We've had very strong strip demand" from institutional investors, he said. 
08/wsj_0899:However, credit market analysts were unable to discern many clues about the future course of monetary policy from the Fed chairman's remarks.
08/wsj_0899:Treasury bonds ended with small gains yesterday, which was better than some economists had expected considering the large amount of new supply that has hit the market this week.
08/wsj_0899:Including yesterday's $4.52 billion of Resolution Funding bonds, the government has sold $30 billion in new securities this week. 
08/wsj_0899:Here are details of yesterday's Resolution Funding auction: 
08/wsj_0899:In the junk bond market, Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. issued $300 million of zero-coupon convertible notes, also known as liquid yield option notes.
08/wsj_0899:The size of the offering was increased from the originally planned $250 million redemption amount. 
08/wsj_0899:In secondary trading, prices of investment grade and high-yield, high-risk junk bonds ended unchanged yesterday. 
08/wsj_0899:Meanwhile, junk bonds of Public Service Co. of New Hampshire surged on news of a bidding war. 
08/wsj_0899:Mortgage securities ended 2/32 to 3/32 point higher after giving up early gains of as much as 8/32. 
08/wsj_0899:Bidding for a $223 million sell list and a handful of medium-sized new issues dominated an otherwise uneventful session. 
08/wsj_0899:The 176-item bid list was made up largely of bonds due in eight years or less, with most maturing within five years.
08/wsj_0899:In the new issue arena, underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. set the preliminary pricing for $80 million of Michigan general obligation bonds, the first offering of such debt by the state since 1986.
08/wsj_0899:Another Shearson group had the winning bid for $134.8 million of wastewater system improvement revenue bonds issued by the Trinity River Authority of Texas.
08/wsj_0899:An unsold balance of $22.2 million remained in late order-taking. 
09/wsj_0900:Marsh & McLennan Cos. said it agreed to acquire the rest of Gradmann & Holler, a leading West German insurance brokerage firm in which it has held a 15% stake for 15 years. 
09/wsj_0900:It's also the first major sign of the long-awaited consolidation in the European insurance industry as the European Community Commission moves toward a single market by 1992. 
09/wsj_0900:Analysts speculated that Marsh & McLennan would spend between 250 million marks ($136.4 million) and 350 million marks for the rest of Gradmann & Holler, or roughly 25 to 30 times the private firm's estimated earnings. "This is paying a big price to maintain their virility as the world's leading insurance broker," said Philip Olsen, an analyst at Kitcat & Aitken, a U.K. brokerage firm. 
09/wsj_0900:Earlier this year, New York Life Insurance Co. agreed to acquire Windsor Group Ltd., a first step toward establishing a presence in the European market ahead of 1992.
09/wsj_0900:But most U.S. insurers haven't rushed to change the way they do business in Europe because they believe the European market will still be dominated by a handful of domestic companies. 
09/wsj_0900:Under the proposed combination, Marsh & McLennan would gain a majority stake in Gradmann & Holler that would increase over time to the rest of the remaining 85%.
09/wsj_0900:The three managing general partners would receive a "significant" number of Marsh & McLennan shares, said Walther L. Kiep, a partner who would also join Marsh & McLennan's board. 
09/wsj_0901:Ingalls Shipbuilding Inc., a division of Litton Industries Inc., was given a $15.5 million extension on a contract for shipyard services. 
09/wsj_0902:Furukawa Electric Co. said it plans to increase production of computer memory devices on a large scale in the U.S. and Japan. 
09/wsj_0902:As part of the move, its affiliated U.S. company, International Components Technology Corp., purchased a Mexican plant formerly belonging to KSI Disc Products Inc.
09/wsj_0902:Together with two existing plants in the U.S., Furukawa said it will expand its current local monthly production of memory disks to 1.4 million sheets from 800,000.
09/wsj_0903:PRIMERICA Corp., New York, raised its quarterly 14% to eight cents a share, from seven cents, payable Nov. 24 to stock of record Nov. 6.
09/wsj_0903:The financial services company, which has about 98.8 million shares outstanding, noted its "continued confidence in the ongoing strength of the operations." 
09/wsj_0904:The latest quarter's results, however, included a pretax gain of $13.7 million, or 20 cents a share, in the carrying value of the company's investment in Conner Peripherals Inc. and a $7.6 million gain, or 11 cents a share, from the sale of one million Conner shares. 
09/wsj_0904:Net for the year-earlier nine months also included a gain of $9.7 million, or 15 cents a share, in the carrying value of the Conner investment. 
09/wsj_0904:Michael Swavely, president of Compaq's North America division, attributed the company's third-quarter performance to continued increases in international sales, which accounted for 43% of the company's sales, a 74% increase from a year earlier. 
09/wsj_0904:"Over the next couple of years we would not be surprised to see Europe and international {sales} represent 50% of the company's revenues," he said. 
09/wsj_0904:Mr. Swavely said the new space will allow Compaq to increase the manufacturing capacity of its plant in Erskine, Scotland. 
09/wsj_0905:Wilson H. Taylor, president and chief executive officer of this insurance and financial services concern, was elected to the additional post of chairman.
09/wsj_0906:Diversified, the holding company for Fidelity Federal Savings & Loan Association, said the agreement also gives Star States the option to acquire 588,300 of Diversified's 1,774,326 shares outstanding "under certain circumstances." 
09/wsj_0906:The agreement is subject to regulatory approval and resolution of lawsuits brought by certain Diversified holders in connection with the proposed merger. 
09/wsj_0907:In the year-earlier quarter, the automobile and trucking insurer had earnings of $1.4 million, or 48 cents a share on a restated basis, on revenue of $16.5 million.
09/wsj_0908:The maker of water-treatment chemicals and equipment said it will select the plant site early next year, and production is expected to begin in 1991. 
09/wsj_0909:The former congressman, who resigned as speaker of the House after an investigation of his financial dealings, is ensconced in his district office, maintained by taxpayers on a $200,000 allowance.
09/wsj_0909:One of the hottest tickets on Washington's social calendar this fall was a charity benefit honoring former Congressman Tony Coelho, who landed a million-dollar job on Wall Street after resigning over a controversial junk-bond investment last summer. 
09/wsj_0909:Michael Deaver, the former White House aide, has become the most recent addition to the teeming ranks of fallen politicians and officials earning their way as lobbyists and consultants here.
09/wsj_0909:Surviving scandal has become a rite of political passage at a time when a glut of scandal has blunted this town's sensibility.
09/wsj_0909:Let the president demand strict new ethics rules: With four sitting House members accused of sexual misdeeds, amid the unfolding HUD scandal and after the Wright debacle, "people are slightly dulled by scandal," says political humorist Art Buchwald. "It now takes something really weird to inspire public outrage." 
09/wsj_0909:But many have. "These people bounce back more resiliently than regular people," says Washington writer Suzanne Garment, who is working on a history of post-Watergate scandal. 
09/wsj_0909:Given their own penchant for book writing, it is surprising that none of the masters of scandal survival have yet published a guide to the art.
09/wsj_0909:As if he were still in his old job, Mr. Wright, by resigning with his title instead of being forced from his job, by law enjoys a $120,000 annual office expense allowance, three paid staffers, up to $67,000 for stationery and telephones and continued use of the franking privilege.
09/wsj_0909:There is also a busy schedule of speaking engagements at $10,000 a pop, at tony places including the Yale Political Union. 
09/wsj_0909:On the edge of fashionable Georgetown, in a chic office with a river view and a number of corporate clients whom he won't name, Mr. Deaver is trying to reclaim his reputation as one of the savviest image makers in town. 
09/wsj_0909:There are few mementos of his days as White House deputy chief of staff and confidant of Ronald and Nancy Reagan.
09/wsj_0909:The former $3 million-a-year lobbyist now frequents shelters for the homeless and devotes a third of his time counseling other recovering alcoholics. "I feel better than I ever have in my life," he says. 
09/wsj_0909:One sign of Mr. Deaver's renaissance: an appearance on ABC's "Nightline" for a show on pack journalism.
09/wsj_0909:Host Ted Koppel introduced him as "the media master of the Reagan Administration," with nary a mention of Mr. Deaver's conviction in 1987 on perjury charges. 
09/wsj_0909:He is now in solo law practice in Washington, but his fees have been meager and he failed in efforts to win a chunk of his ex-wife's royalties on her tell-all book.
09/wsj_0909:The aspect of being a mega-lawyer isn't as important." 
09/wsj_0909:Declaring that there was life after Congress, he resigned almost immediately after media reports questioned the propriety of a 1986 junk-bond investment, before any official investigations took hold. 
09/wsj_0909:Among the glitterati who turned out in bipartisan black-tie force to benefit the Coelho Epilepsy Fund last month were Sen. Robert Dole, Rep. Newt Gingrich, and other kingpins of Congress.
09/wsj_0909:From his new, million-dollar-a-year perch on Wall Street as a managing director of Wertheim Schroder & Co., Mr. Coelho reports that many of his former colleagues have contacted him to find out how they, too, can pursue investment banking careers. 
09/wsj_0909:It didn't help when, in 1986, she was charged (and then cleared) on allegations of public drunkenness. 
09/wsj_0909:Mrs. Burford remains bitter over the overwhelming legal expenses involved in clearing her name. "My husband was instantly impoverished by the very act of marrying me," she says. 
09/wsj_0909:No book contracts have been dangled before Deborah Gore Dean, the reigning queen of the HUD scandal.
09/wsj_0909:Donna Rice of Gary Hart fame failed to obtain a book contract and lost her modeling contract for "No Excuses" jeans.
09/wsj_0909:Rita Jenrette, the former wife of Abscam-indicted Rep. John Jenrette, has yet to hit it big in Hollywood, although with roles in such movies as "Zombie Island Massacre" and "Aunt Ida's Bikini Shop," she is doing a lot better than her former husband.
09/wsj_0909:Richard Secord, the retired Air Force general felled in the Iran-Contra scandal, is all but ruined -- forced to sell his Virginia home and pull his kids out of college, according to a recent fund-raising appeal sent out on his behalf.
09/wsj_0909:Yet his co-defendant in the case -- also a former military officer by the name of Oliver North -- has been busily and profitably burnishing his involvement in the affair. 
09/wsj_0909:Even in the wake of Hurricane Hugo 750 people turned out in a remote Virginia town in September for a "family tribute" to Mr. North given by two dozen conservative members of Congress. 
09/wsj_0909:Sex scandals make people look careless and silly, and one of the worst sins in Washington is to be laughed at. "You can be wicked, but not foolish," says Mr. Mankiewicz. 
09/wsj_0909:Nevertheless, Rep. Gerry Studds of Massachusetts was handily re-elected because of the candor with which he handled revelations that he had sex with a male congressional page in 1983. 
09/wsj_0909:John Tower was accused of womanizing and boozing during his unsuccessful bid to win confirmation as secretary of defense earlier this year.
09/wsj_0909:Now he is writing a book, serving on an elite foreign policy advisory board and consulting for an array of corporate clients, including British publishing mogul Robert Maxwell. 
09/wsj_0909:When all else fails, Gucci Gulch -- the fabled halls of the Capitol inhabited by lobbyists and their imported shoes -- offers a welcome environment for fallen officials.
09/wsj_0909:Still, Mr. Mack says he talks to "30 members of Congress a week." Misery Loves Company 
09/wsj_0909:Other scandal survivors are sometimes the best source of solace.
09/wsj_0909:Raymond Donovan, the New Jersey construction executive who was forced to resign as labor secretary and indicted in 1985, only to be acquitted of fraud charges, often calls other scandal-tossed public figures to offer a sympathetic ear.
09/wsj_0909:One of the first people to come to the Deaver home after his troubles erupted was former Nixon aide John Ehrlichman, whom Mr. Deaver scarcely knew. "He reassured me that the hurricane would end," Mr. Deaver recalls. 
09/wsj_0909:Mr. Bauman received an encouraging letter from the recognized master of scandal survival, Richard Nixon.
09/wsj_0910:The Canadian government, with a view to becoming more politically active in Latin America, is expected to announce tomorrow its application to join the Organization of American States, a Washington-based regional agency. 
09/wsj_0910:The expected Canadian move has been welcomed by the Bush administration even though Canada has opposed such U.S. actions as the trade embargo against Cuba, the invasion of Grenada and the military support for Nicaragua's Contra guerrillas. 
09/wsj_0910:The Canadian application is expected to be announced in San Jose, Costa Rica, by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who is attending a centenary celebration of Costa Rican democracy. "Canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the hemisphere," Mr. Mulroney said recently. 
09/wsj_0910:Some Canadian political commentators have opposed Canada's joining what they see as a U.S.-dominated organization. "Canada could do plenty of things to get serious about Latin America without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire" between the U.S. and Latin American members of the OAS, said Jeffrey Simpson, a columnist in Toronto's Globe & Mail newspaper. 
09/wsj_0910:In U.N. General Assembly votes last year, Canada voted the same as the U.S. only 63% of the time.
09/wsj_0910:France voted the same as the U.S. 76% of the time, West Germany 79% and Britain 83%. 
09/wsj_0910:Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a liberal research group, said that Latin American countries would be "profoundly disappointed" if Canada were to follow the U.S. lead in the OAS. "Latin Americans see Canada as a non-interventionist power that respects their sovereignty," he said. 
09/wsj_0910:The OAS, which tries to promote peace and economic development within the Americas, is attempting to find a settlement of the current Panama political crisis.
09/wsj_0911:As a fan of older movies from the 1920s on, I do not find modern comedies contain violence, sex and foul language to any greater degree than other recent movies.
09/wsj_0911:Older movies have plenty of violence, though it is portrayed in keeping with the more restrictive social conventions of the time.
09/wsj_0911:For example, one of my favorite movies is the 1949 British comedy "Kind Hearts and Coronets," in which the entire comedy is based on actor Dennis Price's murdering eight titled relatives (all played by Alec Guinness) because they snubbed his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title.
09/wsj_0911:Similarly, one of the most popular comedy genres of the 1930s and '40s was the "murder mystery/ comedy." The "Thin Man" series of movies, as well as many others, based their entire comedic appeal on the star detectives' witty quips and puns as other characters in the movies were murdered. 
09/wsj_0911:Further, I think Mr. Knight made a poor choice in picking "A Fish Called Wanda" as an example of the deplorable state of modern comedy movies.
09/wsj_0911:The specific scene he mentions in which pet dogs are crushed is somewhat reminiscent of the continual plights that befall the coyote in the old Warner Bros. "Road Runner" cartoons.
09/wsj_0911:There is no slow-motion close-up, blood-and-guts portrayal of the animal's demise.
09/wsj_0911:Keep in mind that this is the same movie in which a character is flattened by a steamroller only to pop right back up and peer in the window of a Boeing 747 -- from the outside -- as it takes off. 
09/wsj_0911:Many modern scriptwriters seem to be incapable of writing drama, or anything else, without foul-mouthed cursing.
09/wsj_0911:In short, we have a movie and television industry that is either incapable or petrified of making a movie unless it carries a PG-13 or R rating.
09/wsj_0911:Hence copious amounts of gratuitous sex, violence and gutter language are included as a crutch.
09/wsj_0911:However, these faults are not the exclusive property of modern comedies, and I believe Mr. Knight errs when he attempts to link this modern phenomenon too closely to a single category of movie making. 
09/wsj_0912:Rochester Telephone Corp. said it agreed to buy Viroqua Telephone Co. of Viroqua, Wis.
09/wsj_0912:Rochester will exchange shares of its common stock for all shares outstanding of Viroqua Telephone, a family-owned company. 
09/wsj_0913:The average unemployment rate in the 15 biggest industrialized democracies was steady in August at the 6.1% rate of the two previous months, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. 
09/wsj_0913:The August rate was 0.6 percentage point lower than in the like month a year earlier, reflecting the pickup of activity in the 15 countries. 
09/wsj_0913:The OECD said that most of the improvement occurred in the second half of last year; since February of this year, unemployment has been steady at around 6.2% of the labor force. 
09/wsj_0914:The Clarksburg, W.Va., producer of gas and oil, said it wants shareholders to approve the split because it would "enhance the marketability" and trading of the stock.
09/wsj_0914:If approved at a shareholder meeting in December, the number of shares outstanding would decrease to five million from 50 million, and par value would rise to 10 cents from a penny. 
09/wsj_0915:Duriron Co. said it has agreed to buy Automax Inc., a Cincinnati maker of control accessories for industrial valves. 
09/wsj_0915:Terms weren't disclosed, but Duriron said the deal will be completed through an exchange of stock. 
09/wsj_0915:Closely held Automax has annual sales of about $10 million.
09/wsj_0915:Duriron, a maker of pumps, valves and other controls, said the acquisition won't impact its 1989 profit. 
09/wsj_0916:Canadian manufacturers recorded a 0.8% decline in August in their backlog of unfilled orders, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said. 
09/wsj_0916:Most of the August decrease was attributed to lower order backlogs in the primary metal and electric and electronics-product industries. 
09/wsj_0916:Manufacturers' shipments rose 0.3% in August following two months of declines.
09/wsj_0917:The remaining 51% of the joint venture will be controlled by Polish lubricants manufacturers, refiners and technical institutes.
09/wsj_0917:Burmah, which has a strong market position supplying marine lubricants and metal-working fluids in Poland, described the joint venture as "fairly small." It didn't provide details of setup costs. 
09/wsj_0918:Du Pont Co. reported that third-quarter profit grew a robust 19% from a year ago on the strength of the company's operations in various chemicals and fibers, and in petroleum. 
09/wsj_0918:Du Pont, unlike companies hurt badly by sharp price declines for basic chemicals and plastics, is benefiting from its broad range of businesses.
09/wsj_0918:The profit gain was made despite a weakening in the housing market, for which the company is a supplier, and a strengthening in the dollar, which lowers the value of overseas earnings when they are translated into dollars. 
09/wsj_0918:The Wilmington, Del., company reported net of $547 million, or $2.36 a share, which was in line with Wall Street estimates.
09/wsj_0918:The dividend increase was Du Pont's second this year, an affirmation of statements by top executives that they intend to increase rewards to shareholders. "We haven't benefited the shareholder as much as we need to," said Edgar Woolard Jr., Du Pont's chairman and chief executive officer, in an interview several months before he entered his current position in April. 
09/wsj_0918:The largest beneficiary will be Seagram Co., which owns about 23% of Du Pont.
09/wsj_0918:A spokesman for Seagram, the Montreal wine and spirits concern controlled by the Bronfman family, said the company will post additional pretax profit of about $33 million a year because of the additional Du Pont dividends. 
09/wsj_0918:He said Du Pont holds about 23% of the world-wide market, the largest single share, at a time when growing uses for the pigment have kept it in tight supply, although others are now adding low-cost production capacity. 
09/wsj_0918:A spokesman said herbicide use in some areas of the U.S. was delayed earlier in the year by heavy rains, thus increasing sales in the third quarter. 
09/wsj_0918:Profit from coal fell to $41 million from $58 million, partly because of a miners' strike.
09/wsj_0918:The increased dividend will be paid Dec. 14 to holders of record Nov. 15.
09/wsj_0918:The stock split, which is subject to holder approval, would be paid on a still unspecified date in January to holders of record Dec. 21. 
09/wsj_0919:American Medical International Inc. was dropped from the health care providers industry group of the Dow Jones Equity Market Index.
09/wsj_0920:The Canadian government plans to auction on Tuesday 750 million Canadian dollars (US$639.9 million) of 9.25% bonds due Dec. 1, 1999, the Finance Department said. 
09/wsj_0920:Proceeds of the issue will be used for general government purposes. 
09/wsj_0921:Nokia said it will gain control over NKF Kabel by buying 51% of the shares in NKF Holding N.V., which owns NKF Kabel. 
09/wsj_0922:"The only response to the challenge being presented to us by the East," Mr. Mitterrand told the European Parliament in Strasbourg yesterday, "is to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of the European Community." Mr. Mitterrand proposed that a conference be convened next fall to write a new treaty for the EC allowing a European central bank, and that the treaty be ratified by 1992.
09/wsj_0922:One basis for linking change in the East and change in the West is the notion that integrating 110 million Eastern Europeans with 320 million Western Europeans is primarily the task of Europeans, despite the U.S.'s obvious strategic and economic interest.
09/wsj_0922:There is likely to be a natural division of labor, says Francois Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, with the U.S. more engaged in strategic issues with the Soviet Union, and Western Europe more involved with specific aid measures for the East. 
09/wsj_0922:The designation at July's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the EC Commission as coordinator of Western aid to Poland and Hungary was a first step.
09/wsj_0922:In part, this division is dictated by economics: West Germany is a net exporter of capital while the U.S. isn't.
09/wsj_0922:"We need a Western Ostpolitik," says John Roper, of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, referring to West Germany's longstanding policy of a diplomatic opening to the East. "For Poland and Hungary we need to think about a stick-and-carrot economic approach that would force them to price things realistically in return for removing all our tariff barriers." He notes that the Marshall Plan of U.S. aid to Europe "didn't just throw money at post-war Europe, it also liberalized and opened up those markets." 
09/wsj_0922:The French analysis goes further. "Most of the West's leaders have finally concluded that we all want perestroika {Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of economic restructuring} to succeed," says Hubert Vedrine, security adviser to Mr. Mitterrand. "But they haven't yet drawn the operational policy conclusions." 
09/wsj_0922:He adds that with communism collapsing and Mr. Gorbachev scrambling to rejuvenate the Soviet economy, "Our interest lies in a controlled transformation, a contained nuclear reaction, so we need to help him, and not just with words." Managing change, he adds, will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the EC, especially in dealing with the question of German reunification. 
09/wsj_0922:Thierry de Montbrial, director of the French Institutue for International Relations in Paris, says it isn't clear what, exactly, West Germany wants.
09/wsj_0922:Any push for a Gorbachev vision of a "common European home," implying the eventual dissolution of the EC, a Soviet-German partnership and the withdrawal of U.S. forces, "would be a very, very serious problem," he says.
09/wsj_0922:He doubts a Bismarckian super state will emerge that would dominate Europe, but warns of "a risk of profound change in the heart of the European Community from a Germany that is too strong, even if democratic." 
09/wsj_0922:He adds: "We, and the rest of the EC have to talk to the Germans, now, frankly and raise these future risks with them." 
09/wsj_0922:While many commentators, particularly French ones, worry that hasty and emotional reaction to the changes in the East might lead to dangerous pressures for a denuclearized Europe or the speeded-up withdrawal of American troops, Mr. Roper in London sees a more positive scenario. "There seems to be a message from Moscow there's a deal on offer," he says. "They want reassurance we won't try to undermine or destroy the Warsaw Pact. . . . In return, the U.K. and France could keep their nuclear weapons.
09/wsj_0923:Kyle Technology Corp. said a Seattle investor has signed a letter of intent to buy the company for about $3.1 million, or $1.20 a share. 
09/wsj_0923:The transaction has been approved by Kyle's board, but requires the approval of the company's shareholders.
09/wsj_0924:Rights attached to the company's common shares were issued that are triggered if a hostile bidder acquires more than 20% of the shares outstanding.
09/wsj_0924:Once triggered, the rights allow holders to buy additional shares at 50% of the then current market price or, at the board's discretion, to receive securities or assets. 
09/wsj_0924:Separately, Dominion Textile posted net income of 4.7 million Canadian dollars ($4 million), or 12 Canadian cents a share, for the fiscal-first quarter ended Sept. 30.
09/wsj_0924:The company had a net loss of C$2.3 million, or 14 Canadian cents a share, a year ago.
09/wsj_0925:Computer Sciences Corp. said it received a U.S. Postal Service contract that will have a value of at least $33 million. 
09/wsj_0925:For its fiscal year ended March 31, Computer Sciences had revenue of $1.3 billion. 
09/wsj_0926:Ohbayashi Corp. agreed to buy E.W. Howell Co., the U.S. subsidiary of Selmer-Sande AS, of Norway, for about $7 million. 
09/wsj_0926:They said Howell is particularly successful there because of its membership cooperation with local unions. 
09/wsj_0927:H. Marshall Schwarz was named chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. Trust Corp., a private-banking firm with assets under management of about $17 billion. 
09/wsj_0927:Mr. Schwarz, 52 years old, will succeed Daniel P. Davison Feb. 1, soon after Mr. Davison reaches the company's mandatory retirement age of 65.
09/wsj_0927:Mr. Schwarz, who is president of U.S. Trust, will be succeeded in that post by Jeffrey S. Maurer, 42, who is executive vice president in charge of the company's asset-management group. 
09/wsj_0927:U.S. Trust, a 136-year-old institution that is one of the earliest high-net worth banks in the U.S., has faced intensifying competition from other firms that have established, and heavily promoted, private-banking businesses of their own.
09/wsj_0927:But Mr. Schwarz welcomes the competition in U.S. Trust's flagship businesses, calling it "flattery." Mr. Schwarz says the competition "broadens the base of opportunity for us." Other firms "are dealing with the masses.
09/wsj_0927:U.S. Trust recently introduced certain mutual-fund products, which allow it to serve customers with minimum deposits of $250,000.
09/wsj_0927:Assets as of Sept. 30 fell to $2.46 billion from about $2.77 billion. "We will have a reasonably flat year this year," Mr. Schwarz says.
09/wsj_0927:U.S. Trust also created a four-member office of the chairman, effective Feb. 1.
09/wsj_0927:Donald M. Roberts, 54, treasurer, and Frederick S. Wonham, 58, who takes responsibility for the funds-service group, were named vice chairmen and will serve in the office of the chairman.
09/wsj_0927:Mr. Roberts continues as treasurer, and Mr. Wonham remains responsible for the offices of comptroller, planning, marketing and general services. 
09/wsj_0927:Mr. Taylor also was named a director, increasing the board to 22, but is not part of the new office of the chairman. 
09/wsj_0928:Sun, a maker of computer workstations, reported sales of $538.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. 29, up 39% from $388.5 million a year earlier.
09/wsj_0928:Earlier this month, the company said it expected to break even for the quarter on sales of $530 million. 
09/wsj_0928:In a statement, Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive officer, said the company's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in April.
09/wsj_0928:One of those new computers, called Sparcstation 1, accounted for nearly half of the 28,000 systems Sun shipped in the quarter, he said.
09/wsj_0928:More than two-thirds of the systems shipped, meanwhile, were products introduced in April. 
09/wsj_0928:But problems in manufacturing, forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for Sun to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer.
09/wsj_0928:Sun also reported a record backlog of orders.
09/wsj_0928:While this indicates continued strong demand for the company's desk-top computers, Sun faces increasing competition from Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. Recently, analysts have said Sun also is vulnerable to competition from International Business Machines Corp., which plans to introduce a group of workstations early next year, and Next Inc. 
09/wsj_0929:C.B. Rogers Jr. was named chief executive officer of this business information concern.
09/wsj_0929:Mr. Rogers, 60 years old, succeeds J.V. White, 64, who will remain chairman and chairman of the executive committee.
09/wsj_0929:Mr. Rogers, who was president and chief operating officer of Equifax, will retain his position as president.
09/wsj_0930:A merchant bank and investment fund have agreed to co-sponsor a reorganization plan to bring Sharon Steel Corp. out of Chapter 11 proceedings and to acquire the company's steel-related assets in a transaction valued at more than $300 million. 
09/wsj_0930:Castle Harlan Inc., a New York merchant bank, and Quantum Fund said they would acquire the assets for a combination of cash and the assumption of certain of Sharon's liabilities.
09/wsj_0930:The balance of the company's assets and liabilities would be transferred to a new company that would be owned by Sharon's creditors.
09/wsj_0930:Quantum said it has agreed to purchase as much as $50 million in equity in the new company, if necessary, for the confirmation of the plan. 
09/wsj_0930:The company had been one of the maninstays of Miami Beach financier Victor Posner's empire.
09/wsj_0930:Mr. Posner resigned as president and chief executive officer of Sharon in April 1988.
09/wsj_0930:The Castle Harlan group includes Walter Sieckman, former chief operating officer of Sharon, and Wolfgang Jansen, former executive vice president. 
09/wsj_0931:But as Congress prepares a fresh package of sanctions against Beijing, the already-tense relationship could get worse. 
09/wsj_0931:The communication Mr. Lee brought represents the softer line the U.S. has been hoping to hear from Chinese officials since the June 4 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. 
09/wsj_0931:Mr. Lee also reported to the president that, in a separate meeting, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin said the Chinese leadership "looked kindly on the students who took part in the demonstrations." Mr. Jiang also pledged that the Chinese Red Cross would publish "very soon" a list of those killed.
09/wsj_0931:Beijing officials have said they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations.
09/wsj_0931:Nor has Beijing hinted to its citizens that it will publish the identities of those killed.
09/wsj_0931:A man gunned down by a stray bullet while cycling to work carries, after his death, the official stigma of "counterrevolutionary," his wife says. 
09/wsj_0931:What's more, much of China's official rhetoric is hostile to the U.S. China frequently lambastes the U.S. Embassy for harboring astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, a political dissident who took refuge there after the massacre. "In the U.S., there are still people who want to crush China and interfere in our internal affairs," Zhu Qizhen, China's new ambassador to the U.S., said as he left for Washington last week. 
09/wsj_0931:Measures already in effect that are expected to be made law include a ban on military sales and exchanges, a suspension of most high-level government contacts and a halt to U.S. trade enhancement programs, such as the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the Trade Development Program. 
09/wsj_0931:Codifying those sanctions could prompt Chinese retaliation. "If the two sides aren't careful, U.S.-China ties could spin downward, out of control," says a U.S. official in Beijing. "Bush and Deng are hoping {that} cooler heads prevail." 
09/wsj_0932:The amount of blood surgical patients can donate and store before surgery can be increased by the new genetically engineered drug, EPO. 
09/wsj_0932:EPO, or erythropoietin, is a protein the human body makes to stimulate the growth of red blood cells.
09/wsj_0932:A genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by Amgen Corp. of Thousand Oaks, Calif., recently has been marketed by the Ortho Pharmaceuticals division of Johnson & Johnson.
09/wsj_0932:A competing version of EPO is being developed by Genetics Institute Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.
09/wsj_0932:A new experiment, reported in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, involved giving injections of Amgen's EPO to 23 patients who wanted to store units of their own blood. 
09/wsj_0932:If tests indicated a low number of red cells, blood wasn't taken. 
09/wsj_0932:The EPO-treated patients donated an average of 5.4 units of blood each compared with only 4.1 units donated by a similar group of surgical patients who received a placebo injection.
09/wsj_0932:The volume of red cells donated by the EPO-treated patients was 41% higher per donor, the research team representing a number of hospitals and blood banks reported. 
09/wsj_0933:(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 
09/wsj_0933:In 1972, then Treasury Secretary George Shultz, with the key support of Sen. Carl Curtis, sought some form of pensions for the uncovered.
09/wsj_0933:That year a four-man group headed by William Lieber in the Legislation and Regulations division of the Office of the Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service, was assigned the task of designing a plan. 
09/wsj_0933:This caused an explosion of IRA promotions by brokers, banks, mutual funds and others.
09/wsj_0933:But in 1986 Congress sharply reduced the number of people who could qualify for its benefits and IRA tax-deductions slowed their roaring growth. 
09/wsj_0934:The Soviet State Bank announced a 90% devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions, in an apparent attempt to curb the nation's rapidly growing black market for hard currency. 
09/wsj_0934:Commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about 0.63 rubles to the dollar.
09/wsj_0934:The current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market.
09/wsj_0934:Even at such rates, black marketeers have been able to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here.
09/wsj_0934:Even a pack of 20 Western cigarettes can fetch 20 rubles or more.
09/wsj_0934:Moscow has already tacitly admitted that the ruble isn't worth much, announcing in August that it will pay Soviet farmers in hard currency for grain and other produce that they grow in excess of state-plan quotas. 
09/wsj_0934:"The absurdity of the official rate should seem obvious to everyone," the afternoon newspaper Izvestia wrote in a brief commentary on the devaluation. 
09/wsj_0934:The State Bank's move is part of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as Moscow moves toward making the ruble convertible -- a goal that Soviet bankers and economists say is still far away.
09/wsj_0934:Rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in Moscow for weeks, but the size of the cut took many Western bankers by surprise. "It's much bigger than we expected," said one German banker, who asked not to be named. 
09/wsj_0934:The next step, which could have a larger effect on businesses, will come early next month, when the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs is to hold its first auction of foreign currency.
09/wsj_0934:Plans for the auction, which was supposed to take place last spring and become a regular event, have been thwarted by a lack of hard currency.
09/wsj_0934:The Kremlin also has been unwilling to provide hard currency for the auction, using a lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer goods. 
09/wsj_0934:If foreign tourists and businesses could sell their currencies freely at the new, better exchange rate, that would enable the State Bank to increase its dollar reserves and would mop up some of the excess rubles in the economy at the same time.
09/wsj_0934:Over the past three years, thousands of people here have made use of looser travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad. 
09/wsj_0935:International Business Machines Corp. made news this summer when it landed an unusual contract to manage all of Eastman Kodak Co. 's data-processing needs.
09/wsj_0935:Kodak yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with Maynard, Mass.-based Digital to manage all of its voice and data communications needs.
09/wsj_0935:The loss is a setback to IBM, which pointed to the Kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration.
09/wsj_0935:A Kodak spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract, which is still in negotiation.
09/wsj_0936:This year is the 75th anniversary of the Federal Reserve System, and some members of Congress think it's time to take a fresh look at the nation's central bank.
09/wsj_0936:The regional Federal Reserve Bank setup, for instance, may be out of date.
09/wsj_0936:In earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give Richmond, Va., a bank and allow Los Angeles only a branch of the San Francisco bank, but times have changed.
09/wsj_0936:Some of the would-be reformers, however, want to restore an arrangement we once had -- or, at least, part of it.
09/wsj_0936:In the beginning, the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the Federal Reserve Board.
09/wsj_0936:He said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and, somehow, he didn't think that was a good thing. 
09/wsj_0936:Nicholas Brady, the incumbent treasury secretary, is of course aware of the proposal, and he doesn't like it much.
09/wsj_0936:That may have pleased the secretary, but H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist of the investment firm of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., suggests that Mr. Brady may figure he already has all the power he needs. 
09/wsj_0936:Like most treasury secretaries, Mr. Brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters, of course.
09/wsj_0936:One of the commission's recommendations was that a single agency, probably the Federal Reserve, should coordinate regulation of all financial markets. 
09/wsj_0936:The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well.
09/wsj_0936:At least some economists, of course, would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis.
09/wsj_0936:The treasury can do something on its own, but to have any hope of success it needs help from the Fed.
09/wsj_0936:In other words, it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market. 
09/wsj_0936:When traders see the Fed is in the exchange market it may make them tread a little carefully, for fear of what the central bank may do.
09/wsj_0936:Earlier this year, Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, argued forcefully that a government that wants steady, stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies.
09/wsj_0937:This has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the Iron Curtain and interesting shifts in official American policy toward Moscow.
09/wsj_0937:In fact, however, Mr. Reagan's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which Americans can actually do something.
09/wsj_0937:Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal. 
09/wsj_0937:Earlier this week, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze confessed that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and, to put it bluntly, "engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty" by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk.
09/wsj_0937:Hungary is no longer a "Socialist Peoples" republic, the Communist Party no longer has automatic delegates in the U.S.S.R.'s Congress of Peoples Deputies and Egon Krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party functionaries when he took over as East Germany's new maximum leader.
09/wsj_0937:All of that is just for starters, or so the hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding. 
09/wsj_0937:Of like, though lesser, note, Secretary of State James Baker put the administration four-square behind perestroika and glasnost, and therefore behind Mikhail Gorbachev, in a pair of carefully reasoned speeches over the past week or so.
09/wsj_0937:And, last but not least, President George Bush now views the changes in Eastern Europe as "absolutely extraordinary" and believes that Mr. Krenz "can't turn the clock back" in East Germany because the change is too inexorable," as he told the New York Times's R.W. Apple Jr. (In other words, after some highly visible dithering and public airing of differences, the administration has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are witnessing from Berlin to Siberia is a good thing to be welcomed, rather than a new thing to be feared or viewed with suspicion.) 
09/wsj_0937:All of this is what history will note, assuming that events don't make it seem a bad joke, when the record of this time is put down.
09/wsj_0937:For journalists, however, who write what they fondly view as history's first draft, this has also been a week to give a lot of space and time to Ron and Nancy's sales appearance in Japan on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder.
09/wsj_0937:It has been a well-paid transaction, this bartering away of the prestige of the republic's highest office.
09/wsj_0937:All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who enjoy wallowing in such things to go into high public dudgeon, as Mr. Apple and I did the other night on ABC's "Nightline." Punching away, we raised what I still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow, but at the end of the affair, there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target.
09/wsj_0937:As one of his defenders so aptly put it, President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election (and some would say thereafter as well).
09/wsj_0937:Primarily because there's more to the matter than Ronald Reagan's personal values, or lack of them.
09/wsj_0937:Selling the presidency for a mess of pottage is not so much a devaluation from the norm of public life today as it is a reflection of the disintegration of public standards.
09/wsj_0937:The theme song for the 1980s has been, "Anything Goes," and it has been whistled with gusto from Wall Street to some of the highest peaks of televangelism. 
09/wsj_0937:There are those who say that this is nothing new, that America has always suffered from a bad case of schizophrenia when it comes to the dichotomy between what is professed and what is practiced.
09/wsj_0937:Eighty-three years ago, William James wrote to H.G. Wells: "The moral flabbiness born of the exclusive worship of the bitch goddess success . . . that, with the squalid cash interpretation put on the word success, is our national disease." 
09/wsj_0937:As a last recourse, when all else has failed and you are pinned, apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong. (See, for instance, Jim Bakker's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this Tuesday for defrauding the faithful.) Consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. Shevardnadze's speech of confession this week and the hang-tough defense of everyone concerned with the Iran-Contra affair.
09/wsj_0937:The Soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government "violated norms of behavior" in Afghanistan and just plain lied about the radar station.
09/wsj_0937:That is the key to the current "national disease." No one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the narrowest construction of the law.
09/wsj_0937:The occasional media witch hunt about some politician's private peccadilloes notwithstanding, the general inclination is to offer a version of the old refrain, "Who am I to judge?" Thus, no standards, no judgment and no values. 
09/wsj_0937:No, we ought to be mad because he has demeaned the office we gave him, enlisting it in the service of private gain, just as we ought to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth, play disingenuous games about their activities or, to steal a phrase, make public service a private trough. 
09/wsj_0937:"I'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this, President Bush told Mr. Apple in this week's interview.
09/wsj_0937:But there is no defense at all for the ethos of the 1980s.
09/wsj_0937:Or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for the United States of 1989: Everything for sale; nothing of real value. 
09/wsj_0938:The board said Mr. Drabinsky and Vice Chairman Myron Gottlieb are negotiating financing before offering C$16.40 a share to acquire all of Cineplex's shares outstanding.
09/wsj_0938:Drabinsky and Gottlieb mail an offer to shareholders by Nov. 22, it will reimburse them a maximum of C$8.5 million for expenses related to a bid. 
09/wsj_0938:"We consider that his bid is an acceptable bid," said Sandra Kolber, spokeswoman for the independent directors' committee appointed last May to solicit and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between Mr. Drabinsky and Cineplex's major shareholder, MCA Inc. 
09/wsj_0938:MCA holds half of Cineplex's equity and 33% of its voting rights through restricted voting shares, while Bronfman interests hold about 24% of the company's equity. 
09/wsj_0938:She declined to identify other bidders but said Mr. Drabinsky's offer "is all cash, and it's for all of the company." Several Cineplex analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointingly low or for only part of the company. 
09/wsj_0938:"All this has really established is that MCA and the Bronfmans have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out," said Jeffery Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon in Los Angeles. "If a bid materializes at that price, shareholders will have every reason to be glad, but the question of financing still remains." 
09/wsj_0938:Last April, Mr. Drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to 30.2% of Cineplex for C$17.50 a share from Bronfman associates.
09/wsj_0938:Mr. Drabinsky, who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years, said the purchase, subsequently rejected by regulators, was aimed at consolidating his control of the company.
09/wsj_0938:The directors didn't indicate the source of financing for Mr. Drabinsky's new proposal, but said MCA and the Bronfman associates agreed in principle to buy for $57 million and then lease back to Cineplex its 18-screen theater complex in Universal City, Calif., if Mr. Drabinsky succeeds in an offer. 
09/wsj_0938:"This is being done at the suggestion of {Mr.
09/wsj_0938:In addition, the directors said if a bid by Mr. Drabinsky is successful, Cineplex expects Rank Organisation PLC to acquire the 51% of Cineplex's Film House unit it doesn't own, and provide Mr. Drabinsky with additional loan financing. 
09/wsj_0939:In April, Hoechst, the largest producer of CFCs in West Germany, said it wanted to reduce production of the product by 50% by 1993. 
09/wsj_0939:This year, Hoechst will produce about 62,000 tons of CFCs in factories in Frankfurt, Spain and Brazil. 
09/wsj_0939:Of Hoechst's 40.9 billion marks in group sales in 1988, 200 million marks came from sales of CFCs. 
09/wsj_0939:Also, BASF AG, another large chemicals company, said it formed a separate division that will study the environmental impact of plastics and will investigate all possibilities of recycling plastics. 
09/wsj_0940:George L. Manzanec, 53 years old, senior vice president of Texas Eastern Corp., was elected a group vice president of this natural-gas-pipeline concern.
09/wsj_0940:All of the companies are units of Panhandle Eastern Corp., which acquired Texas Eastern Corp. earlier this year. 
09/wsj_0941:Adolph Coors Co. said its Coors Brewing Co. unit will test market a new line of bottled water in the West beginning early next year. 
09/wsj_0941:Coors is hoping to become one of the first companies to distribute bottled water nationwide.
09/wsj_0941:Perrier, sold by Perrier Group of America, a unit of Source Perrier S.A. of Paris, and Evian, sold by a U.S. unit BSN of France, are distributed to urban areas nationally, but are less available in rural communities.
09/wsj_0941:The company said it will sell the water plain and with lemon-lime and cherry flavors and will package it in 28-ounce bottles and 6.5 ounce bottles as part of six-packs. 
09/wsj_0941:The test markets, though not specified, will be in northern California, Arizona and Colorado, some of the hottest bottled-water markets. 
09/wsj_0942:Some of America's biggest trading partners gave a quick thumbs-down to a U.S. proposal to liberalize world trade and reduce farm-product subsidies. 
09/wsj_0942:In Geneva, where world trade talks are being held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, the European Community called the U.S. proposal "a step backward." And Japan's minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries told a committee of Japan's parliament that Washington's proposal was impractical and that Tokyo would continue to heavily subsidize its rice farmers. 
09/wsj_0942:EC officials say they are irked that the U.S. has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the "elimination" of export subsides, not just reduction.
09/wsj_0942:Ambassador Katz said the U.S. was open to discussing particular problems of developing countries. 
09/wsj_0942:The new U.S. package also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports.
09/wsj_0942:Seeking to allay European concerns, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said in Washington that the new U.S. plan wouldn't "put farmers out of business" but would encourage them to "grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants." 
09/wsj_0942:The EC, with a population of 320 million, has 8.5 million farmers, while the U.S., with a population of about 245 million, has only two million farmers. 
09/wsj_0943:Bell Atlantic Corp. said it agreed definitively to acquire one of Control Data Corp. 's computer-maintenance businesses.
09/wsj_0943:Terms of the accord weren't disclosed. 
09/wsj_0943:The unit has 6,000 customers and, according to one analyst, had 1988 revenue of about $85 million. 
09/wsj_0943:However, Control Data would continue to provide maintenance services for customers of its Cyber product line. 
09/wsj_0943:The unit represents a small portion of Minneapolis-based Control Data's overall computer-servicing business, which last year posted sales of about $400 million.
09/wsj_0943:Thomas Vassiliades, president of Bell Atlantic's customer services division, said the acquisition would give the company's Sorbus computer-maintenance unit added expertise in "the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies." 
09/wsj_0944:Two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and biography.
09/wsj_0944:Russell Miller's "Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard" is a biography of the founder of the Church of Scientology.
09/wsj_0944:District Court Judge Pierre Leval denied the injunction on the ground that New Era had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time -- the doctrine lawyers call "laches." As for the merits, Judge Leval said that Mr. Miller had written "a serious book of responsible historical criticism." Verbatim quotation, the judge believed, was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about Mr. Hubbard -- mendacity, bigotry, paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of Mr. Hubbard's own words. "The biographer/critic," Judge Leval wrote, "should not be required simply to express . . . conclusions without defending them by example." In such circumstances, free-speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright owner. 
09/wsj_0944:But Judge Leval felt constrained by an earlier decision of the Second Circuit Court forbidding a biographer of J.D. Salinger to quote from Mr. Salinger's personal letters.
09/wsj_0944:He distinguished the two cases: In Salinger, Judge Leval noted, the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather than of proving points about the subject.
09/wsj_0944:Still the Salinger decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials.
09/wsj_0944:Judge Leval reluctantly concluded that a few of Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard's unpublished writings, because they were not necessary to prove historical points, failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright.
09/wsj_0944:In a decision in April of this year, Judge Roger Miner, joined by Judge Frank Altimari, agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that "Bare-Faced Messiah" was a serious work but rejected Judge Leval's argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright. "We conclude," the two judges wrote, "that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction." Had the suit been filed in time, they said, "Bare-Faced Messiah" would have been suppressed. 
09/wsj_0944:Decisions by the Second Circuit itself, Judge Oakes continued, had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the indispensability in particular cases of verbatim quotations are vital components of fair use.
09/wsj_0944:Suppression of the book, Judge Oakes observed, would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the First Amendment. 
09/wsj_0944:Moreover, and here Judge Oakes went to the heart of the question, "Responsible biographers and historians constantly use primary sources, letters, diaries, and memoranda.
09/wsj_0944:Indeed, it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information." 
09/wsj_0944:Now, scholars in fulfilling their responsibility do not claim the right to invade every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation.
09/wsj_0944:And of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers, whether in their own possession or as donated or sold to libraries.
09/wsj_0944:But in the "Bare-Faced Messiah" case the author found most of his material in court records or via the Freedom of Information Act.
09/wsj_0944:And when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials, copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points. 
09/wsj_0944:Judges Oakes and Leval understand the requirements of historical scholarship.
09/wsj_0944:If an author quotes "more than minimal amounts" of unpublished copyrighted materials, as the Salinger decision had it, "he deserves to be enjoined." The courts have not defined "minimal amounts," but publishers, I understand, take it to mean about 50 words.
09/wsj_0944:A second decision, handed down in August by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is another blow against scholarship.
09/wsj_0944:Janet Malcolm, a professional writer on psychiatric matters, wrote a series of articles for the New Yorker, later published in book form by Knopf under the title "In the Freud Archives." The articles were largely based on interviews Ms. Malcolm had taped with Jeffrey Masson, a psychoanalyst who had served as projects director of the Freud Archives. 
09/wsj_0944:As a public figure, Mr. Masson had to prove malice and, as proof of malice, Mr. Masson contended that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by Ms. Malcolm were in fact fabricated.
09/wsj_0944:The quotes could not be found on the tapes, and the two judges who decided the case for Ms. Malcolm and her publishers conceded that, for the purpose of their decision, "we assume the quotations were deliberately altered." 
09/wsj_0944:But Judge Arthur Alarcon, joined by Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall, took the astonishing position that it is perfectly OK to fabricate quotations so long as a judge finds that the fabrications do not alter substantive content or are rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks. 
09/wsj_0944:In his eloquent dissent, Judge Alex Kozinski observed that when a writer uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said, the reader assumes that these are the speaker's precise words or at least his words purged of "uh" and "you know" and grammatical error.
09/wsj_0944:While judges have an obligation under the First Amendment to safeguard freedom of the press, "the right to deliberately alter quotations is not, in my view, a concomitant of a free press." 
09/wsj_0944:The majority cited Mr. Masson's remark "It's me alone . . . against the rest of the analytic world" as warrant for the Malcolm fabrication.
09/wsj_0944:The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of Mr. Masson's description of himself as a "private asset but a public liability" to Anna Freud and that in any case it was not defamatory.
09/wsj_0944:Judge Kozinski found the derivation entirely strained and writes that "for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual gigolo is . . . a devastating admission of professional dishonesty." 
09/wsj_0944:These were only two of a series of fabrications that had, in Judge Kozinski's words, the cumulative effect of making Mr. Masson "appear more arrogant, less sensitive, shallower, more self-aggrandizing, and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements." As Robert Coles wrote in a review of Ms. Malcolm's book, Mr. Masson emerges "as a grandiose egotist . . . and, in the end, a self-destructive fool.
09/wsj_0944:"There is one sacred rule of journalism," John Hersey has said. "The writer must not invent." Should the green light Judges Alarcon and Hall have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice, it will notably reduce the value of journalism for historians -- and for citizens.
09/wsj_0944:Mr. Schlesinger is Albert Schweitzer professor of the humanities at the City University of New York and a winner of Pulitzer Prizes in history and biography. 
09/wsj_0945:Hale Milgrim, 41 years old, senior vice president, marketing at Elecktra Entertainment Inc., was named president of Capitol Records Inc., a unit of this entertainment concern.
09/wsj_0946:Legal controversies in America have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case.
09/wsj_0946:They speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment. 
09/wsj_0946:In the 1920s, a young schoolteacher, John T. Scopes, volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the Tennessee Legislature.
09/wsj_0946:So it was with the Hiss case a generation later, when Alger Hiss became a lightning rod for the anxieties of the Cold War and conflicting attitudes toward the New Deal he had served.
09/wsj_0946:His trials aroused public passions out of all proportion to the rather banal secrets he allegedly had passed to Soviet intelligence. 
09/wsj_0946:And so it seems to be with the case of Elizabeth Morgan, the Washington, D.C., plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter.
09/wsj_0946:Dr. Morgan has just emerged from the D.C. jail after more than two years' confinement for contempt of court, a heroine to her many supporters. 
09/wsj_0946:To the rest of us, the case is a puzzle.
09/wsj_0946:It is what lawyers call "fact intensive." It presents no great issue of legal principle, no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt.
09/wsj_0946:Instead, it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of "who did what to whom." It is difficult, if not impossible, for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy.
09/wsj_0946:So we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has exerted over the minds of many, not just in Washington but elsewhere in the country and even the world.
09/wsj_0946:I suggest that three themes have come together in the strange case of Dr. Morgan. 
09/wsj_0946:The first is that it represents an intense battle in what James Thurber used to caricature as "the war between the sexes." But although Thurber did so gently and lightheartedly, many of Dr. Morgan's supporters have taken Thurber's memorable title "The Male Animal" quite literally.
09/wsj_0946:The vehemence of the emotions aroused by the case testifies to its symbolic importance in the war that Thurber accepted as an eternal part of the human condition. 
09/wsj_0946:A second theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the Morgan case.
09/wsj_0946:Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the "best" schools.
09/wsj_0946:As members of the Black Caucus in Congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed Dr. Morgan, does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated, black, working-class woman, Congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her?
09/wsj_0946:Or that the president would have hurried to sign the bill "out of compassion for her plight"?
09/wsj_0946:Finally, the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government.
09/wsj_0946:The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons, and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same TV newscasts as other people in the area do.
09/wsj_0946:Bashing the D.C. government is risk-free for members of Congress, who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it. 
09/wsj_0946:Congress is paralyzed from acting on such great issues of the day as the federal budget deficit.
09/wsj_0946:Yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single individual passed Congress with almost unimaginable speed, before the judicial process had run its course, and, indeed, while the Morgan case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court. 
09/wsj_0946:The Morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex, class, race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of Dr. Morgan's particular situation.
09/wsj_0947:CRRES is a joint NASA-Air Force satellite to study the effects of space radiation on micro-electronic components. 
09/wsj_0948:Ronald J. Taylor, 48, was named chairman of this insurance firm's reinsurance brokerage group and its major unit, G.L. Hodson & Son Inc. Robert G. Hodson, 65, retired as chairman but will remain a consultant.
09/wsj_0948:Stephen A. Crane, 44, senior vice president and chief financial and planning officer of the parent, was named president and chief executive of the brokerage group and the unit, succeeding Mr. Taylor.
09/wsj_0949:The new suitor, Stevric Equity Ventures Inc., of Mineola, N.Y., characterized its proposal as the "first truly independent offer which does not pit one interest group against another within the Arby's franchisee community." 
09/wsj_0949:In September, DWG, a Miami Beach, Fla., holding company controlled by financeer Victor Posner, rejected an offer from a group of Arby's franchisees to acquire Arby's for $200 million.
09/wsj_0949:Since then, a second group of franchisees has banded together to try to wrestle control of the unit from Mr. Posner.
09/wsj_0949:Stevric's principals, Richard and Steven Buckley, said they led the acquisition group that acquired the Nathan's Famous Inc. restaurant chain and subsequently served as the top officers of the company.
09/wsj_0949:Richard Buckley said Stevric's acquisition of Arby's "would allow seasoned franchisers and food-service operators, with no conflicts of interest, to stabilize franchisee relations and properly refocus the company's energies toward growth." 
09/wsj_0950:Earnings for GM common stock, reflecting the performance of GM's core automotive operations, will be disclosed this morning.
09/wsj_0950:The earnings drop at GM Hughes Electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and GM's North American automotive operations, which are a primary customer for the Delco Electronics Corp. side of the GM Hughes unit. 
09/wsj_0950:Profit at the unit fell to $110.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from $142.4 million, or 45 cents a share, largely because of a $24 million one-time charge associated with Hughes's previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least 6,000 people by year end.
09/wsj_0950:GMAC said its automotive financing and leasing business rose 35% in the U.S., largely because of dealer and customer incentives used to boost sales.
09/wsj_0950:GMAC profits are combined with earnings from the rest of GM's operations and attributed to the company's traditional common stock. 
09/wsj_0950:Revenue from non-GM accounts was 45% of EDS's total business in the latest nine months, compared with 40% a year earlier.
09/wsj_0950:The company has said it wants to boost non-GM revenue to at least 50% of its total business by the end of 1990. 
09/wsj_0951:William C. Ballard Jr., 48 years old, was elected a director of this distilled beverages concern, expanding the board to 11 members. 
09/wsj_0952:Alvin W. Trivelpiece, director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tenn., was elected a director of this optical-products concern.
09/wsj_0953:In the bidding war for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, United Illuminating Co. raised its proposed offer to one it valued at $2.29 billion from $2.19 billion, apparently topping all other bidders. 
09/wsj_0953:The bids remain subject to evaluation by the federal bankruptcy court supervising PS of New Hampshire's reorganization.
09/wsj_0953:They are also indirectly subject to approval by the state of New Hampshire, where residents fear soaring rates to pay for the cost of reorganization. 
09/wsj_0953:Each of the four parties bidding for PS of New Hampshire proposes a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit rate increases to satisfy the state. 
09/wsj_0953:The new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for Judge James Yacos, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, because the company's stockholders, unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans.
09/wsj_0953:In addition, some of the proposals are so close, that non-financial issues such as timing may play a more important role. 
09/wsj_0953:They previously had backed an internal reorganization plan proposed by PS of New Hampshire. 
09/wsj_0953:All of the bidders contemplate full payment including interest to secured creditors.
09/wsj_0953:Geoffrey Kalmus, counsel to the official creditors committee, said that under the United Illuminating plan, unsecured creditors would be paid in full credits and interest of about $855 million, accrued before PS of New Hampshire's Jan. 1988 filing for bankruptcy court protection.
09/wsj_0953:It would be 72%-owned by United Illuminating holders and 28%-owned by current holders of PS of New Hampshire preferred and common stock.
09/wsj_0953:PS of New Hampshire preferred holders also would get certain debentures and preferred stock.
09/wsj_0953:United Illuminating said the preferred holders total package would equal about 60% of their claims.
09/wsj_0953:Common shareholders would end up owning about 6.4% of the combined company. 
09/wsj_0953:The other bidders, New England Electric System, Westboro, Mass., and PS of New Hampshire, didn't change the value of their bids, although PS of New Hampshire changed its rate proposal.
09/wsj_0953:New England Electric values its offer at $2 billion and PS of New Hampshire values its reorganization plan at $2.2 billion. 
09/wsj_0953:However, creditors and bidders alike concede that the state plays a major role because it could significantly delay final settlement of a plan it didn't like. 
09/wsj_0953:PS of New Hampshire amended its plan to call for two years of 5.5% rate increases followed by five years of 4.5% increases.
09/wsj_0953:Previously it had proposed seven years of 5.5% increases. 
09/wsj_0953:The new offer assumes just five years of 5.5% rate increases, to be followed by state-approved increases under the usual hearing procedure.
09/wsj_0953:Previously United Illuminating had also called for seven years of 5.5% increases. 
09/wsj_0953:Most of the plans have reduced bids in case the plant fails to get a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
09/wsj_0953:In New York Stock Exchange trading, PS of New Hampshire's 17 1/2 debenture due 2004 closed yesterday at $82.50, up $2.
09/wsj_0953:In a separate development, PS of New Hampshire gave 60 managers severance agreements that would pay one to three years' salary if their jobs were changed or they were dismissed in the wake of a takeover.
09/wsj_0953:It said the maximum cost of the plan would be $9.7 million. 
09/wsj_0954:C. Hyde Tucker will become president and chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic International Inc., a unit of this telecommunications concern, effective Jan. 1.
09/wsj_0954:Mr. Tucker, 56 years old, is currently vice president and chief operating officer of Bell Atlantic's C&P Telephone unit.
09/wsj_0954:Mr. Tucker will succeed Salvatore J. Barbera, 64, who will hold the newly created position of chairman of the international unit until his retirement April 1. 
09/wsj_0955:It was, after all, only his second full day as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
09/wsj_0955:But the lack of lines became painfully apparent.
09/wsj_0955:As the stock market lurched into a 190-point free fall on Oct. 13, Mr. Breeden found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the SEC -- from his desk, where the New York Stock Exchange was on an open line, to his assistant's office, where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was connected, to a third room, where a computer monitored market moves.
09/wsj_0955:It's all part of a new "command center." 
09/wsj_0955:In an interview and in congressional testimony, he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the second-largest ever -- as evidence of the need for Congress to give the SEC the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market.
09/wsj_0955:A veteran of another financial crisis, the savings-and-loan bailout, Mr. Breeden wants to have the SEC regulate securities issued by banks and S&Ls. 
09/wsj_0955:He believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs, an area the SEC doesn't regulate directly but one where it wields influence both on Wall Street and in Congress. 
09/wsj_0955:As a former White House aide who worked closely with Congress, he is savvy in the ways of Washington.
09/wsj_0955:But Mr. Breeden, a 39-year-old securities lawyer, has skirted some of the heftier issues facing the financial markets.
09/wsj_0955:For instance, he hasn't stated a clear position on high-risk, high-yield junk bonds, an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market spills over into stocks.
09/wsj_0955:He may be waiting to see the results of several pending SEC studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules. 
09/wsj_0955:He also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission, a job vacant since the summer.
09/wsj_0955:Mr. Breeden's selection will be scrutinized as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the SEC's high-profile pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on Wall Street. 
09/wsj_0955:Members of the Senate Banking Committee know Mr. Breeden from working on the thrift-bailout bill, and the relationship generally remains warm.
09/wsj_0955:Some in Washington contend that it's too soon to tell whether Mr. Breeden will help or hinder the SEC. "I don't think this was a real test," says one congressional aide. "It was a fairly stressful weekend, but my sense is if you hadn't had Richard Breeden there, it wouldn't have made much of a difference." 
09/wsj_0955:For some at the SEC, an agency that covets its independence, Mr. Breeden may be too much of a Washington insider.
09/wsj_0955:They note that he has adorned his office with five photos of George Bush, one of them featuring the First Dog, Millie.
09/wsj_0955:Though obscure to most investors, the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in Congress, mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them. 
09/wsj_0955:That event, he contended, simply shows the "vulnerability" of having listings on only one exchange. 
09/wsj_0956:In a corner of the cavernous, new Nippon Convention Center sits Mazda Motor Corp. 's advanced-technology display.
09/wsj_0956:With the touch of a button, drivers can choose from lavender, jasmine, mint or perfume scents, all blown in through the car's air-conditioning system.
09/wsj_0956:The soft, wafting aromas will "improve ride comfort," the display attests, and a proud employee says Mazda hopes to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a year or two. 
09/wsj_0956:But this biennial event, the world's largest display of cars and trucks, has its serious side, including the first major exhibitions of future engines and vehicle-suspension systems.
09/wsj_0956:The hottest displays were items that insulate passengers from bumps, potholes and other rigors of the road.
09/wsj_0956:The two-stroke engine displays by Toyota and Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars, drew plenty of interest from U.S. auto executives, who are rushing to develop two-stroke engines. 
09/wsj_0956:Honda says the five-cylinder engine provides a compromise between the fuel-economy of a four-cylinder, and the power of a V-6.
09/wsj_0956:There's plenty of whimsy here, but it isn't always clear whether it's intentional.
09/wsj_0956:One of its futuristic concepts is the bubblelike Sneaker, which seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of groceries in the rear.
09/wsj_0956:AB Volvo invites passers-by to play "the role of the test dummy" by hopping in a car that simulates a crash to show just how its seat-belt tightener works.
09/wsj_0956:Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea has its first-ever exhibit in Tokyo. 
09/wsj_0956:"We've got to get out of the Detroit mentality and be part of the world mentality," declares Charles M. Jordan, GM's vice president for design, in explaining his pilgrimage to the Tokyo Show. 
09/wsj_0956:True, Ford was declared the winner Sunday, but only after the Honda driver who crossed the finish line first was disqualified because it hit another car and skid momentarily out of bounds. 
09/wsj_0956:Mr. Jordan of GM, meanwhile, still criticizes Japanese styling. "It's hard for the Japanese," he says, "to get a feeling in a car, to get a passion in a car, to get emotion in a car." 
09/wsj_0957:This is a classic example of the old saying, "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts." It's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $50,000 to pay the same 28% incremental tax rate as a family with taxable income of $250,000.
09/wsj_0958:PWA Corp. said it plans to sell by spring 1992 all 15 passenger planes it acquired earlier this year in its 248 million Canadian dollar (US$211.6 million) purchase of Wardair Inc. 
09/wsj_0958:PWA, which recently merged Wardair's operations with those of PWA-owned Canadian Airlines International Ltd., Canada's second-biggest airline, said the proposed sale is part of a revised five-year plan aimed at streamlining its fleet and shedding debt. 
09/wsj_0958:PWA wouldn't estimate the value of Wardair's aircraft, which include 12 Airbus A310-300s and three Boeing 747-100s.
09/wsj_0958:But James Ireland, a Miami-based technical analyst with Avmark Inc., an aircraft evaluation firm, estimated the total "half-life" value of the 15 planes at about $650 million or more. 
09/wsj_0958:Mr. Ireland said 11 DC10-30 aircraft that PWA also said it plans to sell, beginning in 1992, have a current half-life value of about $34 million each, or a total $374 million, raising aggregate potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about $1.02 billion. 
09/wsj_0958:Under its revised fleet plan, PWA said it will also increase its existing fleet of eight Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to 18 by 1994, and add four more Boeing 747-400s by 1994 to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year.
09/wsj_0958:PWA said two of the Boeing 767-300ER aircraft scheduled for delivery in 1990 would be leased out for two to five years. 
09/wsj_0958:PWA didn't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul, but a Toronto-based analyst estimated it at about $450 million (US), excluding replacement costs for the 11 DC10-30 aircraft that PWA plans to sell, and purchase costs for as many as 17 Airbus 320-200 aircraft that PWA previously ordered. 
09/wsj_0958:PWA's long-term debt and capital lease obligations rose to C$1.24 billion at the end of the second quarter, nearly double the year-earlier figure, reflecting debt absorbed under the Wardair purchase. 
09/wsj_0958:PWA said it also expects to announce by Tuesday whether it will take delivery of all 17 Airbus 320-200 aircraft it previously ordered.
09/wsj_0959:Mr. Padovan is currently a director at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. Graham Pimlott, 40, was named to the new post of chief executive officer of the merchant-banking corporate-finance division.
09/wsj_0959:Callum McCarthy, 45, was named to the new post of deputy head of the corporate-finance division and a managing director.
09/wsj_0960:The House is scheduled to vote today on an anti-airline-takeover bill that would block, for up to 50 days, any bid for 15% or more of a U.S. airline, even a straight cash purchase.
09/wsj_0961:Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) and Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) -- that, among other things, would require the Fed to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the Fed. 
09/wsj_0961:In responding to questions, Mr. Greenspan played down reports of tension between the Fed and the Treasury over exchange-rate policy. 
09/wsj_0961:"What seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics," he said.
09/wsj_0961:But the Fed isn't enthusiastic about Treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets, and the Treasury is frustrated at the Fed's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar's value. 
09/wsj_0961:Mr. Greenspan said the inflation rate, currently about 4 1/2%, "could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession, but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output." In other words, economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years.
09/wsj_0961:But Mr. Greenspan, who has repeatedly said the Fed's goal is to reduce inflation, added that "whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter." 
09/wsj_0961:Even so, his bill is given little chance of passage. 
09/wsj_0961:While each of the Hamilton-Dorgan proposals represents only a small step, together they would erode the Fed's independence, Mr. Greenspan said. 
09/wsj_0961:Mr. Greenspan also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic policy, he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise embodied in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and result in higher marginal income tax rates. 
09/wsj_0962:Sears, Roebuck & Co. signed a contract with Bob Vila, the former host of the popular public television program "This Old House," to star in a half-hour home improvement show sponsored by the giant retailer. 
09/wsj_0962:The do-it-yourself show, slated to start airing by June 1990, marks Sears's entry into the burgeoning market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products.
09/wsj_0962:In recent months, sales of home improvement items have sagged, along with sales of other big ticket durable goods. 
09/wsj_0962:Earlier this year, public television station WGBH in Boston fired Mr. Vila after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements. 
09/wsj_0962:With Mr. Vila as host, "This Old House" became one of the Public Broadcasting Service's top 10 programs, airing weekly on about 300 of the network's stations and seen by an average of 12 million viewers. 
09/wsj_0962:Ogilvy & Mather in Chicago, a unit of WPP Group PLC, will handle the advertising account and syndication. 
09/wsj_0962:The only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of Time-Life home improvement and repair books.
09/wsj_0963:Eugene A. Miller, 52 years old, was elected a director of this electric utility company, filling a vacancy.
09/wsj_0963:He is president and chief executive officer of Comerica Inc. in Detroit. 
09/wsj_0964:The White House has decided to push for changes in pesticide law that are designed to speed the removal of harmful chemicals from the nation's food supply. 
09/wsj_0964:Environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part of the proposal. 
09/wsj_0964:But they are already objecting to, among other things, a plan to give more weight to cost-benefit considerations in evaluating pesticides."It's a tremendous disappointment," said Janet Hathaway, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Allowing the EPA to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community." 
09/wsj_0964:The Bush administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that embody them.
09/wsj_0964:The principles would give the Environmental Protection Agency increased authority and flexibility in regulating pesticides, with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly.
09/wsj_0964:Moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous pesticides gained new impetus during this year's Alar scare, when the EPA was harshly criticized for failing to yank the possible carcinogen, a growth regulator used to make apples redder and crunchier.
09/wsj_0964:-- Allow the EPA to permit the continued use of pesticides that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost. 
09/wsj_0965:Long-term Treasury bonds rose slightly despite the arrival on the market of $4.52 billion in 30-year bonds offered by the Resolution Funding Corp. as part of the government's bailout of the savings and loan industry.
09/wsj_0965:Yesterday's sluggish action was in marked contrast to the rearing and plunging of stock prices Tuesday after the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp. once again collapsed.
09/wsj_0965:Traders said the stock market's lurching moves have prompted many investors to head for the sidelines until it regains some semblance of stability. 
09/wsj_0965:Bond investors paid close attention to comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was testifying before a congressional hearing, but weren't able to extract many clues about the future course of the Fed's monetary policy.
09/wsj_0965:Many analysts are expecting the Fed to lower interest rates at least once more before the end of the year. 
09/wsj_0965:Investors now are awaiting today's release of the preliminary estimate of third-quarter gross national product.
09/wsj_0965:Economists predict the report will show economic growth of about 2.5% in the third quarter, which would have little effect on financial markets.
09/wsj_0965:But advancing issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners 784 to 700. 
09/wsj_0965:The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue rose less than an eighth of a point, or less than $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount.
09/wsj_0966:A few years ago, I was on a panel of journalists that discussed the "image" of intercollegiate athletics for an audience of campus information directors and others.
09/wsj_0966:We scribblers quickly concurred that not only was the bad rep of big-time college sports richly earned, but also that it could be corrected.
09/wsj_0966:As the session broke up, I was approached by a man who identified himself as the alumni director of a Big Ten university. "I'd love to see sports cut back, and so would a lot of my counterparts at other schools, but everybody's afraid to make the first move," he confided. "It's like the U.S. and the Russians: Nobody wants to disarm first." 
09/wsj_0966:And so our institutions of higher learning lurch from scandal to scandal on gridiron and basketball court, while the casualties mount.
09/wsj_0966:Three new books make the point that one large price of the glittery college-sports show can be the integrity of the schools that stage it.
09/wsj_0966:They are: "A Payroll to Meet: A Story of Greed, Corruption and Football at SMU" (Macmillan, 221 pages, $18.95) by David Whitford; "Big Red Confidential: Inside Nebraska Football" (Contemporary, 231 pages, $17.95) by Armen Keteyian; and "Never Too Young to Die: The Death of Len Bias" (Pantheon, 252 pages, $18.95) by Lewis Cole. 
09/wsj_0966:The pick of the group is "Payroll"; it should be required reading for every college president.
09/wsj_0966:It chronicles how, over a period of a dozen years, Southern Methodist University bought its way to football respectability in the Southwest Conference, only to find itself trapped and strangled by the athlete-payoff system it created.
09/wsj_0966:Given current headlines about the University of Florida, it may not be the last. 
09/wsj_0966:There's a memorable passage in which Mr. Shields, having finally learned of the practice, expresses his outrage to Bill Clements, then a university governor (and now the governor of Texas!) and oil man Edwin Cox, chairman of the board of trustees. 
09/wsj_0966:"You stay out of it," author Whitford quotes Mr. Clements as saying. "Go run the university." Which was about what Mr. Shields did, and quietly, until he resigned a few years later, pleading ill health, when the stuff hit the fan. 
09/wsj_0966:Mr. Whitford drew on voluminous news media coverage of the SMU scandal, and on a university internal investigation.
09/wsj_0966:Mr. Keteyian had to do most of his own digging on University of Nebraska football, which is, to date, high and dry as far as the NCAA is concerned.
09/wsj_0966:Still, the book produces more smoke than a smoldering sofa, along with a few flames, especially concerning the use of steroids.
09/wsj_0966:It's a mystery how this could have escaped the notice of Nebraska coaches.
09/wsj_0966:"Never Too Young" is a different sort of work, focusing on the 1986 death from cocaine ingestion of Bias, a University of Maryland basketball star ticketed for sure pro stardom.
09/wsj_0966:While the university was no more to blame for that than for the similar fate of any other student, it must bear responsibility for its conduct in the aftermath. 
09/wsj_0966:Bias's coach, Lefty Driesell, ordered the room in which Bias died to be cleaned before the police could arrive (the order wasn't carried out), and the school's athletics director issued false information about the academic standing of Bias and other players.
09/wsj_0966:Those, of course, were the responses of people with something to hide.
09/wsj_0966:Tomorrow's "On Sports" column will look at another aspect of the college sports mess. 
09/wsj_0967:Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc., a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, paid Massachusetts $9.1 million in taxes, bringing to an end a 10-month-long corporate tax chase. 
09/wsj_0967:Officials at the Department of Revenue had dogged the foreign car maker for taxes owed on business transactions and were proceeding to settle the dispute in court.
09/wsj_0967:But "the check arrived in the mail," said Stephen Kidder, Massachusetts Commissioner of Revenue. 
09/wsj_0967:Mercedes-Benz, which had said it didn't owe taxes to Massachusetts partly because it sells its cars at a dock in Baltimore and not in Massachusetts, didn't explain its change of heart. 
09/wsj_0967:The dispute was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in August. 
09/wsj_0967:Under Massachusetts tax laws, corporations must pay 9.5% of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company conducts a variety of non-sales activities, including warranties, customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships. 
09/wsj_0968:National Convenience Stores Inc., trying to shake the doldrums in the convenience-store business, said it will rearrange the merchandise in all of its stores in the next 18 months to cater better to the neighborhoods around its stores. 
09/wsj_0968:As part of the plan, the Houston-based company's 1,100 Stop 'N Go stores will be refocused to target black, Hispanic, upscale or core middle-class customers.
09/wsj_0968:Stores in Hispanic areas will stock an assortment of Spanish-language magazines, Mexican cooking items and candies.
09/wsj_0968:Stores in the company's core middle-class market will get more frozen and quick-to-prepare foods and a greater selection of bottled water. 
09/wsj_0968:"There are an increasing number of people out there who are time-poor," said Chris Vroom, retail analyst with Alex.
09/wsj_0968:Brown & Sons of Baltimore. "Those are primarily white-collar workers, a customer segment that has historically proved elusive for convenience stores." 
09/wsj_0968:National Convenience's move is likely to be echoed by other chains, though analysts note that Southland Corp., owner of 7-Eleven stores, and Circle K Corp. are too debt-heavy to roll out such an extensive effort.
09/wsj_0968:Analysts said the company's effort will be helped by its decision last year to put point-of-sale scanners in 200 stores, allowing National Convenience to quickly track items that are selling and those that aren't. 
09/wsj_0969:Previous talks between Pittston, of Greenwich, Conn., and the union have been sporadic and unsuccessful. 
09/wsj_0970:One day after Delmed Inc. made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie, its stock didn't trade and the company forecast a "significant" drop next year in sales of its core product. 
09/wsj_0970:The spokeswoman said the exchange would resume trading of Delmed stock today. 
09/wsj_0970:Delmed, which makes and sells peritoneal dialysis products used in treating kidney disease, on Tuesday announced the resignations of Robert S. Ehrlich, chairman, president and chief executive officer, and of Leslie I. Shapiro, chief operating officer and chief financial officer.
09/wsj_0970:They were succeeded by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent, Fresenius AG, which owns about 45% of Delmed. 
09/wsj_0970:At the same time, the New Brunswick, N.J., company said negotiations about pricing and volumes of product had collapsed between it and its exclusive distributor in the U.S., National Medical Care Inc. Following that announcement Tuesday, however, company officials were unavailable to elaborate. 
09/wsj_0970:Yesterday, the spokeswoman said sales of Delmed products through the exclusive arrangement with National Medical accounted for 87% of Delmed's 1988 sales of $21.1 million.
09/wsj_0970:The current distribution arrangement ends in March 1990, although Delmed said it will continue to provide some supplies of the peritoneal dialysis products to National Medical, the spokeswoman said. 
09/wsj_0970:But the plan now is being "reformulated," Delmed said, declining to provide most of the new terms of the combination.
09/wsj_0970:The value of the company has changed." 
09/wsj_0971:But July 5, a thunderstorm in Wilmington, Del., caused Shellpot Creek to rise 15 feet, pouring 1.3 million gallons of water into basement vaults.
09/wsj_0971:The water destroyed about $75 million in currency and caked $4 million of coins with mud, rendering them dangerous to counting machines. 
09/wsj_0971:The $75 million in paper money, although moldy, mildewy and smelly, was exchanged through the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia without incident.
09/wsj_0971:"We kind of got caught between bureaucracies," says President William F. Brooks Jr.
09/wsj_0971:A Mint official says the agency offered to clean the coins for its "bare-bones" cost of $17,000 plus certain other expenses.
09/wsj_0971:For eight hours a day for the past two weeks, in aggregates of as much as 27,000 pounds (equaling $20,000 in pennies), Coin Wrap has been pouring money into a cement-mixing truck.
09/wsj_0971:After clanging around for an hour or so, the shiny, hot money pours out of the cement chute, where a giant vacuum sucks away the dried mud and burnt wrappers.
09/wsj_0971:Brooks expects to pay Coin Wrap a total of about $20,000 -- a cost that insurance won't cover.
09/wsj_0971:In fact, there's only one person involved who's happy, and that's Floyd String, president of Coin Wrap and conceiver of the cement-truck solution.
09/wsj_0971:Not only did his company find $20,000 worth of work, but when the approach was suggested, Mr. String says, Brooks officials "didn't laugh at me or anything." 
09/wsj_0972:Some of our best and most idiosyncratic film makers -- from Truffaut to Fellini to Woody Allen -- have taken a cue from Chekhov: When it comes to compelling drama, there's no place like home. 
09/wsj_0972:Written by Barbara Benedek, co-author of "The Big Chill," "Immediate Family" takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children.
09/wsj_0972:All of their friends have children and they can't, so now they want a child more than anything -- perhaps even more than Michael wanted his fancy convertible or his deluxe stereo equipment.
09/wsj_0972:The idea of a child-as-required-yuppie-possession must be motivating them, since the wealthy offspring of their friends are shown to be rude brats, in therapy by age five. 
09/wsj_0972:The actors wear pained expressions to indicate their genuine longing for a little one -- or maybe they're not-so-subtly commenting on the inadequacy of the script, and Jonathan Kaplan's ("The Accused") dull direction.
09/wsj_0972:Or maybe they are disgusted by the literal-minded musical score; when a character arrives at a major decision her thoughts are revealed by the sound of "I Can See Clearly Now." The adoption agency insists on introducing the adopting parents to the birth mother, so Linda and Michael pay for pregnant Lucy's (Ms.
09/wsj_0972:I ask this not necessarily as a native Ohioan.) Lucy, of course, is pretty and smart, though uneducated.
09/wsj_0972:At the other end of the life cycle is "Dad," Gary David Goldberg's adaptation of the William Wharton novel.
09/wsj_0972:His characters practically scamper through a vast range of human emotions, like travelers doing 10 cities in eight days.
09/wsj_0972:They pause only to register little whimpers of distress and sighs of satisfaction, like tourists cataloging the sights they've seen from the window of a bus.
09/wsj_0972:It starts with conception, taking the sperm's point of view, then progresses to the baby's point of view.
09/wsj_0972:Bruce Willis's best attribute as an actor is his coy, lazy voice, and that's all you get of him here, speaking for the baby. 
09/wsj_0972:Finally, there is one family movie that quite eloquently explores the depth of human emotion -- only its stars are bears.
09/wsj_0972:For the second time, in a movie called "The Bear," French director Jean-Jacques Annaud demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be. ("Quest for Fire" was the first time.) To be sure, one wonders what kind of man is this, who feels compelled to try to understand the most primitive longing and instinct in a way that requires the most sophisticated appreciation of visual storytelling.
09/wsj_0972:The animals' point of view." 
09/wsj_0972:But then, even a great many words couldn't summarize the extraordinary pull of this movie about an orphaned bear who adopts a parent. 
09/wsj_0972:Video Tip: One of the best movies about the child-parent thing in recent years was "Raising Arizona," the 1987 Coen brothers' comedy that definitely was not about the folks next door. 
09/wsj_0973:Westinghouse Electric Corp., capitalizing on a major restructuring program, expects operating margins of more than 10% and double-digit per-share earnings growth next year, top officers told securities analysts here. 
09/wsj_0973:In 1988, the company earned $822.8 million, or $5.66 a share, on sales of $12.49 billion. 
09/wsj_0973:In the past 20 months alone, Paul E. Lego, president and chief operating officer, said the divestiture of $300 million of slow-growth, low-profit businesses has been more than offset by $600 million in profitable acquisitions. 
09/wsj_0973:Even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of 2% to 2.5%, "we can handle that," Mr. Marous said.
09/wsj_0973:GNP is the total value of the nation's output of goods and services. 
09/wsj_0973:A bright spot is the company's power-generation business, which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years.
09/wsj_0973:Mr. Marous said the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company's target goal of 8.5%. 
09/wsj_0973:He said the independent power segment could grow to provide as much as 50% of near-term generation capacity, adding: "We expect to supply a significant share of this market." 
09/wsj_0973:Westinghouse also expects its international sales to soon grow to 25% of total corporate sales from 20% last year.
09/wsj_0973:Mr. Marous said Westinghouse would own 70% of the facility.
09/wsj_0973:Company officials also said that any gain from the sale of Westinghouse's 55% stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the Swiss firm of Asea Brown Boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.
09/wsj_0973:The executives didn't disclose the size of the expected gain. 
09/wsj_0974:Because of an error by the National Association of Securities Dealers, the listing appeared incorrectly in the main table and several highlight tables in yesterday's edition. 
09/wsj_0975:A proposed conflict-of-interest policy for federally funded biomedical researchers may thwart many high-technology new ventures, say financiers, researchers and university administrators. 
09/wsj_0975:The National Institutes of Health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health-care businesses -- or lose their government money.
09/wsj_0975:As ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in recent years, governmental fear of abuse has risen. 
09/wsj_0975:But the guidelines could "make it impossible to commercialize research," says Kenneth Smith, associate provost and vice president for research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
09/wsj_0975:The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind Lithox Inc., a Salem, Mass., start-up, says Robert Daly, a managing partner of TA Associates, a venture-capital firm.
09/wsj_0975:With $2.3 million, he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the University of California at San Diego. 
09/wsj_0975:The researchers, who are being financed by the Lithox funds, will receive a royalty, or percentage of sales, if their research yields a commercial product.
09/wsj_0975:But because the University of California, like many other universities, shares its royalties with researchers, it may disqualify itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines, Mr. Daly says. 
09/wsj_0975:The high-tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect.
09/wsj_0975:Scientists Rima Kaddurah-Daouk and Paul Schimmel conducted the initial research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
09/wsj_0975:The Amira transaction is typical of the way venture-capital firms are approaching the task of commercializing biotechnology research.
09/wsj_0975:While universities develop the basic research, "venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization," says Gloria W. Doubleday of Commonwealth. "This is the best way to transfer technology straight off the campuses of universities." 
09/wsj_0975:And if that happens, the entire process of transferring technology to the marketplace could be harmed, they say. 
09/wsj_0975:Many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to commercialize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties. 
09/wsj_0975:In many of these deals, "venture capitalists had the inside track," says Lawrence Bock of Avalon Ventures, La Jolla, Calif.
09/wsj_0975:Last year, for example, Avalon and others invested $14 million in Athena Neurosciences Inc., South San Francisco, Calif., to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain.
09/wsj_0975:But before Athena was able to get an exclusive license to the technology, the Federal Register published most of the details, "giving all of the company's potential competitors a chance to exploit it," Mr. Bock says.
09/wsj_0975:If start-ups can't have early access to research being conducted at institutions, "we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research," says Ruth Emyanitoff, manager of business development at Applied bioTechnology Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., concern.
09/wsj_0975:NIH staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the escalation of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures.
09/wsj_0975:Not long ago, scientists holding stock in Spectra Pharmaceutical Services Inc. were accused of falsifying research to boost the stock.
09/wsj_0975:Among other provisions, the NIH guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research. 
09/wsj_0975:Ms. Bick, the NIH administrator, says the business and scientific community is overreacting to what the agency merely meant to be "ideas for discussion." The predictions of doom are "premature," she says. 
09/wsj_0975:On Sept. 14, Harvard began circulating a conflict-of-interest policy statement that, in effect, would follow the NIH guidelines faithfully. 
09/wsj_0975:The University of California at San Francisco is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business.
09/wsj_0976:Friday, Oct. 27, 9 p.m.-midnight EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and times vary, so check local listings): "Show Boat." New Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse produced this faithful revival of America's most influential musical, written by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein and first produced on Broadway in 1927.
09/wsj_0976:Saturday, Oct. 28, 8-10 p.m. EDT, on HBO (repeated Oct. 31, Nov. 5, 8, 14, 16 and 20): "Perfect Witness." Aidan Quinn, Brian Dennehy and Stockard Channing are excellent in this gripping tale of a reluctant witness in an organized crime prosecution.
09/wsj_0976:It's set in New York, but it resonates with the terrible dynamics of the Latin American drug wars. 
09/wsj_0976:Sunday, Oct. 29, 8-11 p.m. EST, on ABC: "The Final Days." No doubt there is something to irk everyone in this AT&T-sponsored dramatization of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book about Watergate.
09/wsj_0976:Personally, I'm irked by its combination of ponderousness and timidity, which adds up to an utter lack of drama. 
09/wsj_0976:Sunday, Oct. 29, 10-11 p.m. EST, on Showtime (repeated Nov. 2, 6, 11 and 15): "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." Fans of Anthony Andrews ("Brideshead Revisited") will relish watching him play the title role(s) in the 19th-century Robert Louis Stevenson pre-Freudian drama of schizoid horror. 
09/wsj_0976:Monday, Oct. 30, 10-11 p.m. EST, on PBS: "Journey Into Sleep." I promise you will stay awake through this intriguing documentary about the science of sleep. 
09/wsj_0976:Wednesday, Nov. 1, 9-10:30 p.m. EST, on PBS: "Thomas Hart Benton." Critical opinion is divided about the success of Benton's populist defiance of modernist art.
09/wsj_0976:Thursdays, Nov. 2-23, 10-11 p.m. EST, on PBS: "Taiwan: The Other China." Judy Woodruff hosts this handsome four-part series about the history, economy, culture and politics of the island home of Chinese democracy and capitalism. 
09/wsj_0976:Friday, Nov. 3, 9-11 p.m. EST, on PBS: "Our Town." Along with "Show Boat," "Great Performances" kicks off its new season with this Lincoln Center production of Thornton Wilder's best known play, in which the role of the small-town Stage Manager is given a hip twist by performance artist Spalding Gray. 
09/wsj_0976:Polished hooves, fancy turf, fat purses -- the horse race of the year. 
09/wsj_0976:Shiny Nikes, cracked cement, media glory -- the foot race of the year. 
09/wsj_0976:Sundays, Nov. 5-12, 9-10:30 p.m. EST, on PBS: "Glory Enough for All." Can "Masterpiece Theatre" make a compelling human story out of the discovery of insulin?
09/wsj_0976:Sunday and Monday, Nov. 5 and 6, 9-11 p.m. EST, on NBC: "Cross of Fire." The Ku Klux Klan was revived in the 1920s as a national organization aimed at Catholics and Jews as well as blacks.
09/wsj_0976:One reason for its downfall was the murder trial of D.C. Stephenson, an Indiana leader whose reckless career is depicted in this film starring Mel Harris ("thirtysomething") and John Heard. 
09/wsj_0976:You'll remember when you see the stunning footage taken from inside a hurricane's eye, in this edition of "NOVA." 
09/wsj_0977:Merksamer Jewelers Inc., a fast-growing jewelry store chain, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors, apparently to speed a management buy-out of the chain. 
09/wsj_0977:GE Capital Corp., a financial services subsidiary of General Electric Co., is providing Merksamer management with $15 million in financing. 
09/wsj_0977:L.J. Hooker's planned sale of Merksamer is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
09/wsj_0977:At that time, Sam Merksamer, president of the chain, angrily denied that his company was about to file.
09/wsj_0977:According to executives close to the situation, Merksamer filed for Chapter 11 to speed the sale of the chain.
09/wsj_0977:One executive said an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of L.J. Hooker Corp. had frozen in place all of L.J. Hooker's assets. 
09/wsj_0977:The Merksamer bankruptcy-law filing appears to supersede that agreement. "By filing for Chapter 11, the Merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale, not the hundreds of unsecured creditors," said this executive. "The cash from the sale will go to L.J. Hooker, but the company itself will belong to Sam Merksamer." 
09/wsj_0977:Mr. Merksamer and Sanford Sigoloff, chief executive of L.J. Hooker, were unavailable for comment.
09/wsj_0977:The jewelry chain, which is based in Sacramento, Calif., had revenue of $62 million and operating profit of $2.5 million for the year ended June 30. 
09/wsj_0978:For all of this year's explosive run-up in stock prices, Renaissance Investment Management Inc. 's computer sat on the sidelines.
09/wsj_0978:Renaissance, a Cincinnati-based money manager, began buying stocks again this week with half of the $1.8 billion that it oversees for clients, according to people familiar with the firm's revised strategy.
09/wsj_0978:Renaissance declined to confirm the move, but its stock purchases were thought to have begun Tuesday, timed to coincide with the maturity this week of Treasury bills owned by the firm.
09/wsj_0978:The other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in Treasury bills for the time being. 
09/wsj_0978:As reported, PaineWebber bought shares Tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift, although the broker's client was said then to have been Japanese.
09/wsj_0978:When it owns stocks, Renaissance's portfolio typically is composed of about 60 large-capitalization issues; to make buy or sell moves, the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance, looking for the best package price to carry out the trades.
09/wsj_0978:The Dow average now stands more than 20% higher, while Renaissance's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of about 6% through the first three quarters of the year.
09/wsj_0978:Three-month T-bill yields have fallen to 7.8% from about 9% at the start of the year.
09/wsj_0978:Stock prices, meanwhile, are about 140 points lower than the peak of 2791.41 reached on the Dow industrial average Oct. 9.
09/wsj_0978:Mr. Terrizzi won't say specifically, explaining that if there was such a move, it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction.
09/wsj_0978:During that time, a buyer with the clout of a Renaissance could end up driving up the price of stocks it was trying to buy if it tipped its hand. 
09/wsj_0978:The firm has made 17 previous shifts from one type of asset to another in its 10-year history.
09/wsj_0979:David Evans, who last week resigned as president and chief executive of Qintex Entertainment Inc. "for personal reasons" just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection, has been temporarily reappointed to both positions, the company said. 
09/wsj_0979:Mr. Evans will stay until a successor is found, but not later than the end of the year, the company said. 
09/wsj_0979:It was the 49-year-old Mr. Evans who had moved into the offices of MGM/UA and run the company during Qintex Australia Ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company.
09/wsj_0979:After MGM/UA terminated the $1.5 billion merger because of a dispute over a $50 million letter of credit, Qintex Entertainment -- which is 43%-owned by Qintex Australia -- found itself facing problems of its own.
09/wsj_0979:On Oct. 19, Qintex Entertainment was about to default on a $5.9 million payment owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of a television program.
09/wsj_0979:But early on Oct. 19, the second of two hectic days of board meetings, Mr. Evans said he believed Qintex Australia wouldn't be forthcoming.
09/wsj_0979:He recommended that the company file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before the MCA deadline, according to a source familiar with the sessions. 
09/wsj_0979:But a majority of the board, which includes three members from the Australian company, overrode him.
09/wsj_0980:On top of this, the traveler who converts his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion.
09/wsj_0980:At the end of the trip, any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars, with another commission due. 
09/wsj_0980:Typically, he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure, and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the bill.
09/wsj_0981:MGM Grand Inc. has agreed to pay $93 million and nearly 1.8 million common shares to buy 117 acres of land along the Las Vegas, Nev., Strip as a site for its planned movie-studio and theme-park resort. 
09/wsj_0981:Of the total purchase price, $50 million cash and $30 million in stock (nearly 1.8 million shares) would be paid to buy the existing 700-room Marina Hotel & Casino from Southwest Securities, a Nevada limited partnership.
09/wsj_0981:The remaining properties to be acquired are the Tropicana Country Club & Golf Course, a facility jointly owned by Ramada Inc., of Phoenix, Ariz., and the Jaffe family, and a small parcel owned by MGM Grand director James D. Aljian. 
09/wsj_0981:The purchase price was disclosed in a preliminary prospectus issued in connection with MGM Grand's planned offering of six million common shares.
09/wsj_0981:The proposed stock offering and issuance of nearly 1.8 million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring MGM Grand's total shares outstanding to 28.7 million, of which 72% will be owned by Mr. Kerkorian and Tracinda, according to the prospectus. 
09/wsj_0981:Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for remodeling the company's Desert Inn resort in Las Vegas, refurbishing certain aircraft of the MGM Grand Air unit, and to acquire the property for the new resort.
09/wsj_0981:The company said it estimates the Desert Inn remodeling will cost about $32 million, and the refurbishment of the three DC-8-62 aircraft, made by McDonnell Douglas Corp., will cost around $24.5 million. 
09/wsj_0981:MGM Grand said the latest stock offering won't cover the $600 million or more cost of building the proposed resort and theme park, and added it will need to seek additional financing, either through bank borrowings or debt and equity offerings, at a later date.
09/wsj_0981:The resort will include the MGM Grand Hotel, a multi-spired, castle-like facility that will include 5,000 rooms and 85,000 square feet of casino space.
09/wsj_0982:Assets of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report jumped to $351.2 billion in the week ended Tuesday, the Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter said.
09/wsj_0982:Meanwhile, the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly a tenth of a percentage point, the largest drop since midsummer.
09/wsj_0982:"Lower yields are just reflecting lower short-term interest rates," said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report.
09/wsj_0982:Money funds invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit, all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring. 
09/wsj_0982:The average yield on six-month CDs of $50,000 or less at major banks was 7.96% in the week ended Tuesday, according to Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service. 
09/wsj_0982:One way that money fund managers boost yields in a declining rate environment is by extending the maturities of their investments, so they can earn the current higher rates for a longer period.
09/wsj_0982:The average maturity of the taxable funds that Donoghue's follows increased by two days in the latest week to 40 days, its longest since August. 
09/wsj_0982:"They're anticipating further declines in rates and they're going to get them, slowly," said Walter Frank, chief economist for the Donoghue Organization, publisher of Money Fund Report. 
09/wsj_0982:Average maturity was as short as 29 days at the start of this year, when short-term interest rates were moving steadily upward.
09/wsj_0982:The average seven-day compound yield of the funds reached 9.62% in late April. 
09/wsj_0982:The top-performing fund in the latest week was Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar, with a seven-day compound yield of 9.45%.
09/wsj_0982:The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds fell to 8.14% from 8.21%, Donoghue's reported.
09/wsj_0983:These people invested in "leveraged" junk bond mutual funds, the publicly traded funds that make a habit of taking out loans to buy extra junk. 
09/wsj_0983:It's a good strategy in a rising market, where a 25% leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have 125% of their money working for them.
09/wsj_0983:And shares of leveraged junk funds this year have been clobbered even harder than the junk bonds they hold. 
09/wsj_0983:Leverage is used only by some of the closed-end funds. 
09/wsj_0983:With a leveraged position of about 45%, the fund's share price has plunged 28.5% so far this year.
09/wsj_0983:Leveraged funds in particular "are still extremely vulnerable, because we're still at the beginning of problems in the junk market," says George Foot, a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates in Northampton, Mass. 
09/wsj_0983:Many investors are unaware their funds have borrowed to speculate in such a risky market. "If someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold," says Gerald Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in Chicago, they might shy away. 
09/wsj_0983:Fund managers, for their part, defend their use of leverage.
09/wsj_0983:Ms. Terry did say the fund's recent performance "illustrates what happens in a leveraged product" when the market doesn't cooperate. "When the market turns around," she says, "it will give a nice picture" of how leverage can help performance. 
09/wsj_0983:He says the fund, which is 40% leveraged, has maintained a "substantial cushion" between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio's bonds. "I don't want to be in a position to have to sell," Mr. Frabotta says. 
09/wsj_0983:Because of the recent junk-market turmoil, the fund is considering investing in other issues instead, including mortgage-backed bonds. 
09/wsj_0983:"We're looking at the leverage factor every day," says Robert Moore, president of Bernstein-Macaulay Inc., a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit and the fund's adviser. "At some point, if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost -- and at the moment we're right on it -- we're going to have to make a move." 
09/wsj_0984:One of the more bizarre garden stories since Eden has been unfolding for four years now, in the private paper-and-crayon fantasies of artist Jennifer Bartlett.
09/wsj_0984:South Gardens, as the Bartlett scheme is called, will occupy the last 3.5 acres of open space at the southwest tip of Manhattan.
09/wsj_0984:Created by an artist who flaunts her ignorance of plants and gardens, South Gardens, as now planned, will die from congestive garden design. 
09/wsj_0984:Last year she boasted to HG magazine: "I'd never looked at a garden in my life." And she proved no shirking violet in her initial statement to the BPCA, a New York State public benefit corporation: "The only thing I was interested in doing was a very complicated garden, which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain." 
09/wsj_0984:Undeterred, the BPCA hired Ms. Bartlett and another confessed garden ignoramus, the architect Alexander Cooper, who claimed he had never visited, much less built, a garden, and said of the project, "I don't view this as a landscape.
09/wsj_0984:The firm of Bruce Kelly/David Varnell Landscape Architects had created Central Park's Strawberry Fields and Shakespeare Garden.
09/wsj_0984:She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- trees, water, landscape fragments, rudimentary square houses, circles, triangles, rectangles -- and fit them into a grid, as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall.
09/wsj_0984:But for South Gardens, the grid was to be a 3-D network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them.
09/wsj_0984:All the while, Ms. Bartlett had been busy at her assignment, serene in her sense of self-tilth.
09/wsj_0984:As she put it in a 1987 lecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design: "I have designed a garden, not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip." Moreover, she proclaimed that "landscape architects have been going wrong for the last 20 years" in the design of open space.
09/wsj_0984:And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design method: Commissioning a friend to spend "five or six thousand dollars . . . on books that I ultimately cut up." After that, the layout had been easy. "I've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail." Ms. Bartlett told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client "because I don't think you can do watered-down versions of things." (This was never a problem with South Gardens, because the client had long since given in to Ms. Bartlett's every whim.) 
09/wsj_0984:Last year the public was afforded a preview of Ms. Bartlett's creation in a tablemodel version, at a BPC exhibition.
09/wsj_0984:The labels were breathy: "Within its sheltering walls is a microcosm of a thousand years in garden design . . . a rose garden, herb garden, serpentine garden, flower fields, an apple orchard . . . organized in a patchwork of 50-by-50-foot squares to form `rooms' . . . here and there are simple architectural forms, a whimsical jet of water, a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid, and chairs of every sort to drag around. . . . At the core of it all is a love for plants." 
09/wsj_0984:This mincemeat of tiny gridlocked squares was inspired by the artist's own digs: "My loft was 50 by 100 feet, so 50 feet by 50 feet seemed like a good garden room." 
09/wsj_0984:Inside the grid were 24 of these plant cells jammed full of clutter.
09/wsj_0984:Another she stuffed with eight "rectilinear hedges" for a topiary geometry lesson in the right-angling of plants.
09/wsj_0984:In one garden roomette she implanted a 43-foot square glass cube meant to show off a plaid tile floor conceit, a "zinc sink," a "huge fishbowl with carp" and a "birdcage with cockatoos." Next door she put a smaller plaid-floored glass house, where, she suggested, a flat of strawberries might be displayed in the dead of winter. 
09/wsj_0984:In another compartment called the Linden Bosque, 62 linden trees were to be crowded together at killing intervals of 10 or 16 feet. (Lindens need about 36 feet.) 
09/wsj_0984:One thing about the Bartlett plan was never in doubt: It would demand the full-time skills of a battalion of topiary barbers, rosarians, orchardists and arborists.
09/wsj_0984:It was hard to see how photosynthesis would ever happen in South Gardens without decking the walls in a Christmas-like array of Gro-Lites. 
09/wsj_0984:Finally, flouting the BPCA's wishes to continue the popular two-mile riverside Esplanade, prized for its expansive views of New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, Ms. Bartlett threw up yet another wall, this time concrete, this time 10 1/2 feet tall.
09/wsj_0984:She ran it the length of the South Gardens riverfront, blotting out the city's great natural water features, the harbor and the river. (Within her garden, she has decreed a waterfall, a rill, ponds and other costly, trivial waterworks beside the Hudson.) 
09/wsj_0984:The Parks Council wrote the BPCA that this "too `private' . . . exclusive," complex and expensive "enclosed garden . . . belongs in almost any location but the waterfront." Lynden B. Miller, the noted public garden designer who restored Central Park's Conservatory Garden, recalls her reaction to the South Gardens model in light of the public garden she was designing for 42nd Street's Bryant Park: "Bryant Park, as designed in 1933, failed as a public space, because it made people feel trapped.
09/wsj_0984:It seems to me the BPCA plan has the potential of making South Gardens a horticultural jail for people and plants." 
09/wsj_0984:The three urban horticulture experts with Cornell Cooperative Extension weighed in with a letter to the BPCA that began: "We feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed." They then addressed the decidedly "questionable safety of . . . a complex garden of endless hiding places.
09/wsj_0984:The 8 ft. hedges which obstruct views in and out of small `rooms' insure . . . that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime." (At Harvard, Ms. Bartlett had declared: "There are going to be problems with safety . . . I'm not going to address questions of safety!") 
09/wsj_0984:Despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden professionals, Ms. Bartlett's South Gardens design somehow continues on, seemingly impervious to reason, stalled only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications.
09/wsj_0984:BPCA President and CEO David Emil hopes to negotiate a seawall that could "be significantly more visually permeable." And by substituting yet another landscape architect, Nicholas Quennell, he insists he can achieve that and other accommodations to gardening reality while still preserving the "artistic vision" of a "truly great artist." After four years of no progress in this direction, it is doubtful any viable collaboration with Ms. Bartlett will suddenly now be possible. (Mr.
09/wsj_0984:Quennell has said he plans to go with the grid, regardless.) There is still time, however, for Gov. Mario Cuomo or Fabian Palomino, chairman of the BPCA board, to prevent this topiary "Tilted Arc." 
09/wsj_0984:These statesmen might take counsel from William Robinson, author of "The English Flower Garden" -- the gardener's bible since 1883 -- who seems to have had a Jennifer Bartlett in mind when he wrote: "Unhappily, our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when applying his `designs' to the garden. . . . It is this adapting of absurd `knots' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design -- wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants." 
09/wsj_0985:I read the exerpts of Wayne Angell's exchange with a Gosbank representative ("Put the Soviet Economy on Golden Rails," editorial page, Oct. 5) with great interest, since the gold standard is one of my areas of research.
09/wsj_0985:Mr. Angell is incorrect when he states that the Soviet Union's large gold reserves would give it "great power to establish credibility." During the latter part of the 19th century, Russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than 100% of its outstanding currency, but no one outside Russia used rubles. 
09/wsj_0985:The Bank of England, on the other hand, had gold reserves that averaged about 30% of its outstanding currency, and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world.
09/wsj_0985:The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets, and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain.
09/wsj_0985:The success of the British gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law, rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency.
09/wsj_0985:It is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914, when the Bank of England was an independent private bank, the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended, but with the subsequent nationalization of the Bank of England, the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined. 
09/wsj_0985:One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws.
09/wsj_0985:Unless the laws determining the noteholder's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes, however, a gold-based ruble would be as unsuccessful for the Soviets as it was for the czars.

09/wsj_0987:Circuit breakers, designed to give the markets a breather in cases of sharp price movements, curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points.
09/wsj_0987:Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb "turmoil" in the marketplace.
09/wsj_0987:After the SEC study of the drop is completed, he said, "I'm perfectly happy to work with this committee . . . in identifying whether we need other devices," such as a program-trading curb. 
09/wsj_0987:Mr. Breeden backed most of the provisions in a market-reform bill that the SEC brought to the subcommittee last year under then-chairman David Ruder.
09/wsj_0987:But the new chairman vehemently opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress. 
09/wsj_0988:In a rare package sale of its real estate, K mart Corp., Troy, Mich., has sold 17 of its strip shopping centers to a limited partnership led by New York developer Philip Pilevsky, according to sources familiar with the transaction.
09/wsj_0988:They estimate the value of the transaction at close to $100 million. 
09/wsj_0988:It is unclear what effect the sale of the shopping centers will have on earnings. 
09/wsj_0988:The centers comprise a total of about 1.6 million square feet of retail space.
09/wsj_0989:So much of the stuff poured into its Austin, Texas, offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it.
09/wsj_0989:Now, thousands of mailers, catalogs and sales pitches go straight into the trash. 
09/wsj_0989:General Motors earlier this year said it wouldn't deliver bulk mail or free magazines in its Flint, Mich., office, while Air Products & Chemicals, Allentown, Pa., says it screens junk mail and often throws out most of a given mass mailing. 
09/wsj_0989:The direct-mail industry, not surprisingly, is fuming at the injustice of it all.
09/wsj_0989:After all, this is the industry that has a hard enough time getting any respect, that is the butt of so many jokes that television's "L.A.
09/wsj_0989:The practice of businesses throwing out junk mail "is a commonly known problem, and it's increasing as companies attempt to put through budget cuts across the board," right down to the mail-room level, says Stephen Belth, a list consultant and chairman of the Direct Marketing Association's business-to-business council. "But it's like biting the hand that feeds them, because every one of these companies uses direct marketing." 
09/wsj_0989:It's almost impossible to track the number of companies trashing junk mail, since the decision is usually made in the mail room -- not the board room.
09/wsj_0989:Motorola's Austin operation was one of the first to lose patience, deciding a few years ago to junk any bulk mail that wasn't addressed to an individual.
09/wsj_0989:At Air Products, meanwhile, the mailroom staff opens junk mail and often throws it away -- even if addressed to an individual. "If they get 50 packets of something, they open one, see what it says, throw 48 away and send two to people or departments they think are appropriate," a spokesman says. 
09/wsj_0989:Direct marketers were especially alarmed when General Motors -- one of the country's largest companies and a big direct-mail user itself -- entered the junk-mail battle.
09/wsj_0989:As of March 1, its Flint office, with about 2,500 employees, stopped delivering bulk mail and non-subscription magazines.
09/wsj_0989:The reason: overload, especially of non-subscription magazines. 
09/wsj_0989:Direct-mail executives see GM's stand as an ominous sign -- even if the junk-mail kings did bring it on themselves. "Why anyone would want to close themselves off {from direct mail}, a priori, doesn't make any sense," says Michael Bronner of Bronner Slosberg Associates, a Boston directmail firm. "It smacks of big brotherism.
09/wsj_0989:Among other things, the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on duplications. "We're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot smarter," says Jack Miller, president of Quill Corp., a Lincolnshire, Ill., business-to-business mail-order company.
09/wsj_0989:The ad campaign, created by Saatchi & Saatchi's Backer Spielvogel Bates agency, is an extension of the auto company's "Cars That Make Sense" campaign, which emphasized affordability.
09/wsj_0989:ACQUISITION: EWDB, formed by the merger of Eurocom and Della Femina McNamee WCRS, said it agreed to buy Vizeversa, an agency in Barcelona.

09/wsj_0990:Their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut, which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year, when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the House. 
09/wsj_0990:A major reason is that they believe the Packwood-Roth plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long run. 
09/wsj_0990:It also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes, including retirement, medical expenses, first-home purchases and tuition. 
09/wsj_0990:"A number of us are not going to touch capital gains, IRAs or anything else unless it contributes to deficit-reduction," said Sen. Charles Robb (D., Va.), who is one of the 10 to 20 Democrats who the Bush administration believes might favor giving preferential treatment to capital gains. 
09/wsj_0990:President Bush has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with Democratic senators at the White House.
09/wsj_0990:And at a luncheon meeting Tuesday of Democratic senators, there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains tax this year, according to participants. 
09/wsj_0990:The trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success. "There is a one-out-of-three shot of getting it this year," said Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, a leading Democratic proponent of cutting the capital-gains tax.
09/wsj_0990:The IRA portion (of the Packwood-Roth plan) is irresponsible." 
09/wsj_0990:Estimates requested by Sen. Mitchell from the Congressional Joint Taxation Committee show that the richest 100 taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains differential of $13 million each in 1985, the last year for which figures are available. 
09/wsj_0990:As a result, the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with Senate Democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut. 
09/wsj_0990:Democrats asked in this week for discussions with President Bush have suggested ways of "tinkering" with the Packwood-Roth proposal, suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back, one official said. 
09/wsj_0990:In addition, White House aides think that there are numerous other important measures Democrats badly wanted passed -- such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly -- that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with Democrats.
09/wsj_0990:If they can't secure immediate passage of a capital-gains plan, administration officials also aren't ruling out making a deal with Congress to put off a vote until a firm date in the future, even next year.
09/wsj_0990:Japanese immigration authorities said they found 658 more Chinese among Vietnamese boat people, bringing the number of Chinese trying to enter Japan by posing as Vietnamese refugees this year to 1,642. 
09/wsj_0990:The Chinese were among 3,372 boat people supposedly from Vietnam who arrived in Japan this year, compared with 219 for all of 1988, the official said. 
09/wsj_0990:On Sept. 13, Japan began a policy of screening boat people, accepting only those deemed to be political refugees. 
09/wsj_0990:Francoise Verne, 52-year-old former deputy director of France's mint, faces prison for her theft of some 67 rare coins from the mint's collections.
09/wsj_0990:Before an inventory in 1984 that showed the "disappearance" of 944 coins valued at about 2.9 million French francs (about $465,000), there hadn't been any stock-taking since 1868.
09/wsj_0990:Tony Lambert, Mrs. Verne's successor, says the mint's losses from the theft run into the hundreds of thousands of francs. 
09/wsj_0990:El Salvador is destroying more than 1.6 million pounds of food that had rotted in government warehouses, government officials said.

09/wsj_0990:A black-draped cruise liner sailed into Naples yesterday bringing 800 Libyans threatening vengeance if Italy refuses to pay compensation for more than 30 years of colonial rule.
09/wsj_0990:Another 250 Libyans were already in Italy to stage a day of mourning for victims of Italy's colonial rule between 1911 and 1943, when Tripoli says Rome kidnapped 5,000 Libyans and deported them as forced labor.
09/wsj_0990:Representatives of the Inuit and Cree peoples living in Quebec and Labrador in northeastern Canada told the ministry of the planned action at a meeting, a ministry spokesman said.

09/wsj_0990:Located six miles northeast of Venice, the field contains 875 billion cubic feet of methane gas-one-tenth of Italy's reserves. 
09/wsj_0990:The council unanimously opposed the idea of AGIP pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has yet to reply. 
09/wsj_0990:The vehicle has a top speed of 65 miles an hour and requires recharging from a standard wall socket every 100 miles. 
09/wsj_0991:Total Assets Protection Inc., rebounding from its earlier loss, expects to report earnings from operations of about $200,000 for the third quarter, J.C. Matlock, chairman, said. 
09/wsj_0991:Net income includes an extraordinary gain of about $100,000 from the reversal of bad debt and interest income.
09/wsj_0991:In the 1988 third quarter, the company posted a net loss of $876,706, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of about $5.1 million. 
09/wsj_0992:The institute's advocacy efforts are based on the needs of the population it serves and represents. 
09/wsj_0992:In 1985, the Medical Tribune reported that a growing number of critics are challenging the FDA bioequivalence-therapeutic-equivalence equation. "They contend it is based on an assumption that has not yet been proven in valid tests," the Tribune said. 
09/wsj_0992:In 1986, some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched from a specific brand-name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another.
09/wsj_0992:The institute has governmental service contracts for the provision of direct patient services; collects patient fees; receives money through contributions from individuals, foundations and bequests.
09/wsj_0992:The Epilepsy Institute's reporting of breakthrough seizures stemmed from concerns about the people we treat and care about daily.
09/wsj_0992:But let us not confuse profits of big business masquerading as concerns for people's health care or for the cost.

09/wsj_0994:Visitors, whisked from the Strip on a moving walkway, will glide over a habitat for rare white tigers, which will star in performances by the famed illusionist team of Siegfried & Roy.
09/wsj_0994:At the core of all this stands a hotel.
09/wsj_0994:In the lobby behind its nine-story, orchid-strewn atrium, a 20,000-gallon aquarium will come alive with sharks, stingrays, angelfish, puffers and other creatures of the deep. 
09/wsj_0994:There's a casino, the financial heart of it all. 
09/wsj_0994:It's the most stunning example of Las Vegas's concerted effort to transform itself into a world-famous vacation resort for families as well as gamblers.
09/wsj_0994:Stephen A. Wynn, who owns 29.4% of Golden Nugget's shares, says the Mirage and other projects will help Las Vegas attract a whole new generation of visitors. "If you create a wonderment, if you create something so exciting that the public dreams of being part of it, then they'll come," he says.
09/wsj_0994:The projects already under construction will increase Las Vegas's supply of hotel rooms by 11,795, or nearly 20%, to 75,500.
09/wsj_0994:By a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each new hotel room, Clark County will have nearly 18,000 new jobs.
09/wsj_0994:The county at the end of 1988 had 307,000 jobs, 95,400 of them in the tourist industry.
09/wsj_0994:Hotel-casino operators play down the possibility of a labor shortage.
09/wsj_0994:Nobody yet seems to have calculated the total number of slot machines, crap tables or roulette wheels Las Vegas will add to the enormous store that Lady Luck already guards here, much less the ultimate impact of the growth on schools and municipal services. 
09/wsj_0994:"Traffic is certainly a concern, as is pollution, water and an adequate labor market," says Frank Sain, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau.
09/wsj_0994:City fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth, such as the expansion of McCarran International Airport to accommodate the 44% of Las Vegas tourists who fly here.
09/wsj_0994:This year, by one means of transport or another, more than 18 million people will visit the city. 
09/wsj_0994:Amid a riot of jousting knights, circus clowns, gold-leaf centurions and creatures of the wild, lesser competitors will fall. 
09/wsj_0994:Caesars World Inc. plans to defend its august reputation by sinking $190 million into its opulent Caesars Palace, next door to the new Mirage, and adding a $100 million shopping area reminiscent of Rodeo Drive.
09/wsj_0994:The Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace, Frontier and others are pouring millions of dollars into facelifts, new room towers and casino floor space just to keep up. 
09/wsj_0994:Where's this huge amount of investment capital coming from?
09/wsj_0994:Golden Nugget, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's first casino client, has borrowed on more than $600 million worth of mortgage notes, mostly sold to private investors by Drexel, to build the Mirage.
09/wsj_0994:Other casino owners, Circus Circus among them, are financing their expansion with their own cash and revolving credit lines from local lenders such as First Interstate Bank of Nevada. 
09/wsj_0994:The growth of Las Vegas tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they will.
09/wsj_0994:"If you build a better mousetrap, it will catch more mice," says Fred Benninger, chairman of MGM Grand.
09/wsj_0994:"Two generations ago, Dad came to Las Vegas by himself for a little diversion," says Van Heffner, executive vice president of the Nevada Hotel and Motel Association. "One generation ago, Mom joined Dad.
09/wsj_0994:Despite the new emphasis on the family trade, however, tourists in search of naughtier fun than gambling seem certain to find it, with Las Vegas call girls remaining on the scene. 
09/wsj_0994:For now, however, the naysayers' voices are drowned by the roar of cement mixers and the clanging of construction cranes along the Strip.
09/wsj_0994:Some have bought big chunks of Strip property for what may turn into another wave of building.
09/wsj_0994:Many blue-collar customers of downtown's no-frills gambling spots have been lured to the Strip or to Laughlin, Nev., a Colorado River town catering to snowbirds and the recreational-vehicle crowd.
09/wsj_0994:Hotel expansion and an influx of more-discriminating tourists have hurt motels.
09/wsj_0994:Since 1979, the number of motel rooms has fallen by 17,000. 
09/wsj_0994:Any hotel-casino without a strong identity will get whacked by the new competition, says Glenn Schaeffer, senior vice president of Circus Circus. "If you don't know what you are, bigger won't make you better," he says. "But it'll sure make you poorer." 
09/wsj_0994:Circus Circus's flagship casino has become the envy of competitors for its ability to vacuum cash from the pockets of vacationing families.
09/wsj_0994:The company's Excalibur will also appeal to families, of course.
09/wsj_0994:Its castle, Mr. Schaeffer says, will be "the most compelling piece of folk architecture ever built." 
09/wsj_0994:While his company's hotel is building a retail complex in Beverly Hills style and redoing existing rooms, it has decreased the number of its rooms.
09/wsj_0994:Caesars has made a specialty of catering to high rollers from abroad, who are also being aggressively courted by the Mirage, the Las Vegas Hilton and others.
09/wsj_0994:Other, smaller concerns are also pursuing market niches -- Hawaiian tourists, for example, or the local trade. "There's still room for boutique properties," says James Barrett, president of MarCor Resorts Inc. Off the Strip, MarCor is building the Rio, a hotel-casino with a Brazilian theme and only 430 rooms -- all of them suites. 
09/wsj_0994:Despite the proliferation of tourist distractions, Las Vegans haven't forgot that gambling is still what the town is all about. "The days when when the thrust of casinos was all high rollers, with no windows and clocks and lots of red and black decor, are gone," Mr. Sain of the visitors' bureau says. "But 93% of tourists still come for gambling.
09/wsj_0994:We can't lose sight of that." 
09/wsj_0995:NORTH SIDE SAVINGS BANK directors declared an initial dividend of 10 cents a share, payable Dec. 5 to stock of record Nov. 21.

09/wsj_0996:If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. . . .

09/wsj_0996:Mr. Glazier discovered that the Founders had worried that Congress might take the President out of the loop.
09/wsj_0996:Labeling an omnibus budget a "bill" can't deprive the President of his power to veto items. 
09/wsj_0996:Congress inserted the following into the Interior appropriation: "None of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the Dept. of the Interior and Members and committees of Congress and their staff." 
09/wsj_0996:The White House warned that this would be an unconstitutional usurpation of its power.
09/wsj_0996:The fear Congress has of any line-item-veto test led Members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year, "This section shall be effective only on Oct. 1, 1989." This means Interior contacts cannot be logged only on one day -- a Sunday that had already passed. 
09/wsj_0996:Commenting on the budget mess this week, President Bush said: "The perception out there is that it's the fault of Congress.
09/wsj_0996:And you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the American people." Exactly right.
09/wsj_0996:Congress may have lost any sense of discipline, but that doesn't mean the country must learn to live forever with this mess.
09/wsj_0997:Troubled SCI Television Inc. proposed to restructure much of its $1.3 billion in debt to buy time to sell assets and pay its obligations. 
09/wsj_0997:The leveraged buy-out firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which owns 46% of the common equity of SCI TV, indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce its equity stake to 15%, giving the rest of its stake to bondholders in the restructuring. 
09/wsj_0997:KKR also signaled to the company's creditors that Henry Kravis and other KKR directors of SCI TV would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed and forgo their voting rights. 
09/wsj_0997:Holders of SCI TV's $507 million of high-yield junk bonds are being asked to forgive a lot of debt in exchange for taking a 39% equity stake in SCI TV.
09/wsj_0997:"I think the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number of bondholders' eyes that substantial revisions will be required to get it done," says analyst Craig Davis of R.D. Smith & Co. here. 
09/wsj_0997:Investors interpreted the KKR move as a desire by the firm to wash its hands of SCI TV.
09/wsj_0997:KKR already has made about $1 billion of gains from earlier transactions with SCI TV, thus it isn't significantly affected by the company's troubles. 
09/wsj_0997:It is having trouble meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in 1987 for a leveraged buy-out. 
09/wsj_0997:Through investment banker Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., SCI TV is offering to exchange three classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors value at ranges from 20 cents to 70 cents on the dollar.
09/wsj_0997:SCI TV's debt restructuring plan would defer payment of $153 million of bank debt.
09/wsj_0997:Yet to pay that interest bill, analysts say SCI TV will only produce about $80 million to $90 million of cash flow a year. 
09/wsj_0998:THE NORTHEAST office market is feeling serious aftereffects of the giddy overbuilding of the 1980s. 
09/wsj_0998:Foreclosures and other signs of financial distress, most often associated with the real estate market in the Southwest, are surfacing in the suburban office market of the once thriving Northeast. 
09/wsj_0998:Some projects are now in the hands of lenders, including a 425,000-square-foot office facility in Little Falls, N.J.
09/wsj_0998:The owners of a 32-acre hotel and office complex in King of Prussia, Pa., have advertised for new financing.
09/wsj_0998:And in suburban Boston, developers are bracing for cutbacks in the computer industry, a major user of office space. 
09/wsj_0998:Many troubled properties haven't been foreclosed on and are hard to identify, says Albert I. Berger, who heads the Secaucus, N.J., office of Helmsley-Spear Inc., a real estate brokerage.
09/wsj_0998:Owners are voluntarily -- and quietly -- turning over properties to lenders through "deeds in lieu of foreclosure." Often, developers stay on as property manager. 
09/wsj_0998:The Japanese company hired Richardson Nagy Martin, a Newport Beach, Calif., architectural firm, to design what the Japanese press has dubbed "the Beverly Hills of Tokyo." Instead of Japan's typical small homes clustered on narrow streets with no sidewalks, the new "One Hundred Hills" development will offer 65 houses on half-acre lots.
09/wsj_0998:Exteriors are faced with brick, wood or stone, but the homes are made of steel-reinforced concrete. "We were disappointed we couldn't use wood," says architect Walter J. Richardson, "but the Japanese only want stronger materials." At $1,000 per square foot, the Japanese want the feeling of indestructibility, he explains, not to mention protection from possible earthquake damage. 
09/wsj_0998:"One of the difficulties people in real estate have is that each product is like starting a new company, or starting a new line in the fashion business," says L. Robert Lieb president of Mountain Development Corp. in West Paterson, N.J.
09/wsj_0998:Weingarten-Siegel Group Inc. of Manalapan, N.J., has built Cross Creek Pointe, Allegro Pointe and other Pointes in New Jersey.
09/wsj_0998:Caspi Development Corp of Armonk, N.Y., has developed two apartment buildings called Classic and plans a third.
09/wsj_0998:Developer Steve Caspi says the same brand name indicates consistent quality, "regardless of location, design or amenities." 
09/wsj_0998:Because of standardized designs, Mr. Hovnanian says, "a buyer can visualize Society Hill regardless of where it is." 
09/wsj_0998:THE EARTHQUAKE in San Francisco has sent few tremors through the hearts of real estate investors. 
09/wsj_0998:"I think there's a disease called buyer's regret, and I'm sure it's running rampant at this moment, but it gets cured in a short period of time," says Kenneth Leventhal, co-managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal & Co,. a Los Angeles accounting firm specializing in real estate. "If I were buying a building in San Francisco now the first thing I'd do is insist on a structural inspection, then I'd delay a little, stall a little." 
09/wsj_0998:Still, local builders are eager to tell the world that most of San Francisco doesn't look like the TV images of destruction.
09/wsj_0998:Planners of the Urban Land Institute real estate conference this week hastily added a panel on the quake's effects. "The message is we build'em right," says Peter Bedford, a California developer and officer at Urban Land Institute. "There's seven million square feet of space that's doing great." 
09/wsj_0999:Although their ads picture curvy young people in skimpy outfits, club owners know the future lies with the lumpier over-40 set. "It's a misconception that physical fitness is something for the young and middle-aged," says Michael Pacholik, sales manager of the LA Fitness club, Diamond Bar, Calif.
09/wsj_0999:About 10% to 15% of members at Atlanta's Holiday Espre Center are elderly, says Gerald Williams, fitness consultant. "Most want cardiovascular conditioning . . . the No. 1 way of reducing risk of heart disease." 
09/wsj_0999:The Association of Quality Clubs, which puts 1988 industry revenue at $5 billion, surveyed the health-conscious over-40 market and found that 43% exercise regularly.
09/wsj_0999:Michael Hays, head of ProBody Fitness, notes an industry "wash" is in progress. "Clubs need to be run like restaurants where every square foot makes a dollar," he says.
09/wsj_0999:"HOT" TOPAZ sparks regulator, jeweler concern over import of irradiated stones. 
09/wsj_0999:A committee of gem dealers investigates the source of some "hot" blue topaz stones recently reported by a Hong Kong jewelry manufacturer.
09/wsj_0999:"The {stones} that were irradiated in the U.S. are safe," says John Hickey, chief of the NRC operations branch, Washington. "We believe that the vast majority of imported material is safe.
09/wsj_0999:But there is a small risk that some were imported with high radiation levels." Mr. Hickey added that the stones found in Hong Kong are thought to carry double the U.S. radiation limit, although he noted that double or even triple the U.S. limit is "still in the range of safe levels." Some jewelers have Geiger counters to measure topaz radiation. 
09/wsj_0999:Family-owned firms that need cash to grow are attractive, says John Turner of Matuschka Gruppe, Munich.

09/wsj_0999:The FCC plans to hear a day of testimony Nov. 16 on the plight of AM radio.
09/wsj_0999:The National Association of Broadcasters in June adopted an agenda for revitalizing AM radio that includes, among other things, pursuing further FCC action on selecting an AM stereo standard and seeking a law requiring all stereo receivers to include AM stereo.

10/wsj_1000:Kemper Financial Services Inc., charging that program trading is ruining the stock market, cut off four big Wall Street firms from doing any of its stock-trading business. 
10/wsj_1000:The move is the biggest salvo yet in the renewed outcry against program trading, with Kemper putting its money -- the millions of dollars in commissions it generates each year -- where its mouth is. 
10/wsj_1000:But most of them, led by Morgan Stanley & Co., moved back in earlier this year.
10/wsj_1000:The most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire, computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options.
10/wsj_1000:Index arbitrage recently has accounted for about half of all program trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
10/wsj_1000:Last month, program trading accounted for 20.9 million shares a day, or a record 13.8% of the Big Board's average daily volume. 
10/wsj_1000:On Tuesday afternoon, Kemper told Bear, Stearns & Co., General Electric Co. 's Kidder, Peabody & Co. unit, Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer & Co. that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage, officials inside and outside these firms confirmed.
10/wsj_1000:Kemper officials declined to identify the firms but acknowledged a long-simmering dispute with four securities firms and said the list of brokers it won't do business with may be lengthened in the months ahead. 
10/wsj_1000:"We've been opposed to" index arbitrage "for a long time," said Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer at Kemper, which manages $56 billion, including $8 billion of stocks. "Index arbitrage doesn't work, and it scares natural buyers" of stock. 
10/wsj_1000:While Mr. Timbers explained he's "not totally convinced index arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock market," he said that "on an intraday basis, it has major effects.
10/wsj_1000:We've talked to proponents of index arbitrage and told them to cool it because they're ruining the market.
10/wsj_1000:Kemper also blasted the Big Board for ignoring the interests of individual and institutional holders. "The New York Stock Exchange has vested interests" in its big member securities firms "that cloud its objectivity," Mr. Timbers said. "It has never been interested in what we think.
10/wsj_1000:Small investors perceive that "big operators" dominate the market, said Thomas O'Hara, chairman of the National Association of Investors and head of the exchange's Individual Investors Advisory Committee set up after the 1987 crash. "The impression I've got is they'd love to do away with it {program trading}, but they {the exchange} can't do it," he said. 
10/wsj_1000:Mr. Timbers countered that "the mere fact they put in circuit breakers is an admission of their problems." 
10/wsj_1000:According to Lawrence Eckenfelder, a securities industry analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., "Kemper is the first firm to make a major statement with program trading." He added that "having just one firm do this isn't going to mean a hill of beans.

10/wsj_1002:At a time when Jon Levy should be planning the biggest spring season in his dress company's 17 years, his work day is studded with intense moments of concern about one of his biggest customers, Campeau Corp. 
10/wsj_1002:"The dress business has always been a gamble, but it's never been like this," says Mr. Levy, president of St. Gillian Group Ltd., which has become a hot name thanks to a campaign of sexy TV commercials. 
10/wsj_1002:Campeau, owner of such retailers as Bloomingdale's, Bon Marche, and Jordan Marsh, sidestepped financial collapse last month after an emergency $250 million loan from Olympia & York Developments Ltd., a Canadian developer and a major shareholder in Campeau.
10/wsj_1002:The risk of doing business with Campeau's Federated and Allied department store chains is about to increase greatly, not only for Mr. Levy but for hundreds of other small apparel makers, button suppliers, trucking firms and fabric houses. 
10/wsj_1002:Next week, the country's top designers and manufacturers will begin showing fashions for spring 1990, the second most important selling season of the year.
10/wsj_1002:This is no longer true because of Campeau's massive debt load. 
10/wsj_1002:"The few million dollars I could lose today is nothing against what I could lose on the spring line," says Mr. Levy, who estimates that Campeau stores will sell $25 million worth of his clothes this year. "I'm buying fabric right now for clothes which I may not be paid for until April or May.
10/wsj_1002:Other credit houses, such as Credit Exchange and Solo Credit Service Corp., are suggesting that their clients study each order before shipping. "Payments are good right now, but we aren't recommending any long-term lines of credit," says Richard Hastings, a retail credit analyst, referring to credit lines which make inventory purchases automatic. "The Campeau situation is a little uncertain and very difficult to analyze." 
10/wsj_1002:Because of those concerns, some manufacturers say they will ask for letters of credit before shipping spring merchandise. "We're being paid today, but we're worried about tomorrow and will want" letters of credit, says the sales director at one major dress maker who asked not to be identified. 
10/wsj_1002:Howard Bloom, president of the dress firm Chetta B Inc., says: "It's big time chaos today.
10/wsj_1002:Carol Sanger, vice president, corporate communications at Campeau, says that all of the Federated and Allied chains are paying their bills in a timely manner. "They continue to pay their bills and will do so," says Ms. Sanger. "We're confident we'll be paying our bills for spring merchandise as well." 
10/wsj_1002:"Everybody is worried about the possibility of cancellations," says Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. "The buyers who work for the various Campeau chains may lose their jobs.
10/wsj_1002:This includes a working capital facility for Allied Stores of $350 million that matures March 15, 1990, and an $800 million bridge loan due April 30, 1990.
10/wsj_1002:Those filings, plus the expected sale of a number of financially healthy chains, such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field's and Bloomingdale's, have added to the anxiety. 
10/wsj_1002:"Right now, Federated owes us a considerable amount of money," says Morris Marmalstein, president of David Warren Enterprises, a major dress manufacturer. "We expect they will be current with their debts by the end of the week, but we are considering asking them for letters of credit before we take more orders." 
10/wsj_1002:Mr. Marmalstein adds that his company is now holding some goods in anticipation of being paid in full. "It's become a day-by-day business," he says. "Business has never been this tough before.
10/wsj_1002:Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller Inc., says his company is now shipping only to the flagship stores of the Federated and Allied chains.
10/wsj_1002:"The branches are just warmed over, empty halls," says Mr. Konheim. "Why should I be part of that problem?
10/wsj_1002:Campeau's Ms. Sanger disputes Mr. Konheim's comments. "Many of the branches are very lucrative," she says. "That's just nonsense." 
10/wsj_1003:Separately, two more of the nation's top steelmakers -- Armco Inc. and National Intergroup Inc. -- reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses, marking what is generally believed to be the end of a two-year boom in the industry. 
10/wsj_1003:Wall Street analysts expect the disappointing trend to continue into the fourth quarter and through at least the first two quarters of 1990, when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product lines, such as rolled sheet used for cars, appliances and construction. 
10/wsj_1003:In fact, he thinks several steelmakers will report actual losses through the third quarter of 1990. 
10/wsj_1003:In the year-ago period, Bethlehem earned $101.4 million, or $1.27 a share, including a $3.8 million gain from early retirement of debt. 
10/wsj_1003:Of all the major steelmakers, Bethlehem would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown.
10/wsj_1003:However, in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume, Bethlehem "had pretty good earnings numbers," said Michelle Galanter Applebaum, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. Ms. Applebaum had estimated third-quarter earnings of 55 cents a share, but said the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected. 
10/wsj_1003:The company said its shipments declined as a result of a reduction in inventories by service centers, a lackluster automotive market and increasing competitive pressures in the construction market. 
10/wsj_1003:He noted, however, that the company's order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer, following the end of labor negotiations. 
10/wsj_1003:Along with reduced volume, analysts said the nation's fifth largest steelmaker was hurt by holding higher-cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped.
10/wsj_1003:National Intergroup, which owns 50% of the nation's sixth largest steelmaker -- National Steel Corp. -- posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $8.6 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $50.3 million.
10/wsj_1003:The latest period includes gains of $9.1 million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward.
10/wsj_1003:The company noted that its Fox-Meyer Drug Co., Ben Franklin Stores Inc. and Permian Corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves.
10/wsj_1003:However, its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $6.3 million from $10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike.
10/wsj_1003:National Intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50% interest in National Steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations. 
10/wsj_1004:International Business Machines Corp. said it agreed to let Motorola Inc. participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry. 
10/wsj_1004:IBM, which made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here, said it invited many other companies to participate as well, including some from Europe.
10/wsj_1004:While IBM, Armonk, N.Y., makes the bulk of the DRAMs it uses, it doesn't make the equipment needed to produce those chips.
10/wsj_1004:Failure of U.S. equipment makers, IBM fears, would leave it dependent on many of the Japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market. 
10/wsj_1004:A state-of-the-art plant cost $40 million in the mid-1970s but costs $500 million today because the technology is so complex.
10/wsj_1004:The project involving Motorola concerns a technique, called X-ray lithography, that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips. 
10/wsj_1004:But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine, and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too blurry -- much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one.
10/wsj_1004:But, assuming those problems can be overcome, they should allow for memory chips that could approach one billion bits of information -- 250 times as much as is contained in the four-megabit chips that are just reaching the market and a million times what was possible in the mid-1970s. 
10/wsj_1005:The airborne system operates independent of ground-based radar systems, informing pilots of nearby aircraft, Allied-Signal said.
10/wsj_1005:Allied-Signal is a unit of Allied-Signal Inc., a manufacturer with interests in aerospace, automotive products and engineered materials.
10/wsj_1005:Continental Airlines is a unit of Texas Air Corp., Houston. 
10/wsj_1006:The non-food operations accounted for about 27% of Provigo's 7.38 billion Canadian dollars (US$6.3 billion) in sales in the latest fiscal year. 
10/wsj_1006:Bertin Nadeau, newly appointed chairman and interim chief executive of Provigo, wouldn't say if Mr. Lortie was asked to leave. "Mr.
10/wsj_1006:Lortie felt less pertinent," Mr. Nadeau said, given the decision to dump Provigo's non-food operations. "At this stage it was felt I was perhaps more pertinent as chief executive." Mr. Nadeau also is chairman and chief executive of Unigesco Inc., Provigo's controlling shareholder. 
10/wsj_1006:At a news conference, Mr. Nadeau said the sale of the three non-food businesses, which account for nearly half the company's C$900 million in assets, should be completed in a "matter of months." The three units are a nationwide pharmaceutical and health-products distributor, a small sporting-goods chain, and a combination catalog showroom and toy-store chain. 
10/wsj_1006:"I think it's a pretty positive development," said Ross Cowan, a financial analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc., of the decision to concentrate on groceries.
10/wsj_1006:Mr. Lortie's departure, while sudden, was seen as inevitable in light of the shift in strategy. "The non-food operations were largely Mr. Lortie's creation {and} his strategy didn't work," said Steven Holt, a financial analyst with Midland Doherty Ltd. 
10/wsj_1006:For the six months ended Aug. 12, Provigo posted net income of C$6.5 million, or eight Canadian cents a share, compared with C$18.1 million, or 21 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier.
10/wsj_1006:Last month, Canadian Bond Rating Service downgraded Provigo's commercial paper and debentures because of its lackluster performance. 
10/wsj_1006:Mr. Nadeau said discussions are under way with potential purchasers of each of the units.
10/wsj_1006:He declined to confirm or deny reports that Provigo executive Henri Roy is trying to put together a management buy-out of the catalogue showroom unit.
10/wsj_1006:Yvon Bussieres was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of Provigo, a new position.
10/wsj_1006:Mr. Bussieres was president and chief operating officer of Provigo's Quebec retail and wholesale grocery unit.
10/wsj_1007:Foreign-exchange dealers noted that the impact of the chairman's remarks was slight and warned that the currency remains sensitive to developments on Wall Street. 
10/wsj_1007:Testifying before a panel of the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said the short-term value of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets isn't the primary policy focus of the central bank. 
10/wsj_1007:"Our essential focus is on domestic policy," Mr. Greenspan said, referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy. 
10/wsj_1007:In perhaps his most telling remark, Mr. Greenspan termed the current U.S. inflation rate of around 4.5% as "much too high to be ignored." 
10/wsj_1007:The dollar climbed immediately higher on news of Mr. Greenspan's testimony, settling lower in later trade as dealers squared positions ahead of today's preliminary report on third-quarter U.S. gross national product. 
10/wsj_1007:In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.60 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 141.55 yen. 
10/wsj_1007:Many traders forecast a continuation of the market's recent bearish trend and predict the U.S. currency will remain stuck in its relatively narrow ranges in the near term and then shift lower. 
10/wsj_1007:But according to Doug Madison, a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles, a large number of short positions must first be corrected, spurring a temporary upswing, before the unit can turn lower. 
10/wsj_1007:He predicts a downward move in dollar-mark trade and a less dramatic slip in dollar-yen, noting that there continues to be a large pool of Japanese investor interest in U.S. securities, which could provide a solid base for the dollar at around 140 yen. 
10/wsj_1007:Some analysts reckon that the next quarter's figures will present a more accurate picture of the U.S. economy, showing a marked slowdown in a number of sectors, including housing starts and equities. 
10/wsj_1008:Lawrence Insurance Group Inc. said it acquired United Republic Reinsurance Co., a Houston property and casualty reinsurance company, from United Savings Association of Texas for $28 million. 
10/wsj_1008:Lawrence Insurance also sold 3.2 million of its shares for $7.125 each to its parent, Lawrence Group Inc. Lawrence Insurance, based in Albany, N.Y., plans to use the $22.5 million in proceeds to help finance the acquisition of United Republic. 
10/wsj_1008:A reinsurance company effectively insures insurance companies that wish to spread the risk of a particular policy. 
10/wsj_1009:Levi Strauss Associates Inc., the closely held owner of Levi Strauss & Co., said its fiscal third-quarter earnings jumped to $128.6 million from $31.3 million a year earlier, aided by a $69.8 million gain from the sale of stock in a Japanese subsidiary. 
10/wsj_1009:The apparel holding company had sales in the quarter ended Aug. 27 of $1 billion, up 12% from $908.8 million a year ago. 
10/wsj_1009:The company said its quarterly results are now being publicly filed as the result of the formation earlier this year of employee stock investment plans. 
10/wsj_1010:Some people familiar with the situation believe that the collapse of the previous $6.79 billion buy-out, if anything, may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups.
10/wsj_1010:"United pilots have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike," said an executive at Fuji Bank, one of UAL's large lenders. "If you have both {labor} groups on strike, you've got no revenue and that's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at." 
10/wsj_1010:That gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work. 
10/wsj_1010:Thus, even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key. "There's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions' cooperation and wage concessions," said Richard Nye, of Baker, Nye Investments, a New York takeover stock-trader.
10/wsj_1010:At the very least, the pilots want some form of control over the airline, perhaps through super-majority voting rights. 
10/wsj_1010:Mr. Freeman said machinists' union advisers plan to meet this week to try to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization that could include a special dividend for shareholders, an employee stake and, perhaps, an equity investment by a friendly investor. 
10/wsj_1010:If a compromise can't be reached, the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists.
10/wsj_1010:The pilots' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve. "Who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots' union?" asks Candace Browning, an analyst at Wertheim Schroeder & Co. "Who would the board be working for -- the public shareholders or the pilots?" she adds. 
10/wsj_1010:Another possibility is for the pilots' to team up with an outside investor who might try to force the ouster of the board through the solicitation of consents.
10/wsj_1010:But again, they may need the help of the machinists. 
10/wsj_1010:"I think the dynamics of this situation are that something's got to happen," said one official familiar with the situation.
10/wsj_1011:The Atlanta-based airline, the third largest in the U.S., attributed the increase to higher passenger traffic, new international routes and reduced service by rival Eastern Airlines, which is in bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of a strike that began last spring. 
10/wsj_1011:For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Delta posted net income of $133.1 million, or $2.53 a share, up from $100 million, or $2.03 a share, a year earlier. 
10/wsj_1011:During the quarter, Delta issued 2.5 million shares of common stock to Swissair, and repurchased 1.1 million shares for use in a company employee stock ownership plan. 
10/wsj_1011:Delta has benefited more than other carriers from the weakness of Eastern Airlines, which shares the Atlanta hub.
10/wsj_1011:Although Eastern is back to about 80% of its pre-strike schedule now, the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary was only beginning to get back on its feet during the quarter. 
10/wsj_1011:The latest results include a $2.6 million one-time payment from a "foreign entity." America West wouldn't identify the entity, but said the payment was for the foreign company's use of certain tax benefits in connection with America West plane purchases.
10/wsj_1011:Year-earlier results included an extraordinary gain of $1.6 million from a buy-back of convertible subordinated debentures. 
10/wsj_1011:For the nine months, America West posted earnings of $18.9 million, or 97 cents a share, compared with a loss of $9.7 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier.
10/wsj_1012:The four-page news summary will be aimed at readers outside Canada or in Canadian locations where the national daily isn't available on the day of publication.
10/wsj_1012:WHO'S NEWS: Michael T. Carr, advertising director of Playboy magazine, was named publisher of National Lampoon and Heavy Metal magazines, succeeding George Agoglia.
10/wsj_1012:It was the first management change since film-makers Daniel Grodnik and Tim Matheson took control of National Lampoon Inc. in March.
10/wsj_1013:Columbia Savings & Loan Association, reeling from thrift-accounting changes mandated by Congress and the recent collapse of the junk-bond market, announced a loss for the third quarter of $226.3 million, or $11.57 a share. 
10/wsj_1013:For the quarter a year ago, Columbia reported earnings of $16.3 million, or 37 cents a share.
10/wsj_1013:The loss stems from $357.5 million of write-downs on Columbia's $4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio, which includes about $3.7 billion of junk bonds, $400 million of preferred stock, and Treasury securities. 
10/wsj_1013:Columbia owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio, the largest of any U.S. thrift.
10/wsj_1013:Much of Columbia's junk-bond trading has been done through the high-yield department of its Beverly Hills neighbor, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
10/wsj_1013:For the nine months, losses totaled $212 million, or $10.83 a share, compared with net income of $48.7 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier. 
10/wsj_1013:The results include a $130.2 million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value. 
10/wsj_1013:Columbia also added $227.3 million to reserves for losses on the portfolio, increasing general reserves to $300 million, or about 6.7% of the total portfolio, as of Sept. 30.
10/wsj_1013:Thrift officials said the $300 million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of dispositions and market conditions. 
10/wsj_1013:Previously, Columbia didn't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices, because it held the bonds as long-term investments.
10/wsj_1013:Because Columbia now must sell the bonds within five years, accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices. 
10/wsj_1013:Thomas Spiegel, Columbia's chairman, said in a statement that the thrift was "disappointed" by the effects of the accounting changes.
10/wsj_1013:But he said Columbia remains "one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry," based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital. 
10/wsj_1013:Columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market.
10/wsj_1013:The price of Columbia shares has been cut nearly in half since August, when they traded at about $10, as investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down.
10/wsj_1013:The stock's decline accelerated in the past two weeks, from a price of $8 a share on Oct. 9. 
10/wsj_1013:Columbia officials said they don't know how quickly they will dispose of the thrift's junk bonds, because federal regulations, such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries, haven't yet been completed. 
10/wsj_1013:Its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of Sept. 30 was 3.6%, and total equity was $457.9 million. 
10/wsj_1013:The thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs, which has a book value of $90 million. 
10/wsj_1013:Although many of the transactions related to those securities haven't been completed, Columbia said the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from $200 million to $300 million.
10/wsj_1013:Columbia also has unrealized gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than $70 million. 
10/wsj_1014:Anheuser, the world's largest brewer and U.S. market leader, has historically been reluctant to engage in price-cutting as a means of boosting sales volume.
10/wsj_1014:With the passing of the heady days of swelling industry sales, however, the once-sporadic and brief forays into discounting are becoming standard competitive weapons in the beer industry. 
10/wsj_1014:The St. Louis company said major rivals, Philip Morris Co. 's Miller Brewing unit and Adolph Coors Co. "have been following a policy of continuous and deep discounting for at least the past 18 months" on their premium brands, pricing their product as much as 25 cents a 12-pack below Anheuser's Budweiser label in many markets.
10/wsj_1014:Anheuser said its new strategy -- started in some markets last month and expected to be applied soon in selected markets nationwide -- will mean lower-than-anticipated earnings for the last half of 1989 and for 1990.
10/wsj_1014:The stock closed at $38.50 on heavy volume of about 3.5 million shares.
10/wsj_1014:Shares of Coors, the company's sole publicly traded major competitor, fell $1.50 apiece to $19.125 in national over-the-counter trading, apparently on investor concerns over potential fallout from the coming pricing struggle. 
10/wsj_1014:Anheuser noted that "beer industry sales volume is 1989 is following the trend that has characterized the last half of the '80s, with sales volume being essentially flat" while consolidation creates fewer, bigger players. 
10/wsj_1014:Anheuser said it continues to hold to its earlier-announced goal of a 50% U.S. market share by the mid-1990s. 
10/wsj_1014:Beneath the tepid news-release jargon lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant, which last year accounted for about 41% of all U.S. beer sales and is expected to see that grow to 42.5% in the current year. "Anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar, and he just decided to join in the barroom brawl," said Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "It's going to get bloody." 
10/wsj_1014:Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketers Insights, a trade newsletter, said Anheuser's announcement means "everybody else in the industry is going to have a difficult time reaching their profit objectives." 
10/wsj_1014:Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst George E. Thompson downplayed the importance of the announcement, and called any comparison between the coming beer-industry tiff and the seemingly unending "cola wars," unwarranted.
10/wsj_1014:Mr. Thompson calls discounting "a loser's game for anyone without a dominant market share," and projected that Anheuser's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on price-cutting or face a costly and fruitless battle. 
10/wsj_1014:Mr. Thompson noted that the disappointing earnings, which fell five cents a share short of his own projections, contributed to the sell-off by an edgy and currently unforgiving investing public. 
10/wsj_1014:But Smith Barney's Mr. Doyle, who yesterday trimmed his 1990 Anheuser earnings projection to $2.95 a share from $3.10, called the market's reaction "justified." While the third-quarter earnings were a "moderate disappointment," he said, "the real bad news is the intensity of price competition" in the premium-beer sector. 
10/wsj_1014:According to Mr. Steinman, the newsletter publisher, Anheuser's market share is nearly twice that of its nearest competitor, Miller Brewing, which had a 21.2% stake last year.
10/wsj_1015:Tokyo stocks closed easier for the second consecutive day, finishing at the intraday low on index-linked investment trust fund selling toward the end of the afternoon session.
10/wsj_1015:The Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was down 8.65 at 
10/wsj_1015:But losers were spread in a broad range by the end of the session.
10/wsj_1015:A trader at Yamaichi Securities said the market's mood was undercut by the continuing fall of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone shares, which declined to their lowest level since the begining of this year.
10/wsj_1015:Some traders noted individual investors dumped NTT shares amid growing expectation for a division of the company as suggested by a recent government-sponsored panel. 
10/wsj_1015:Dealers said they also took profits to reduce holdings in their own account at the end of the October transaction period. 
10/wsj_1015:Pioneer Electronic and Sony, both of which dominated buying earlier this month, continued to fall Wednesday.
10/wsj_1015:London share prices closed modestly higher largely on technical factors, although the market was underpinned near the end of the session by Wall Street's firmer trend. 
10/wsj_1015:Dealers said the market gained some late steam on a flurry of buying by market-makers looking at blue-chip issues and stocks viewed as oversold during the market's recent downtrend. 
10/wsj_1015:Outside what essentially amounted to a bookkeeping exercise, dealers said London dealings were largely dulled by the absence of active interest beyond the market-makers. 
10/wsj_1015:The late buying was drawn into the London market, dealers added, after Wall Street showed signs of stability following its rocky opening. 
10/wsj_1015:Dealers said the shares were hit by fears of a slowdown in the U.S. economy. 
10/wsj_1015:Equities tumbled at the opening as Tuesday's gyrations on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered most of an 80-point loss, fueled fears of another stock market crash, brokers said. 
10/wsj_1015:Tough talk from trade union officials at the conference of the powerful IG Metall metals worker union in West Berlin raised the specter of nationwide strikes next spring, they said.
10/wsj_1015:They said they expect the bearish mood to persist a while longer, as trading volume is falling toward the end of the year and the market is becoming more volatile. 
10/wsj_1015:Continental gave up some of its recent gains, dropping 8 to 338, as rumors of an impending takeover attempt for the tiremaker faded, brokers said. 
10/wsj_1015:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
10/wsj_1016:French chemicals group, Orkem S.A., said Wednesday it has made a bid for control of Coates Brothers PLC, a British manufacturer of inks and polyester resins. 
10/wsj_1016:State-controlled Orkem already owns 40.6% of Coates.
10/wsj_1016:Orkem declined to give details of its offer, saying only that the bid will be submitted for approval by the board of the British company. 
10/wsj_1017:The Democratic-controlled House, by a margin of 51 votes, failed to override President Bush's veto of legislation renewing federal support of Medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest. 
10/wsj_1017:The 231-191 roll call illustrates the limits of power a resurgent abortion-rights movement still faces.
10/wsj_1017:It continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two-thirds majority required to prevail over Mr. Bush. 
10/wsj_1017:Democrats voted to override by a 3-1 margin, but Republicans were equally firm in support of the president, who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on at least three separate fiscal 1990 spending bills. 
10/wsj_1017:Yesterday's vote dealt with the largest of these bills, an estimated $156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services.
10/wsj_1017:The package is more than $1 billion above the recommendations of Budget Director Richard Darman this week.
10/wsj_1017:But given the political importance of California, the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations.
10/wsj_1017:The $2.85 billion measure comes on top of $1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month, and these totals don't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans. 
10/wsj_1017:In the Senate, Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the House had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months.
10/wsj_1017:The emergency assistance wouldn't be counted against a state's normal allocation of annual highway funds, and the bill circumvents existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll road, such as the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge damaged in last week's earthquake. 
10/wsj_1017:The standoff over abortion is certain to contribute to further delays and, apart from the health and education measure vetoed by Mr. Bush, bills funding the District of Columbia and the entire U.S. foreign-aid budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or family-planning issues. 
10/wsj_1017:At a recent White House meeting, Rep. Silvio Conte (R., Mass.), the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee, argued with his friend Mr. Bush against a veto, and though Mr. Conte and Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois stood with the president yesterday, they are plainly uncomfortable with his position. 
10/wsj_1017:But after years of using the issue for its benefit, the GOP finds its candidates on the defensive.
10/wsj_1017:In an extraordinary mix of cultures and church-state powers, Rep. Robert Dornan (R., Calif.) lectured his fellow Roman Catholics -- including Mr. Florio -- for having the "chutzpah" to disagree with the hierarchy of their church on abortion.
10/wsj_1017:Rep. Les AuCoin was as blunt on behalf of the abortion-rights movement. "This may not make George Bush a one-term president," said the Oregon liberal, addressing the Republican side of the House. "But if you support him over rape victims, this may be your last term." 
10/wsj_1017:The current ceiling on home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased to $124,875, and the bill gives the Department of Housing and Urban Development new authority to facilitate the refinancing of subsidized loans for low-income homeowners. 
10/wsj_1018:The transaction called for Mr. Murdoch's News International PLC, a unit of Australia-based News Corp., to subscribe to a rights issue by Zeta valued at 6.65 billion pesetas ($57 million).
10/wsj_1018:Following its failure last month to win a license for one of Spain's first three private television stations, Zeta is seeking investment opportunities in communications and publishing. 
10/wsj_1018:With annual sales of about 30 billion pesetas, Zeta publishes over a dozen magazines, including the popular Tiempo, Interviu and Panorama, and three regional dailies.
10/wsj_1019:The Big Board this morning plans to begin trading its Exchange Stock Portfolio "basket" product, the first program-trading vehicle carrying the exchange's seal of approval.
10/wsj_1019:ESPs will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in Standard & Poor's index in a single trade of a minimum of $5 million. "Customized" baskets of fewer stocks will also be available. 
10/wsj_1019:The basket products are "an evolutionary step" in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the 1987 market crash, said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest. 
10/wsj_1019:The Big Board argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from more-volatile forms of program trading. 
10/wsj_1019:ESPs are also an attempt by the Big Board to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as London.
10/wsj_1019:Already, many of the Big Board's own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public.
10/wsj_1019:The 400-member Alliance of Floor Brokers said the new product, with the $5 million minimum, will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to "wild spasms of volatility." 
10/wsj_1019:Stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the Big Board's new product confirms the exchange doesn't want to curtail program trading, which last month accounted for a record 13.8% of the exchange's average daily volume. 
10/wsj_1019:"The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here," said James Andrews, head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
10/wsj_1019:And it's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places." 
10/wsj_1020:Comprehensive Care Corp., which has agreed to be acquired by closely held First Hospital Corp., reported a $4.7 million loss for its Aug. 31 first quarter and said it is negotiating an extension of senior bank debt past its Oct. 18 due date. 
10/wsj_1020:In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Comprehensive Care shares plunged $3.625 to close at $4.75 on volume of 1,177,000 shares. 
10/wsj_1020:Revenue in the latest quarter fell 17% to $44 million from $53.2 million, the company said, reflecting poor utilization of the company's facilities and its behavioral medicine contracts. 
10/wsj_1020:Comprehensive Care shareholders have approved acquisition of the developer and operator of Care-Unit chemical dependency and psychiatric programs for about $58 million in cash, notes and stock of First Hospital, Norfolk, Va.
10/wsj_1020:The price was reduced last August from an indicated value of $76 million. 
10/wsj_1020:First Hospital advised Comprehensive Care that an agent for the financial institutions providing financing of its acquisition is scheduled to make a final credit determination tomorrow, and that a favorable determination could result in a reorganization at Comprehensive Care "by the end of October." Failure to win such a determination, however, would lead Comprehensive Care directors to "consider various alternatives," Comprehensive Care said, without elaborating. 
10/wsj_1021:A group including New York investors Douglas A. Kass and Anthony Pedone holds the equivalent of a 12.6% stake in H.H. Robertson Co. 's common shares outstanding, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
10/wsj_1021:Officials of Pittsburgh-based H.H. Robertson, which makes steel roofs, store fronts and building parts, declined comment.
10/wsj_1021:In the SEC filing, the Kass-Pedone group said it intends to acquire additional H.H. Robertson shares "with a view towards a possible change in control of the company." It has not, however, made a formal proposal. 
10/wsj_1021:The group controls 795,900 H.H. Robertson common shares, assuming exercise of an option it acquired from Executive Life Insurance Co. to buy 497,400 shares.
10/wsj_1022:Meanwhile, within the next few weeks, the limited partners in Ivan F. Boesky & Co. L.P. are expected to reach a partial settlement with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. regarding the distribution of the $330 million in partnership assets, said one of the individuals.
10/wsj_1022:Under the terms of the settlement, the limited partners would drop their civil suits against Drexel, now pending in federal court in New York, another individual said. 
10/wsj_1022:Attorneys involved in the talks said that the parties were closer to accord than they were a year ago, when reports of an imminent agreement circulated.
10/wsj_1022:However, less optimistic attorneys warned that because of the tangle of numerous defendants and plaintiffs with overlapping claims, there is always the possibility that the talks will again fall apart. 
10/wsj_1022:A shareholders' accord would provide the first restitution to thousands of individuals and institutions claiming losses as a result of insider trading by Boesky & Co., once the largest arbitrage fund in the U.S.
10/wsj_1022:Charles Davidow, of the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, which represents Mr. Boesky in this matter, said only that "discussions are under way.
10/wsj_1022:Out of this, the government set up a $50 million fund for plaintiffs who can prove their financial losses.
10/wsj_1022:According to William Orbe, an attorney at Grais & Richards, the escrow agents for the fund, as of Sept. 30 the fund amounted to $60.5 million. 
10/wsj_1022:Separately, attorneys for the 42 or so limited partners have had serious discussions that could lead to the distribution of the partnership's assets.
10/wsj_1022:An individual familiar with the negotiations said that whatever investments the limited partners do not recoup from the $330 million in partnership assets, they will receive from the $350 million restitution fund available as a result of Drexel's settlement with the government in December 1988. 
10/wsj_1022:Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $650 million, of which $350 million was set aside for shareholders and other plaintiffs, including the limited partners, who claim they were injured by Drexel. 
10/wsj_1022:U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. ordered the FBI to immediately begin processing Herman Benjamin Ferguson's request for documents stemming from the agency's investigation of him during the 1960s.
10/wsj_1022:Mr. Ferguson, who is 68 years old, fled the U.S. in 1970 after exhausting his appeals of a 1968 conviction on conspiracy to murder.
10/wsj_1022:His attorneys claim he was framed by the FBI and New York police as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s. 
10/wsj_1022:Because the federal Freedom of Information Act wasn't law at that time, the FBI wasn't required to turn over information on its investigations when Mr. Ferguson appealed his conviction in the 1960s.
10/wsj_1022:But in federal court in Manhattan, Judge Patterson said the FBI records could show that Mr. Ferguson's arrest was the result of questionable legal practices. 
10/wsj_1022:The judge said that if the FBI's proposed schedule was followed in releasing the documents, "a delay of over one year will have occurred and plaintiff will have served approximately two-thirds of his 3 1/2-year minimum sentence by the time he receives the files." 
10/wsj_1022:FEDERAL COURTS URGED to cut costs and reduce delays of civil suits. 
10/wsj_1022:The study, conducted by a task force of the Brookings Institution, suggests that Congress should require the courts to develop the plans.
10/wsj_1022:The Washington, D.C., think tank recommends that the courts adopt different "tracks" for different types of civil cases in order to separate the handling of highly complex suits from simpler ones.
10/wsj_1022:The study also said each federal court should set strict time limits for the pretrial exchange of documents and evidence, ranging from as much as 100 days for cases in the fast track to as much as 18 months for complex disputes.
10/wsj_1022:To take advantage of local expertise and custom, the study said, Congress should require each of the 94 federal district courts to adopt its own plan to speed the handling of civil suits and to reduce the high costs in civil cases. 
10/wsj_1022:Although some of the study's recommendations resemble those of similar projects, the makeup of the task force was unusually diverse, adding significance to the effort.
10/wsj_1023:The purchase strengthens San Jose, Calif.-based Businessland's links to the large corporations who are among the biggest buyers of computers.
10/wsj_1023:John Fitzsimmons, chief executive officer of Data Systems, said the company was profitable and expected sales of nearly $100 million this year.
10/wsj_1024:Eastman Kodak Co. of Rochester, N.Y., said its Lehn & Fink Products subsidiary was restructured to form two operating groups, one for household products such as cleaners and disinfectants and the other for do-it-yourself products such as wood finishes and stains. 
10/wsj_1024:The Montvale, N.J., unit said the new operating structure "creates a more focused and responsive organization geared to effectively managing the size and scope of the unit's current business." 
10/wsj_1024:In a related matter, Peter Black, president of consumer brand Minwax, was named group vice president for the household products operating group.
10/wsj_1024:Kenneth M. Evans, president of Thompson & Formby brand, was named group vice president of the do-it-yourself operating group. 
10/wsj_1025:Sotheby's Holdings Inc., the parent of the auction house Sotheby's, said its net loss for the seasonally slow third quarter narrowed from a year earlier on a leap in operating revenue. 
10/wsj_1025:The New York-based company reported a third-quarter net loss of $5.1 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $6.2 million, or 12 cents a share.
10/wsj_1025:The company said 80% of its auction business is usually conducted in the second and fourth quarters, with the current quarter having begun "extremely well." 
10/wsj_1026:Widely expected to open 10 to 15 cents a barrel higher on the strength of statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, the December contract managed to start the session only eight cents higher. 
10/wsj_1026:In the last hour of the trading day, December contract took a tumble to end the session 10 cents lower at $19.62 a barrel.
10/wsj_1026:With no petroleum-related news or changes in the fundamentals to dictate price moves, "technicians are wanting to sell this stuff," said Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp. "And short-term, the technicians may have their way." 
10/wsj_1026:The market quickly discounted the weekly inventory report showing a 6.3 million barrel decrease in U.S. crude oil stocks as the legacy of Hurricane Jerry.
10/wsj_1026:Dismissing the trade group's numbers left traders plenty of time to worry anew about the latest reports on OPEC production.
10/wsj_1026:An AP-Dow Jones survey of integrated oil companies, independent refiners, and oil industry consultants indicates that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production to 22.2 million barrels a day in September.
10/wsj_1026:That level of production isn't of much concern as long as demand continues strong, analysts said.
10/wsj_1026:But the first quarter of the year is generally the weakest and OPEC production doesn't seem to be slackening in anticipation of that.
10/wsj_1026:GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying to profit from technical price trends, as well as continued export strength.
10/wsj_1026:A leveling off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices.
10/wsj_1026:Wheat futures prices fell, however, at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to several million bushels of wheat by commodity speculator Richard Dennis.
10/wsj_1026:Neither Mr. Dennis nor officials of his Chicago trading company, C&D Commodities, could be reached for comment.
10/wsj_1026:As for corn and soybean futures, "a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer-driven buying" supported prices in early trading, said Steven Freed, a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
10/wsj_1026:Soybean futures for November delivery gained 5.25 cents a bushel to close at $5.66 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
10/wsj_1026:December corn futures added 2.25 cents a bushel to close at $2.4225 a bushel on the Board of Trade.
10/wsj_1026:The Soviet Union has purchased roughly eight million tons of grain this month, and is expected to take delivery by year end, analysts said. 
10/wsj_1026:Traders who had sold contracts earlier, in hopes of buying them back at lower prices, yesterday were buying contracts back at higher prices to limit their losses.
10/wsj_1026:This trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists, who see higher prices ahead, and the technicians, who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range, around 71 cents, and selling it when the price climbs more than 74 cents.
10/wsj_1026:He also noted that stocks on Aug. 1, 1990, are currently projected at 3.3 million bales, the smallest end-of-season supply since 1985. 
10/wsj_1026:The market is drifting, at least partly, because of a lack of crop information out of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, the two largest African producers.
10/wsj_1026:Harry Schwartz, a soft commodity specialist for Cargill Investors Services in New York, said the only report Ghana has issued about the arrival of cocoa from the interior was for 7,839 metric tons as of Oct. 12.
10/wsj_1026:A similar situation apparently exists in the Ivory Coast with no figures released yet this year, compared with 55,000 tons as of this time a year ago.
10/wsj_1026:However, the French merchant has about 200,000 tons of old crop Ivory Coast cocoa stored in the Netherlands from an agreement it had negotiated with the Ivory Coast last spring.
10/wsj_1027:Richard D. Sutton, 64 years old, chairman of this bank-holding company, was named acting president and chief executive officer of the company and its First National Bank of Toms River subsidiary.
10/wsj_1027:Mr. Robertson was also removed from the board of First National Bank of New Jersey-Salem County, another unit, and the Toms River bank. 
10/wsj_1028:American Medical International Inc. said it hasn't received any other offers to acquire the owner and operator of hospitals, and took another step toward completion of its $3 billion acquisition by IMA Holdings Corp. 
10/wsj_1028:Under the new offer, IMA will pay $26.50 a share for 63 million shares, or about 86% of the shares outstanding.
10/wsj_1028:Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, AMI common closed at $23.625, up 12.5 cents, on volume of almost 1.8 million. 
10/wsj_1028:Yesterday, American Medical said that the two other parties told the company that they don't have any current intention of making a takeover bid. 
10/wsj_1028:American Medical said its directors have approved what is, in effect, a draft of a solvency opinion on the acquisition, submitted by the Los Angeles-based investment banking and evaluation consulting firm of Houlian Lokey Howard & Zukin Inc.
10/wsj_1028:A final opinion must be approved prior to the acceptance of tendered shares for payment under the offer, which was due to expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT today. 
10/wsj_1028:Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded the ratings of American Medical's senior and subordinated debt issues and those of its international affiliate.
10/wsj_1028:The downgrade anticipates completion of the IMA Holdings acquisition today, Moody's said. 
10/wsj_1028:The ratings concern said the acquisition should result in pretax losses from operations because of increases in interest expense and charges for depreciation and amortization, but that it expects the losses to be reduced through productivity gains and above average growth of the company's hospitals.
10/wsj_1028:Moody's said the ratings anticipate a successful debt-reduction program and modest improvement in discretionary cash flow because of planned asset sales. 
10/wsj_1028:An American Medical spokeswoman said the Moody's downgrading was expected because of the nature of the takeover. 
10/wsj_1029:Bay Financial Corp., Boston, which has been reporting big losses and warning of a possible bankruptcy-law filing, said it was sued by a holder. 
10/wsj_1029:Bay, which has substantial investments in the floundering Massachusetts market, reported a loss of $62 million, or $15.97 a share, for the fiscal year ended June 30.
10/wsj_1030:Keith A. Tucker was named a director of this insurance and financial services concern.
10/wsj_1030:Mr. Tucker, 44 years old, is president of Trivest Securities Corp. and senior vice president of Trivest Inc., closely held investment companies based in Miami.
10/wsj_1030:His selection increases the size of the board to 12 members.
10/wsj_1030:Torchmark also said that Samuel E. Upchurch Jr., 37, vice president and general counsel, was selected to serve the remainder of the term vacated by John S.P. Samford, who resigned as director. 
10/wsj_1031:The giant foods, tobacco and brewing company said it will issue common-share purchase rights to shareholders of record Nov. 8.
10/wsj_1031:Under certain circumstances, the rights would entitle Philip Morris holders to buy shares of either the company or its acquirer for half price. 
10/wsj_1031:The board isn't aware of any attempts to take over Philip Morris, the company said.
10/wsj_1031:As of Sept. 30, Philip Morris had 926 million shares outstanding.
10/wsj_1032:Beghin-Say S.A. said that it plans to sell its remaining paper operations by the end of January as part of a drive to refocus on the food sector and lower its debt. 
10/wsj_1032:The French unit of Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria also disclosed a 40% rise in its consolidated net profit for the first half of 1989, excluding nonrecurring items and after payments to minority interests. 
10/wsj_1032:Beghin-Say said the sale will be done in two parts and will raise a total of 2.025 billion francs ($325 million).
10/wsj_1032:This will include the sale of its interest in the joint venture Beghin Corbehem to Feldemuehle AG.
10/wsj_1032:The other part of the transaction will see Beghin-Say sell its 50% stake in its Kaysersberg paper affiliate to an unspecified unit of the petrochemical group Montedison S.p.
10/wsj_1032:And in a separate transaction, Beghin-Say will sell its remaining 25% interest in A.T.B., a holding company for international trading assets, to an unspecified unit of Ferruzzi for 258 million francs. 
10/wsj_1033:Esselte AB, the Stockholm office supplies company, as expected, proposed to acquire the 22% it doesn't own of its U.S. unit, Esselte Business Systems Inc. 
10/wsj_1033:The price in the proposal is $43.50 for each of the 4.9 million shares the parent doesn't own, or $213.2 million. 
10/wsj_1033:A committee of outside directors for the Garden City, N.Y., unit is evaluating the proposal; the parent asked it to respond by Oct. 31.
10/wsj_1033:The unit, which is the holding company for Esselte's non-Swedish units, accounted for 58% of sales and 71% of operating profit last year. 
10/wsj_1034:House and Senate conferees agreed to continue production of Grumman Corp. 's F-14 and to provide more than $3.8 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative during the current fiscal year. 
10/wsj_1034:Industry officials and congressional aides said that the main points of a compromise defense authorization bill, hammered out during a flurry of private meetings over the past few days, provide a face-saving compromise for both the White House and House Democrats.
10/wsj_1034:President Bush and other supporters of SDI will be able to take credit for blocking House efforts to significantly cut the program to develop a space-based antimissile system, which already has cost some $17 billion.
10/wsj_1034:Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) and other Senate conferees have opposed the House cuts, stalling for almost two months action on a number of big-ticket items in the Pentagon's budget. 
10/wsj_1034:The Senate voted to authorize $4.5 billion for SDI spending in the current fiscal year, but the House, reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program, earmarked only $3.1 billion.
10/wsj_1034:As the head of the House conferees, Rep. Aspin has been under intense pressure from his colleagues to reject Senate provisions that would have abruptly cut further F-14 production. 
10/wsj_1034:But as part of the overall agreement, Grumman and its outspoken supporters on Capitol Hill effectively will be precluded from reopening the emotional issue in the debate over next year's budget. 
10/wsj_1034:Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and most senators contend that the Navy's F-14 is too expensive in an era of shrinking Pentagon budgets.
10/wsj_1034:But the plane boasts a strong core of support in the House, where members are intent on saving Grumman jobs and are worried about potential shortages of carrier-based aircraft by the late 1990s. 
10/wsj_1034:Conferees also agreed to Pentagon requests to earmark a total of nearly $1 billion for work on both mobile MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles, according to congressional aides. 
10/wsj_1034:And lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on a compromise that would give the Air Force nearly all of the $2.4 billion it wants for production of Northrop Corp. 's radar-eluding B-2 bombers, which cost $530 million apiece.
10/wsj_1034:The final B-2 agreement is certain to require detailed testing and verification of the bomber's capabilities, but congressional aides said the accord won't include a House-passed provision that would have withheld production funds until Congress approves a cheaper, scaled-down version of the $70 billion fleet of 132 B-2s envisioned by the Pentagon. 
10/wsj_1035:Revenue totaled $1.01 billion, a 43% increase from $704.4 million, reflecting the company's acquisition of Emery earlier this year. 
10/wsj_1035:Profit also suffered because of "intense" discounting in its long-haul trucking business, the company said. 
10/wsj_1036:A round of futures-related program selling near the close sent the stock market lower in otherwise directionless trading. 
10/wsj_1036:Nervousness that the market hasn't seen the last of its recent volatility kept trading at a moderate pace, as did anticipation of a report on the economy's third-quarter performance. 
10/wsj_1036:The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which plunged more than 80 points in early trading Tuesday and then recovered nearly all of its losses by the close, fell 5.94 to 2653.28 in the latest session. 
10/wsj_1036:The average drifted in a trading range of about 30 points throughout the day.
10/wsj_1036:The lower boundary was established just after the opening in a brief round of selling; the upper boundary was set at midday as scattered bargain-hunting pushed prices higher. 
10/wsj_1036:Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 1.20 to 342.50; the decline was the equivalent of a nine-point setback in the 30-stock average.
10/wsj_1036:The programs occurred against the backdrop of a late pullback in UAL, which had held at slightly lower levels through most of the session amid optimism that another bidder might surface. 
10/wsj_1036:Traders said program activity wasn't in evidence through most of the session, however, and Big Board volume dropped to 155,650,000 shares from about 238 million Tuesday as concerns about the potential for additional sharp swings in the market kept other trading in check. 
10/wsj_1036:"People are sort of nervous to do anything in the market now.
10/wsj_1036:Our phones are quiet around here," said Don R. Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat First Butcher & Singer Inc., Richmond, Va. 
10/wsj_1036:The consensus of economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report calls for a 2.5% annual growth rate for GNP during the quarter. 
10/wsj_1036:American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3/8 to 43 1/2 in Big Board composite trading of 1.5 million shares, Chevron advanced 1 3/4 to 66 5/8 on 2.3 million shares, Woolworth rose 1 to 58 5/8, Coca-Cola Co. gained 5/8 to 72 1/2 and Eastman Kodak added 3/8 to 44 1/2. 
10/wsj_1036:Its third-quarter earnings were lower than analysts had forecast, and the company said it had lowered its projections for earnings growth through the end of 1990 because of planned price cuts. 
10/wsj_1036:Computer Associates International, the most active Big Board issue, was another victim of an earnings-related sell-off.
10/wsj_1036:The stock fell 3/4 to 12 7/8 as 3.6 million shares were traded in the wake of its report that fiscal second-quarter net income fell 66% from a year ago. 
10/wsj_1036:Insurance stocks moved higher in the wake of a strong third-quarter earnings report from Chubb, coming on the heels of speculation that last week's devastating earthquake in the San Francisco area would lead to higher premium rates. 
10/wsj_1036:TW Services dropped 1 1/4 to 31 1/4 following the postponement of a $1.4 billion junk-bond offering that would have permitted Coniston Partners to complete its takeover of the company.
10/wsj_1036:UAL stock declined by 9 to 161 after nobody surfaced to claim credit for aggressive buying Tuesday by Bear Stearns that sent UAL stock up 35 points in a matter of hours.
10/wsj_1036:Stocks that reportedly benefited Tuesday from a Japanese buy program handled by PaineWebber gave back some of their gains.
10/wsj_1036:Goldman Sachs placed the stock back on its list of recommended issues, raised its 1990 earnings estimate and recommended that its clients shift funds from Kellogg to General Mills.
10/wsj_1036:The company offered to purchase $500 million of convertible preferred stock from the trust that handles its payments to asbestos victims. 
10/wsj_1036:Esselte AB of Sweden offered $43.50 a share for the 22% of the company it doesn't already own. 
10/wsj_1036:Public Service of New Hampshire went up 3/8 to 4.
10/wsj_1036:The partnership, which had solicited takeover offers, said it failed to receive any adequate bids for all of its operations but is reviewing offers for individual properties. 
10/wsj_1037:Its capital spending is growing at double-digit rates for the second year in a row, and its superefficient producers of everything from cars to computer chips are rushing to expand capacity, modernize factories and develop new products. 
10/wsj_1037:"The boom's so huge," says Mitsuru Saito, an economist at Sanwa Research Institute, "it makes you think of the Golden '60s," when Japan developed rapidly. 
10/wsj_1037:At Canon Inc., for example, sales are up nearly 20% this year; so, the maker of cameras and computer printers is doing what any Japanese company would do under the circumstances: It is increasing capital spending -- by 60%.
10/wsj_1037:Some 70% of them are to be exported to the U.S. 
10/wsj_1037:So big is the capital-spending boom that Japanese companies' outlays in Japan topped American companies' domestic outlays by $521.4 billion to $494.8 billion in the 12 months ended March 31 even though Japan's total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds America's. 
10/wsj_1037:They fear that the boom may be too big for Japan's or anyone else's good. "It's an explosive cocktail" thrown at the world, says Kenneth Courtis, senior economist at the Tokyo unit of Deutsche Bank Group.
10/wsj_1037:The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging Japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending.
10/wsj_1037:MITI officials hope to avoid yet-another source of trade friction with the U.S. even though export restraints currently limit Japanese car exports to the U.S. 
10/wsj_1037:According to a survey of some 2,400 large companies by the Japan Development Bank, expanded capacity is the goal of just 51.8% of the outlays; for manufacturers alone, the figure is 32%.
10/wsj_1037:The manufacturers said 14.2% of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones, 17.5% is to cut costs, 12.5% is for research and development, and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes. 
10/wsj_1037:With Japan running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world, they think that Japan should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more.
10/wsj_1037:Japan's marathon economy, growing at 4.3% this year, is now in its 35th month of expansion, and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record 57-month expansion in the late 1960s. 
10/wsj_1037:Similarly, Honda Motor Co. 's sales are so brisk that workers grumble they haven't had a Saturday off in years, despite the government's encouragement of more leisure activity. 
10/wsj_1037:Among them are the shipbuilders, which had halved their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are capturing an increased share of the strengthening global market.
10/wsj_1037:Sasebo Heavy Industries Co., a medium-sized shipbuilder, expects its sales to increase 30% this year, largely because of rising demand for oil tankers. 
10/wsj_1037:The emphasis on market share is evident at Daikin Industries Ltd., Japan's biggest maker of industrial air conditioners.
10/wsj_1037:Nissan aims to expand its 25% share of the market to 30% by spending $141 million on a plant in southern Japan that could make as many as 240,000 cars a year.
10/wsj_1037:Although imports account for less than 1% of beer sales in Japan, Asahi Breweries Ltd., which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer, plans to fend off Japanese competitors by pouring $1.06 billion into facilities to brew 50% more beer.
10/wsj_1037:Moreover, much of the investment boom is in high-tech fields in which Japanese companies have only limited foreign competition; so, more investment practically assures more exports.
10/wsj_1037:Toshiba Corp., for example, is spending $986 million on two new plants to build four-megabit dynamic random access memories, the next generation of computer chips.
10/wsj_1037:The product isn't widely used yet, but Toshiba, which has already beaten everyone else in producing the current-generation one-megabit DRAMs, believes that its early investment will heighten its chances of beating its competitors again. "It's important to gain leadership," a Toshiba spokesman says. 
10/wsj_1037:Some of Japan's goods being produced as a result of the investment boom are already successful overseas.
10/wsj_1037:The losers will be those with the least attractive products, and many of them, analysts think, will be foreign companies. 
10/wsj_1038:Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings & Loan Association said it plans to restructure in the wake of a third-quarter loss of $7.7 million, or $1.01 a share, reflecting an $11 million addition to loan-loss reserves. 
10/wsj_1038:A year ago, Benjamin Franklin had profit of $1.8 million, or 23 cents a share. 
10/wsj_1038:The plan may include selling branches, consolidating or eliminating departments, and winding down or disposing of unprofitable units within 18 months. 
10/wsj_1038:Details of the restructuring won't be made final until regulators approve the regulations mandated by the new federal act, the company said. 
10/wsj_1039:Amdahl Corp., a maker of mainframe computers, reported a sharp decline in net income for its third quarter, citing pricecutting by competitors and adverse effects from a strong U.S. dollar. 
10/wsj_1039:Jay Stevens, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said he expected the Sunnyvale, Calif., company to earn 35 cents a share for the quarter and said the firm's weaker profit was partly the result of increased competition from International Business Machines Corp., Amdahl's principal competitor for mainframe sales. 
10/wsj_1040:ONEIDA Ltd. declared a 10% stock dividend, payable Dec. 15 to stock of record Nov. 17.
10/wsj_1040:The Oneida, N.Y., maker of consumer, food-service and industrial products also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 12 cents a share, with the same payable and record dates.
10/wsj_1041:Announcement of the approval is expected to be made by Louis Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services.
10/wsj_1041:The clearance by the Food and Drug Administration comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of AIDS to the only antiviral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease. 
10/wsj_1041:The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection. 
10/wsj_1041:But despite more than two years of research showing AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children, the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients.
10/wsj_1041:As a result, many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and, for the few exceptions, insurance carriers won't cover its cost of $6,400 a year. 
10/wsj_1041:To date, 1,013 of those children have died, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. 
10/wsj_1041:Mothers of young AIDS patients expressed somber satisfaction. 
10/wsj_1041:It should have happened sooner," said Elizabeth Glaser, a Los Angeles mother and activist who contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion, and transmitted it to two of her children.
10/wsj_1041:One of them, a daughter Ariel, died a year ago at age seven after her parents unsuccessfully pleaded for the drug. 
10/wsj_1041:The delay in getting AZT to children has been blamed on a combination of factors.
10/wsj_1041:Traditionally, the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses, because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape.
10/wsj_1041:Secondly, critics have charged AZT's maker Burroughs Wellcome Co. with corporate inertia because children account for just 1% of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market. 
10/wsj_1041:Still, all this comes nearly a year and a half after Philip Pizzo of the National Cancer Institute offered evidence that AZT could reverse the ravages of AIDS dementia, sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of IQ levels and reappearance of lost motor skills.
10/wsj_1041:To some mothers, the expected FDA action is a poignant reminder of what might have been. 
10/wsj_1041:Why has it taken people so long for people to understand pediatric AIDS is a major problem?" asked Helen Kushnick, whose son Samuel died six years ago at age three, victim of a tainted transfusion. 
10/wsj_1041:Mrs. Glaser, who is a co-founder of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, based in Santa Monica, Calif., condemned neither bureaucratic nor corporate foot-dragging. 
10/wsj_1041:AIDS dementia -- which gradually steals children's ability to speak, walk and think -- is often the most striking aspect of the pediatric syndrome.
10/wsj_1041:For some patients, AZT has restored the ability to ride a bicycle or solve puzzles, giving back a piece of their childhood if only temporarily. 
10/wsj_1041:"It's impossible to overstate how much this means to the families of these patients," said Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute and a main developer of AZT. 
10/wsj_1042:AVON RENT-A-CAR & TRUCK Corp. said it declared a dividend of one warrant for each three shares of common stock.
10/wsj_1042:Each of the Class C warrants will enable the holders to purchase one share of common stock at $5.50.
10/wsj_1042:Avon also said it will issue an additional 243,677 of the Class C warrants to holders of its Class A, Class B and unclassified warrants.
10/wsj_1042:Issuance of those warrants will be at the rate of one-third warrant for each warrant exercised. 
10/wsj_1043:The new "baskets" of stocks will allow big investors to buy or sell all 500 S&P index stocks in a single trade.
10/wsj_1043:Kemper Financial Services has stopped executing its stock trades through four big securities firms because of their involvement in program trading, which Kemper and others say is ruining the market. 
10/wsj_1043:Also, Armco and National Intergroup had lower operating profit in steel, marking what may be the end of a two-year industry boom.

10/wsj_1045:Adolph Coors Co. said William K. Coors, chairman, assumed the additional responsibilities of president, succeeding Jeffrey H. Coors. 
10/wsj_1045:But the brewer said Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co., a small unit of Coors he has run for several years. 
10/wsj_1045:A Coors spokesman said the company doesn't believe the move will further increase William Coors's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors, Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr., who run the company's three operating units. 
10/wsj_1045:"It certainly wasn't intended to be a demotion," the spokesman said. "Pete and Jeff and Joe Jr. have taken over the reins and are doing most of the work.
10/wsj_1045:Peter Coors runs the Coors Brewing Co. unit, the nation's fourth-largest brewery that accounted for $1.24 billion of Adolph Coors's $1.52 billion in 1988 sales.

10/wsj_1046:Failures in seven of nine regional areas fell more than 10% in the nine months.
10/wsj_1046:This occurred partly because of more competition as the number of new businesses surged. 
10/wsj_1047:A spokeswoman said Toronto-based Campeau has received "expressions of interest" in Bloomingdale's, but she declined to comment on whether any actual bids had been made.
10/wsj_1047:"This is the first of many rumors we expect to hear during the sale's process," said a Bloomingdale's spokesman. "We won't comment on them." 
10/wsj_1047:Investment bankers in Tokyo confirmed that Tokyu Department Store is one of several Japanese companies that has been approached by representatives of a management committee headed by Bloomingdale's Mr. Traub.
10/wsj_1047:"Nobody is going to make a real bid before the middle of November," said one investment banker familiar with the discussions in Japan. "Tokyu is one of the potential buyers who might raise its hand.
10/wsj_1047:Bloomingdale's is a 17-store chain acquired last year by Campeau in its $6.6 billion acquisition of Federated.
10/wsj_1047:The sale of Bloomingdale's is a condition of efforts by Toronto-based Olympia & York Developments Ltd. to arrange $800 million in bridge financing for Campeau, which disclosed last month that its retailing units, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., were strapped for cash.
10/wsj_1047:O&Y, owned by Toronto's Reichmann family, is also supervising major restructuring and refinancing of Campeau, a Toronto-based real estate and retailing company.

10/wsj_1048:McCaw wants to buy 22 million shares of LIN for $125 each, or $2.75 billion, which would result in McCaw's owning 50.3% of LIN.
10/wsj_1049:NICHOLS INSTITUTE declared a 2-for-1 split of its common stock, payable Nov. 27 to stock of record Nov. 10.
10/wsj_1050:Farmington, N.M.-based Mesa has consistently rejected StatesWest's offers, and early this week said its board wouldn't give the proposal further consideration, calling it "vague and ill-defined" because it didn't describe the source of funds or the specific terms of StatesWest securities which were part of the offer. 
10/wsj_1050:The new letter purports to do this, saying that in addition to $7 a share in cash, StatesWest would offer one share of new 6% convertible preferred stock of StatesWest it values at $3 a share.
10/wsj_1050:It also said the cash portion of the transaction would be financed with StatesWest's own cash and short-term investments, plus debt and other financing arranged through Hibbard Brown & Co., the company's investment banker. 
10/wsj_1051:The catalog retailer reported net income of $10.8 million, or 21 cents a share, up sharply from $6.6 million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier.

10/wsj_1051:The year-ago quarter's results were crimped by expenses associated with Spiegel's $260 million acquisition of catalog-clothing-merchandiser Eddie Bauer, Spiegel noted.
10/wsj_1051:Spiegel is 84%-controlled by the Otto family of West Germany.
10/wsj_1052:The bad news in the junk bond market yesterday was that TW Services, a group of restaurant chains, became the latest prospective issuer to get a cold shoulder from bond buyers. 
10/wsj_1052:The good news -- to fans of stable credit, at least -- is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk buyers.
10/wsj_1052:Coniston Partners, which with related entities controls 80% of TW, had been planning to sell $1.15 billion of junk bonds, among other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares. 
10/wsj_1052:But Coniston, a New York partnership managed by the firm of Gollust, Tierney & Oliver, yesterday announced that "in view of unsettled conditions in securities markets" the offering would be postponed and restructured.
10/wsj_1052:What wasn't mentioned is that Coniston and its investment banker, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, just completed a two-week "road show" for the purpose of marketing the bonds.
10/wsj_1052:Until recently, such buy-now, pray-for-growth-later deals were routine. "But people don't buy anything on expectation anymore," says Jack Utter, who manages the high-yield fund of IDS Financial Services. "Investors," he adds, "are getting religion." The TW buy-out may yet be financed. "There is nothing wrong with the company," says Coniston principal Paul Tierney.
10/wsj_1052:And the total amount of junk financing will be reduced. 
10/wsj_1052:Indeed, the DLJ banker says, in the reborn capital structure cash coverage of interest "will meaningfully improve." As he sums it up: "We are listening to the market." 
10/wsj_1052:Some of the same risks that were cited -- and seemingly ignored -- in dozens of previous junk offerings. 
10/wsj_1052:The TW prospectus says that if the acquisition had been completed earlier, pretax earnings "would have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges, including interest on debt securities," by approximately $62.7 million in the first six months of 1989.
10/wsj_1052:TW notes, as many junk issuers do, that "adjusted to eliminate non-cash charges" TW would have run a cash surplus -- in this case, of $56 million over six months. 
10/wsj_1052:But such calculations ignore the noncash charge of depreciation, taken to allow for the gradual wearing out of french friers, deterioration of stores and the like.
10/wsj_1052:In fact, DLJ says, the company envisions capital expenses of about $180 million a year. 
10/wsj_1052:DLJ argues that TW could, if necessary, cut capital spending, since half of what it plans to spend is for "growth," rather than maintenance.

10/wsj_1053:Mrs. Thatcher, who was practicing the read-my-lips school of politics years before Mr. Bush encountered it, has made clear her opposition to refashioning Britain's free-market policies to suit the bureaucrats in Brussels.
10/wsj_1053:Well, it now turns out that Mrs. Thatcher had to travel across the globe to the 49-member Commonwealth summit in Kuala Lumpur to discomfit the Holy Order of Consensus Builders. 
10/wsj_1053:She issued a separate statement, separating herself from a Commonwealth document reasserting the political value of imposing sanctions against South Africa.
10/wsj_1053:Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sniffed, "If everybody else puts out their left foot and you put out your right foot, you are out of step." Mrs. Thatcher: "If it's one against 48, I'm very sorry for the 48." 
10/wsj_1054:Or a state of total exhaustion. 
10/wsj_1055:Of the 4,348 issues that changed hands, 1,074 advanced and 866 declined. 
10/wsj_1055:Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 Index of the big non-financial stocks basically stood still, easing 0.12, to 452.23. 
10/wsj_1055:Lance Zipper, head of over-the-counter trading at Kidder Peabody, said it is difficult to make predictions based on yesterday's trading volume.
10/wsj_1055:The president of Herzog, Heine, Mr. Geduld expects the market to be "very choppy" for a while. "There's a lot of uncertainty out there, and it will cause a lot of swings," he said. 
10/wsj_1055:Among active stocks, MCI Communications rose 7/8 to 43 on 2.2 million shares, Mentor Graphics added 1/8 to 16 3/8 on turnover of 1.5 million shares.

10/wsj_1055:Cimflex Teknowledge rose 13/16, or 39%, to 2 7/8 on volume of 494,100 shares.
10/wsj_1055:The maker of software products and services, which had a net loss in the 1988 third quarter, earned 200,000, or a penny a share, in this year's quarter.
10/wsj_1055:The company suffered a $9 million loss in the third quarter, compared with net of $2.5 million a year earlier. 
10/wsj_1056:Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
10/wsj_1057:But Mr. Pilson has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights, a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid. 
10/wsj_1057:"The price of poker has gone up," crows Charles M. Neinas, the College Football Association's executive director. 
10/wsj_1057:With CBS Inc. on a spending spree that may top $2.5 billion for four years of major sports events, the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business.
10/wsj_1057:CBS itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong.
10/wsj_1057:ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. also risk losses if they outbid CBS for other contracts. 
10/wsj_1057:Advertisers already are balking at higher prices. "The networks are paying too much for rights," warns adman Paul Isacsson of Young & Rubicam. "If they ask advertisers to absorb the costs, they're likely to lose all but a few who need sports, above all." 
10/wsj_1057:Soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials.
10/wsj_1057:Mr. Pilson emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press, contented affiliate stations, enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other CBS programs when the game is over.
10/wsj_1057:Some TV people doubt they will materialize and argue that even if they do, they won't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that CBS could run up. "As we've seen in the '80s," says Roger Werner, the president of the ESPN sports channel, "those deals can turn sour if the numbers don't work.
10/wsj_1057:And three years later, in a sea of red ink, the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining to do." 
10/wsj_1057:CBS pursues top sports "to belie the fact that they aren't supporting affiliates, viewers and advertisers," charges Thomas H. Wyman, who was ousted as chairman of CBS Inc. after Laurence A. Tisch bought a 24.9% stake in the company and took over three years ago. "They lost the entertainment crown, and they needed one.
10/wsj_1057:On just three big deals -- for four years of baseball and for the Olympic Winter Games in both 1992 and 1994 -- Pilson bid a total of $1.64 billion.
10/wsj_1057:Now, Mr. Pilson -- a former college basketball player who says a good negotiator needs "a level offocus and intellectual attention" similar to a good athlete-s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness.
10/wsj_1057:"What happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports," says Peter Lund, a former CBS Sports president now at Multimedia Inc. J. William Grimes, former president of ESPN, says NBC may "come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from CBS and say, 'We can overbid, too. ' And the winners will be the colleges, not either network.
10/wsj_1057:In the mid-1980s, after ABC had just bid a record $309 million for the 1988 Winter Games, he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices. "I love Pilson, but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly," says Robert Wussler, a former CBS Sports president. "And yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today." Rivals carp at "the principle of Pilson," as NBC's Arthur Watson once put it -- "he's always expounding that rights are too high, then he's going crazy." 
10/wsj_1057:And he isn't the only big spender: NBC will pay a record $401 million for the 1992 Summer Games, and ESPN, 80%-owned by Capital Cities/ABC, will shell out $400 million for four years of baseball, airing 175 regular-season games a year. 
10/wsj_1057:Five months later, Mr. Tisch took over as CBS's chief executive, and soon he was wielding sole approval each time Mr. Pilson scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper, sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators. 
10/wsj_1057:The "Major Events" strategy, Mr. Pilson says, is designed to notch a place for CBS on the crowded TV dial of the 1990s.
10/wsj_1057:He sees flashy sports as the only way the last-place network can cut through the clutter of cable and VCRs, grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering a few weeks later.
10/wsj_1057:That will please once-grumpy affiliates -- another aim of the Pilson plan.
10/wsj_1057:CBS will air the Super Bowl, baseball playoffs, college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events. "It's made me more committed to CBS," says Philip A. Jones, the president of Meredith Corp. 's broadcast group, which has two CBS affiliates. 
10/wsj_1057:The CBS plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success, however.
10/wsj_1057:No amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak. "In this market of 40 channels, sophisticated viewers and the remote control, trial isn't a guarantee of anything," ESPN's Mr. Werner says. "If the show ain't a killer, they're gone." 
10/wsj_1057:It alone isn't likely to stop a station from dumping CBS shows. "The World Series, seven nights, wasn't enough of an incentive," says Arnold Klinsky of WHEC-TV in Rochester, which dropped CBS for NBC six weeks ago. "You've got to judge where the network will be in three years." 
10/wsj_1057:But Mr. Tisch expects losses in all four years of the contract, he told U.S. senators last June. 
10/wsj_1057:CBS will pay an average of $82 million more each year than ABC and NBC had paid together -- and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season.
10/wsj_1057:Moreover, "there's no question ad rates will come down considerably" from the GM-Toyota price, says Arnold Chase of Bozell Inc. Other admen, however, say rates could rise later if ad spending surges. 
10/wsj_1057:ABC lost $75 million on the 1988 Winter Games, partly because of its $309 million rights fee.
10/wsj_1057:It aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in Calgary -- helping raise ratings slightly from 1984 -- but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers. 
10/wsj_1057:CBS will add 25 1/2 hours to that load in 1992, and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events.
10/wsj_1057:All prime-time fare will be on tape-delay because of time differences with Norway, so the results can be announced on the 6 o'clock news. (Turner Broadcasting will pay CBS $25 million to air 50 hours of CBS coverage plus 50 hours of additional events.) 
10/wsj_1057:Moreover, sports has "claimed its place" as a guaranteed ratings-getter, says David J. Stern, the commissioner of the National Basketball Association. "This isn't outlandish bidding; this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it. . . . I would tend to trust their judgment." 
10/wsj_1057:Although sports officials predict jumps of 50% to 100% in the major contracts coming up for renewal, ad rates may rise only 20%.
10/wsj_1057:CBS hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time.
10/wsj_1057:Each hour of Olympics and baseball in prime time will cost CBS $2.6 million to $2.8 million; an hour-long drama costs only $900,000, and it is aired twice. 
10/wsj_1057:But media-stock analyst Richard J. MacDonald of MacDonald Grippo Riely says Wall Street won't take kindly to that. "On a stand-alone basis, the network ought to make money," he says. 
10/wsj_1058:Eavesdropping -- both corporate and private -- is on the rise, thanks to the proliferation of surveillance technologies.
10/wsj_1058:And while sellers of the equipment and companies "monitoring" employees have few qualms, right-to-privacy advocates and some lawmakers are alarmed. 
10/wsj_1058:"New technologies are changing the way we deal with each other and the way we work," says Janlori Goldman, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. "Our expectation of confidentiality is being eroded." 
10/wsj_1058:The Communications Workers of America, which opposes such monitoring, says supervisors listen in on an estimated 400 million calls each year.
10/wsj_1058:Among companies saying they monitor employees are United Airlines, American Airlines, United Parcel Service, Nynex Corp., Spiegel Inc., and the circulation department of this newspaper.
10/wsj_1058:Businesses "want to verify information and ensure accuracy," says John Hiltunen, Dictaphone's manager of media relations.
10/wsj_1058:The state of Alaska recently bought the Veritrac system, he says, "to monitor the Exxon cleanup effort." 
10/wsj_1058:Shearson says it has taped some of its institutional trading desks, such as commodities and futures, for about four years.
10/wsj_1058:The most common use of spying devices is in divorce cases, say private investigators.
10/wsj_1058:Concerned with the increased availability of surveillance technology and heavier use of it, lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue.
10/wsj_1058:Nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring.
10/wsj_1058:"I'm sympathetic with workers who feel under the gun," says Richard Barton of the Direct Marketing Association of America, which is lobbying strenuously against the Edwards beeper bill. "But the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening." The powerful group, which represents many of the nation's telemarketers, was instrumental in derailing the 1987 bill. 
10/wsj_1058:Laura Dale, center manager at the catalog company's customer order center in Reno, Nev., defends monitoring. "We like to follow up and make sure operators are achieving our standards of company service," says Ms. Dale, who supervises 350 operators. 
10/wsj_1058:Federal wiretap statutes recognize the right of employers to monitor employees' for evaluation purposes.
10/wsj_1058:But opponents, led by the CWA, say new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and 81% of monitored workers aren't represented by unions.
10/wsj_1058:"Nine to Five," a Cleveland-based office workers organization that supports the beeper bill, six months ago started a privacy hot line to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses. 
10/wsj_1058:Meanwhile, supporters of the Dellums two-party consent bill say it is needed because of a giant loophole in the one-party consent law.
10/wsj_1058:Currently, if the person taping is a party to the conversation, it's all right to record without the knowledge of the other person on the line. (Intercepting other people's private conversations is illegal and punishable by five years in prison and fines of $10,000.) 
10/wsj_1058:Some marketers of surveillance gear -- including Communication Control System Ltd., which owns the Counter Spy Shop and others like it -- already put warning labels in their catalogs informing customers of the one-party law.
10/wsj_1058:Radio Shack says it has a policy against selling products if a salesperson suspects they will be used illegally. "Everything sold at Radio Shack has a legal purpose," says Bernard Appel, president of the Tandy Corp. subsidiary.
10/wsj_1058:Still, Radio Shack is aware that some of its products are controversial.
10/wsj_1059:The hottest rivalry in the computer industry intensified sharply yesterday as Digital Equipment Corp. announced its first line of mainframe computers, targeting International Business Machines Corp. 's largest market. 
10/wsj_1059:IBM fired back with new mainframes of its own, extending the long-dominant 3090 line with a 7% to 14% power boost. 
10/wsj_1059:Up to now, the intense competition between IBM and Digital has been confined largely to the broad midrange of the computer market, where Digital sought to exploit IBM's weaknesses in networking.
10/wsj_1059:But Digital's move into mainframes will target IBM's home turf, where it has a commanding 70% share of the market. 
10/wsj_1059:IBM said the 16 new J and JH models will generally be available immediately, though three won't ship until the third quarter of next year.
10/wsj_1059:Digital's VAX 9000 mainframes, which it claimed were among the fastest available, were priced from $1.2 million to $3.9 million, sharply lower than IBM models of comparable power.
10/wsj_1059:Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said he may cut his earnings estimate for the current fiscal year because he had expected at least some mainframe profit this year.
10/wsj_1059:Large Digital buyers say the new VAX will let them stay with Digital when they need the power of a mainframe, instead of turning to IBM. "I'm convinced there's a huge market for this machine," said Stephen Smith of PaineWebber Inc. 
10/wsj_1059:Digital also plans to compete fiercely with IBM when the giant's customers are computerizing new aspects of their businesses.
10/wsj_1059:In addition to commercial markets, Digital's new line targets the low end of the engineering and scientific supercomputer market, when it's packaged with an optional supercharger, known as a vector processor. 
10/wsj_1059:The slow-growing mainframe market also has shown new signs of life lately.
10/wsj_1059:IBM, Armonk, N.Y., said it wanted to bring out the mainframes as soon as it could to spark as many sales as possible by the end of the year.
10/wsj_1059:IBM has already indicated it will have problems in the quarter, partly because of a delay in shipping a high-end disk drive and partly because the strong dollar will cut significantly the value of IBM's overseas earnings when translated into dollars.
10/wsj_1060:Concord Camera Corp. completed the acquisition of Peter Bauser G.m.b.
10/wsj_1062:But now that Congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the Gramm-Rudman targets, the White House said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill, on which Congress continues to work. "If that doesn't happen, then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote," said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. 
10/wsj_1062:The White House said he plans to hold a series of private White House meetings, mostly with Senate Democrats, to try to persuade lawmakers to fall in line behind the tax cut. 
10/wsj_1062:According to some who attended, the senators argued that the president should give the Democratic leaders in Congress a victory of their own to compensate them for allowing the president to win on the controversial capital-gains issue.
10/wsj_1063:Toshiba Corp. said its new French marketing concern has started operating under the aegis of the company's West German subsidiary, which formerly handled all sales of Toshiba electronic products in France. 
10/wsj_1063:A recent change in French law, according to Toshiba, permitted formation of the semiconductor marketing arm in Paris. 
10/wsj_1064:Two products in what the telecommunications giant called a new generation of such equipment are available now, AT&T said, and three others will be introduced in 1990 and 1991.
10/wsj_1064:The products are aimed at a market expected to total more than $1 billion a year in sales by 1995, said Morgan Buchner Jr., vice president of transmission systems for AT&T. 
10/wsj_1064:The products already available are cross-connect systems, used instead of mazes of wiring to interconnect other telecommunications equipment.
10/wsj_1064:"These products are the heart of our transmission-product line," Mr. Buchner said.
10/wsj_1064:He declined to disclose specific prices, but said each product costs in the tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of dollars. 
10/wsj_1064:AT&T said it expects to beat to the marketplace two rivals, Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada and France's Alcatel N.V., which also have announced Sonet-based products. 
10/wsj_1064:It noted that last July, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. of Japan selected AT&T to supply $154 million of such equipment over a four-year period starting next year. 
10/wsj_1065:The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has reverberated through some of the nation's largest law firms. 
10/wsj_1065:While it is still too early to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary, many lawyers say their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work, which has been so lucrative in the past.
10/wsj_1065:Much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour.
10/wsj_1065:If deals take longer to complete and there are fewer of them to do, "you can't bill the same kind of premium as when deals took a few weeks from start to finish," says one lawyer at a large New York firm. 
10/wsj_1065:Lawyers at such firms as Sullivan & Cromwell; Willkie Farr & Gallagher; Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson all say they, too, have experienced a significant slowdown, particularly during the past few weeks. "Everyone is waiting to see if deals can be done at sensible prices and if money is available," said Jack Nusbaum, co-chairman of Willkie Farr. "It's hard to know right now if the change is fundamental or cyclical." 
10/wsj_1065:Dennis Block, a partner at the New York firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said that in the first eight months of this year, 89 hostile offers were launched, compared with 157 for the first eight months of 
10/wsj_1065:What's more, he said, "transactions are taking a much longer time to conclude and many fall apart for lack of financing" and more stringent scrutiny by state courts.
10/wsj_1065:Lawyers also say an erratic stock market and uncertain financing conditions have sharply reduced the number of lucrative big deals likely to be proposed. 
10/wsj_1065:Still, some lawyers say the mergers slowdown hasn't affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones. "We just took another floor for our London offices," said Joseph Flom of the New York firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. 
10/wsj_1065:Davis Polk & Wardwell also said its international clients are keeping mergers and acquisitions partners busy. "European companies are looking to buy American ones," said Henry King, the managing partner at that firm. "But the question is whether things people are looking at will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market conditions." 
10/wsj_1065:In the trial of former Haas Securities Chairman Eugene Laff, the defense accused one of the government's chief witnesses of threatening to kill Mr. Laff. 
10/wsj_1065:In March, Mr. Laff was indicted on 15 counts of conspiracy, mail and securities fraud, and obstructing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
10/wsj_1065:The government has charged that Mr. Lorin and Mr. Laff were part of a conspiracy to maintain the prices of certain stocks at artificially high prices.
10/wsj_1065:Mr. Lorin, a stock promoter, pleaded guilty to the stock-manipulation charges in April and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation of Mr. Laff. 
10/wsj_1065:During his cross examination of Mr. Lorin, Mr. Lang read from the transcripts of a conversation that was taped Oct. 20, 1988.
10/wsj_1065:From the parts of the transcript read by Mr. Lang, it was unclear what exactly Mr. Lorin feared might happen.
10/wsj_1065:When asked for a copy of the transcript, Mr. Lang said Judge Thomas P. Griesa had instructed him not to release it or the memorandum. 
10/wsj_1065:Stephen A. Saltzburg, one of five trustees appointed to monitor payments to women injured by the Dalkon Shield intrauterine contraceptive, resigned, citing personal reasons. 
10/wsj_1065:Mr. Saltzburg, who teaches evidence at the University of Virginia School of Law and was a deputy assistant attorney general in the U.S. Justice Department until August, submitted his resignation earlier this month to federal Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr., in Richmond, Va.
10/wsj_1065:Judge Merhige is overseeing the bankruptcy-law reorganization of A.H. Robins Co., the company that manufactured the shield.
10/wsj_1065:The $2.38 billion Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust was established as part of A.H. Robins' bankruptcy-reorganization plan to resolve injury claims arising from use of the shield.
10/wsj_1065:THE PHILADELPHIA law firm of Ballard, Spahr, Andrews & Ingersoll said three partners have joined its business and finance department.
10/wsj_1065:John Ake, 48, a former vice-president in charge of legal compliance at American Capital Management & Research Inc., in Houston, will join Ballard Spahr's corporate-securities practice.
10/wsj_1065:Kent Walker, 45, a former partner at the Philadelphia law firm of Mesirov, Gelman, Jaffe, Cramer & Jamieson, will specialize in antitrust, real estate and mergers and acquisitions.
10/wsj_1066:Delmed Inc. 's top two officers resigned and were succeeded by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent, Fresenius AG, a major Delmed holder that has been negotiating to acquire a controlling stake. 
10/wsj_1066:Mr. Ehrlich was succeeded as chairman by Gerd Krick, a director of Fresenius, a West German pharmaceutical concern.
10/wsj_1066:Ben Lipps, president of Fresenius USA, was named president, chief executive and chief operating officer. 
10/wsj_1066:None of the officials was available for comment. 
10/wsj_1066:Fresenius owns about 42% of Delmed's fully diluted common stock.
10/wsj_1066:The two companies have been discussing a transaction under which Fresenius would buy Delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70% and 80% of Delmed's fully diluted common stock.
10/wsj_1066:Under the proposal, Delmed would issue about 123.5 million additional Delmed common shares to Fresenius at an average price of about 65 cents a share, though under no circumstances more than 75 cents a share. 
10/wsj_1066:Yesterday, Delmed said it "continues to explore the possibility of a combination with Fresenius USA." It added that it is apparent that any terms of a combination "would be substantially less favorable than those previously announced." 
10/wsj_1067:Philip L. Hall, president of J. Lawrence Hall Co., Nashua, was named a director of this thrift holding company, filling a vacancy. 
10/wsj_1068:Kennametal Inc. said it intends to acquire J&L America Inc. for $44 million plus a consideration of as much as an additional $12 million, payable over five years. 
10/wsj_1068:J&L, whose principal offices are in Detroit, is a mail-order distributer of industrial tools and supplies. 
10/wsj_1069:Genentech Inc. said third-quarter profit more than doubled to $11.4 million, or 13 cents a share, from a depressed 1988 third-quarter performance of $5.3 million, or six cents a share. 
10/wsj_1069:Sales of the heart drug TPA were $43.6 million, better than last year's depressed third period when the company sold just $29.1 million of the drug.
10/wsj_1069:But TPA sales fell below levels for this year's first and second quarter sales of $48 million, cooling investors.
10/wsj_1070:THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY'S 1988 costs of fund raising and administration were $72.4 million, or 23.2% of its revenue.
10/wsj_1071:Ryder System Inc. posted a third-quarter net loss of $27.6 million, because of an expected $57 million after-tax charge and continued weakness in the company's truck-rental business. 
10/wsj_1071:The loss, which is 38 cents a share, is the transportation services concern's first quarterly setback in more than a decade and compares with net income of $55.3 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
10/wsj_1071:The previous year's third quarter included gains on the sale of aircraft by the company's Aviation Leasing & Services Division.
10/wsj_1071:The latest quarter's after-tax charge -- which is 75 cents a share -- was related to adjustments to reserves for workers' compensation claims; reductions in vehicle fleets, staff and facilities; and writedowns of assets.
10/wsj_1071:Although Ryder didn't break out the charge, analysts estimated that the majority of the $57 million was linked to workers' compensation reserves and anticipated losses on the disposal of trucks. 
10/wsj_1071:Many analysts said they weren't surprised that problems in many of Ryder's lines of business continued to plague the company. "It pretty much confirms what we had been expecting," said Anthony Hatch, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. 
10/wsj_1071:But we're still at the beginning stages of some of these changes." He said the fourth quarter will be "challenging," and maintained his conservative forecast that 1990 "won't be a barn burner." 
10/wsj_1072:Robert L. Wood, 37-year-old chief financial officer, was named chairman and chief executive officer of this independent power producer, succeeding Raymond L. Hixson, 63.
10/wsj_1073:Advanced Medical Technologies Inc. said it purchased 93% of a unit of Henley Group Inc. 
10/wsj_1073:Advanced Medical paid $106 million in cash for its share in a unit of Henley's Fisher Scientific subsidiary.
10/wsj_1074:Maxicare Health Plans Inc., operating under Chapter 11 bankrupty-law protection, outlined terms of its reorganization plan that calls for creditors and shareholders to receive at least $78.8 million in cash and $67 million face amount of 10-year, 13.5% notes. 
10/wsj_1074:Maxicare, which filed for bankruptcy protection March 16, has total debt of $750 million.
10/wsj_1074:General unsecured creditors of Maxicare's continuing operations initially will receive $47 million in cash, $35 million face amount of senior notes, and 49% of the new company's stock.
10/wsj_1074:General unsecured creditors of Maxicare's discontinued operations, whose claims total $110 million, initially will receive $17.8 million in cash and $10 million in senior notes.
10/wsj_1074:Maxicare's public shareholders will receive 2% of the new company's stock and warrants entitling them to acquire as much as an additional 5% of the stock on a fully-diluted basis. 
10/wsj_1074:General unsecured creditors of the parent holding company initially will receive $14 million in cash, $22 million face amount of senior notes and 49% of the new company's stock.
10/wsj_1074:That group includes banks and bondholders, who have claims of $150 million and $350 million respectively.
10/wsj_1076:The average interest rate rose to 8.337% at Citicorp's $50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper, or corporate IOUs, from 8.292% at last week's sale. 
10/wsj_1076:However, Citicorp said that the average rate fell to 7.962% at its $50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper from 7.986% at last week's sale. 
10/wsj_1077:The satellite, built by Hughes for the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, is part of a $700 million contract awarded to Hughes in 1982 to develop five of the three-ton satellites. 
10/wsj_1078:Fiat's rejection of partnership with Saab means that the Swedish company, which announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49%, will have to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both Ford Motor Corp. and Fiat have turned down the offer. 
10/wsj_1079:Except for insurance, however, ITT said it expects improved operating earnings "in all of our businesses for the full year." 
10/wsj_1079:Hartford expects to report a further pretax loss of about $30 million for the current quarter, as a result of the California earthquake this month, ITT added. 
10/wsj_1079:Anticipating this settlement, the company recorded a pretax charge of $24 million during the fourth quarter of 1988.
10/wsj_1079:"The company's product businesses, with the exception of electronic components, had higher operating earnings for the first nine months of 1989," the company said.
10/wsj_1080:Amoco Corp. said it plans to install two platforms and drill as many as 22 wells to develop oil reserves it discovered in the Atlantic Ocean about 25 miles off the coast of Congo. 
10/wsj_1080:Amoco, an energy concern, is the operator of the project with a 43.75% working interest, and other partners include Hydro Congo, the Congolese state oil company, with a 50% interest, and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co. with a 6.25% stake.
10/wsj_1080:Production is expected to be about 40,000 barrels of oil a day after completion of the drilling program. 
10/wsj_1082:Bob Evans Inc. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as 500,000 shares of its common. 
10/wsj_1082:The restaurant operator had 32.2 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 29. 
10/wsj_1083:Coda Energy Inc. said it completed the sale of Phenix-Transmission Co. to Bishop Pipeline Co., for $17 million in cash and notes. 
10/wsj_1083:Coda owned 60% of the pipeline and private entities owned the rest. 
10/wsj_1084:The agency noted that because of a strike by Finance Ministry personnel the provisional estimate doesn't correspond exactly to the consumer price index usually published.
10/wsj_1084:The institute didn't estimate annual price growth in September, but a 0.2% rise by the consumer price index would put growth at either 178.8 or 178.9, up 3.3% or 3.4% from the year-earlier level of 173.1.
10/wsj_1085:International Technology Corp. and Davy McKee Corp., a unit of London's Davy Corp., said they were awarded a $55 million contract by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the closure of the Helen Kramer Landfill Superfund site in Mantua Township, N.J. 
10/wsj_1085:International Technology, an environmental management concern, said the contract includes construction of slurry walls, gas collection systems, a multilayer cap and water treatment plant. 
10/wsj_1086:U.S. Memories Inc., the venture that seeks to crack Japan's domination of the memory-chip market, said it has chosen four potential sites for its operations after a fierce bidding war by 15 states.

10/wsj_1090:Sun Microsystems Inc. said Prime Computer Inc. has agreed to resell as much as $200 million worth of Sun's machines over the next two years. 
10/wsj_1091:Quickview Systems Inc. said it filed a lawsuit against Apple Computer Inc., claiming patent infringement in an element of Apple's popular HyperCard software program. 
10/wsj_1091:The suit, filed in Minneapolis federal court, claims that Apple violated a Quickview patent that allows computer users to display "only portions of multiple fields on a computer screen with the ability to see the entire contents of any given field." 
10/wsj_1091:It's one of the most popular computer programs of all time, but analysts said the Quickview suit doesn't appear to bode major difficulties for Apple. 
10/wsj_1091:The technology at issue "is not an underlying technology of HyperCard to my knowledge," said Danny Goodman, a San Francisco-area HyperCard program developer. 
10/wsj_1091:Nonetheless, the suit seeks unspecified damages that an attorney for Quickview claimed could run into the millions of dollars. 
10/wsj_1091:In Cupertino, Calif., Apple said that it believes the case has no merit, and that HyperCard does not infringe "any valid claims" of the Quickview patents.
10/wsj_1091:It said it filed an action of its own in federal court in San Jose, Calif., seeking a declaration that Quickview's claims are invalid. 
10/wsj_1092:Though I agree with many of Mr. Kageyama's comments, I believe he points the gun in the wrong direction: It isn't the Americans who must be criticized for not understanding the Japanese culture, but the Japanese who insist on forcing their culture on Americans.
10/wsj_1092:Americans place native or native speakers in charge of subsidiaries overseas.
10/wsj_1092:While Mr. Kageyama does an excellent job of explaining the differences, both cultural and philosophic, I question his perspective. 
10/wsj_1092:Would he suggest that employees of an American company doing business in Japan conform to their new bosses' culture and philosophy?
10/wsj_1092:Thus the conclusion is that the burden rests with management to understand/adopt the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating.
10/wsj_1092:I believe Mr. Kageyama left out one major aspect of Japanese culture that permeated his piece: the belief in the superiority of Japanese culture and behavior vs. others. 
10/wsj_1092:A manager should not have to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management.
10/wsj_1092:Instead, he should listen to see how that criticism can be used constructively to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates.
10/wsj_1092:For Mr. Kageyama to argue that American employees must passively accept a direct imposition of the Japanese way of doing things is outright cultural chauvinism of the first order.
10/wsj_1092:The Japanese are neglecting the opportunity to synthesize a new corporate culture based on a fusion of the best aspects of both national cultures. 
10/wsj_1092:When the response to criticism is only a better explanation of policies without altering the reasons for the criticism, I am convinced that Mr. Kageyama has still failed to attack the root cause of the problem and is simply treating symptoms. 
10/wsj_1093:Generale des Eaux reported that net profit climbed 30% in the first half of 1989 and said that it expects a gain of about 25% for the full year. 
10/wsj_1093:The French water treatment group said consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests rose to 749 million francs (US$119.2 million) from 575 million francs in the first half of 1988.
10/wsj_1094:What did he think of the Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortion? 
10/wsj_1094:Then, two weeks ago -- declaring that "I'm not looking for any conflict over this" -- the president said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest. 
10/wsj_1094:The answer is so murky that it is beginning to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly vocal, increasingly powerful sides of the abortion issue.
10/wsj_1094:Anti-abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally. "In all honesty if you ask me, `Is this man a true believer? ' I don't know," says John Fowler, head of the Washington-based Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life Inc. Yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical.
10/wsj_1094:Douglas Gould, vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, calls Mr. Bush's position on the abortion-funding issue "extremely cruel," adding: "The guy hasn't done one thing about prevention.
10/wsj_1094:For most of the past nine years, he has striven to convince anti-abortion activists of his stalwart support for their position.
10/wsj_1094:Reproductive Health Services decision this year changed the political landscape of the abortion issue, the president seemingly has tried just as hard to avoid saying anything more unless pressed to the wall. 
10/wsj_1094:By his moderate Republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who say the issue is vital to younger voters, the president might seem to have at least some sympathy with abortion-rights arguments.
10/wsj_1094:Yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the White House.
10/wsj_1094:But Mr. Bush and his advisers miscalculated the politics of the abortion issue, failing to grasp how dramatically the abortion-rights movement would be aroused following last summer's Supreme Court decision to restrict those rights in the Webster case. 
10/wsj_1094:"It was one of the quickest changes in public attitudes I've ever seen," says former Reagan pollster Richard Wirthlin. 
10/wsj_1094:These days, when others raise the subject of abortion, the usually loquacious president can be close-mouthed almost to the point of curtness.
10/wsj_1094:A close look at his record over the last 15 years suggests that Mr. Bush has well-stated his views -- on all sides of the issue. 
10/wsj_1094:In 1974, as the U.S. representative to the United Nations, he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he boasted of his leadership during his term in Congress in expanding family-planning services for the poor.
10/wsj_1094:Running for president in early 1980, he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. 
10/wsj_1094:Throughout the early 1980s, Mr. Bush was quoted sometimes supporting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest and sometimes opposing it.
10/wsj_1094:In April 1986, then-Vice President Bush had his staff write a letter spelling out that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape, incest and life endangerment, but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case.
10/wsj_1094:His rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office, affirming his "firm support of our cause" during an anti-abortion rally three days after his inauguration last January.
10/wsj_1094:He again urged passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion. 
10/wsj_1094:When the ruling was handed down, the vacationing president dispatched Chief of Staff John Sununu to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself.
10/wsj_1094:He did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the District of Columbia's right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the United Nations Population Fund.
10/wsj_1094:What few comments he has initiated have been oblique, such as urging "greater efforts toward the protection of human life" at a meeting of Catholic lawyers in Boston last month. 
10/wsj_1094:The White House has likewise avoided any involvement in Florida's recent special legislative session on abortion, which anti-abortion forces had regarded as a key test of their ability to get state lawmakers to toughen abortion restrictions.
10/wsj_1094:Ken Ruberg, head of the Republican Mainstream Committee, a group of party moderates, observes: "The administration finds itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult -- if not impossible -- to get itself out of." 
10/wsj_1095:When we look closely at our own history, it is clear that our constitutionally mandated civil rights have evolved not through the goodness of people's hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments.
10/wsj_1095:Disabled Americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since Section 504 was passed as a part of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.
10/wsj_1095:Those who fear a plethora of suits paralyzing our legal system need only look at the record on the Rehabilitation Act.
10/wsj_1095:Without legal recourse, there are no guarantees of civil rights for anyone. 
10/wsj_1096:Ford Motor Co. said it is consolidating control of its Asian operations under a new organization here that will be headed by W. Wayne Booker. 
10/wsj_1096:Ford Asia-Pacific will coordinate the activities of Ford subsidiaries in Japan, Australia, Taiwan and New Zealand and work with Ford business associates throughout the region.
10/wsj_1096:These functions are currently performed out of Melbourne, Australia, and at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. 
10/wsj_1096:Mr. Booker, executive director of Ford's Latin America Automotive Operations since December 1988, was named vice president of Ford Asia-Pacific. 
10/wsj_1097:In the year-ago period, Goodyear had net of $63.5 million, or $1.11 a share. 
10/wsj_1097:Donald DeScenza, an independent analyst in New Canaan, Conn., said he was "impressed with the company's performance." He said results were better than he'd expected and indicate that Goodyear is in the midst of a turnaround from a string of lackluster quarters that have plagued the company for a year. 
10/wsj_1097:However, Harry Millis, an analyst at McDonald & Co., Cleveland, said Goodyear's results "fell at the bottom" of his range of estimates.
10/wsj_1097:Excluding an increase in the tax rate and the effects of foreign currency translations, Mr. Millis said the company's results "were still a little disappointing." 
10/wsj_1097:The Akron, Ohio-based company said pretax operating income in its tire segment jumped about 31% to $196.2 million from $150.2 million a year earlier, reflecting improvements in raw material costs, sales of replacement tires and pricing. 
10/wsj_1097:McDonald's Mr. Millis said Goodyear appeared to have held or gained some market share in the U.S. for the first time since the second quarter of 1988. 
10/wsj_1097:Total tire segment sales were up only about 1% to $2.2 billion, and the company said it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its U.S. tire plants because of inventory adjustments and slackened production by auto makers. 
10/wsj_1097:For the nine months, profit skidded about 35%, reflecting charges taken in this year's second quarter and the effect of translations of weaker foreign currencies into the stronger U.S. dollar. 
10/wsj_1097:Net was $192.1 million, or $3.33 a share, compared with net of $293.7 million, or $5.13 a share, the year earlier. 
10/wsj_1097:The latest nine months included charges of $95 million related to the company's South African subsidiary and unused pipe sold by its crude oil pipeline unit. 
10/wsj_1098:The environmental services company said that the discontinuation of unsuccessful product lines and an increase in baddebt reserves probably will result in charges of $2.5 million to $4 million, most of which will be taken against third-quarter results. 
10/wsj_1098:In the year-ago quarter, the company reported earnings of $2.2 million, or 35 cents a share. 
10/wsj_1099:A battle with Mr. Icahn would rattle even the most seasoned chief executive, to say nothing of one who took the helm less than five months ago. 
10/wsj_1099:In addition, USX's giant steel segment, representing 34% of its 1988 sales, is facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low-cost minimills.
10/wsj_1099:The import quotas got only a 2 1/2-year extension, and USX is laboring under a staggering $5.8 billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil. "It's a baptism of fire for Corry," says one USX executive. 
10/wsj_1099:Or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying Mr. Icahn's stock, possibly at a premium, or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of Mr. Icahn's pressure. 
10/wsj_1099:With his recent purchases of USX common stock, Mr. Icahn shattered a three-year-old, unwritten standstill agreement with Mr. Roderick.
10/wsj_1099:Mr. Roderick did so by having USX redeem a series of guaranteed notes, a move that, in effect, raised the cost of a $7.19 billion Icahn bid by about $3 billion.
10/wsj_1099:He was shocked, associates say, to learn of Mr. Icahn's new takeover threat. (Both men declined to be interviewed for this article.) But the fiercely competitive Mr. Corry quickly showed he's no pushover.
10/wsj_1099:Will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of USX into separate oil and steel companies?
10/wsj_1099:Given the weakness of the junk-bond market, can he finance a buy-out?
10/wsj_1099:And although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk-bond markets, by making it harder to arrange takeover financing, has eased some of the pressure on Mr. Corry, it doesn't end the takeover threat. "I know it's not over," a sober-faced Mr. Corry acknowledged while greeting steel suppliers in New York on Oct. 12 and inviting them to a buffet of salmon and sushi in honor of Kobe Steel Ltd., USX's partner in a steel mill in Lorain, Ohio. 
10/wsj_1099:The 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive.
10/wsj_1099:An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he couldn't stand cutting up frogs, Mr. Corry wanted to work for a big company "that could do big things." But after joining the tax department of a USX subsidiary 30 years ago, he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46.
10/wsj_1099:For years, he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms, wearing a hat to work because everyone else did. "I was never a rebel," he said in an earlier interview. "I don't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they've seen me pound the table or get angry." 
10/wsj_1099:He served as Mr. Roderick's front man in tense negotiations for the 1982 purchase of Marathon Oil for $5.9 billion. 
10/wsj_1099:Nevertheless, Mr. Corry, once named chief executive, didn't waste any time distancing himself from his former boss, who still has an office on the 62nd floor of the USX tower in Pittsburgh.
10/wsj_1099:Soon after taking over last June, Mr. Corry rescinded a pay cut imposed on clerical workers, a move that Mr. Roderick hadn't made in spite of improved earnings.
10/wsj_1099:Mr. Corry also ruled that all board meetings would be held in Pittsburgh instead of New York or Findlay, Ohio, Marathon's home. 
10/wsj_1099:And, earlier this month, he announced the sale of the reserves of Texas Oil & Gas, which was acquired three years ago and hasn't posted any significant operating profits since.
10/wsj_1099:One former executive says, "Nobody wanted that deal inside USX except Dave Roderick," who was a hunting and fishing buddy of William L. Hutchison, chairman of Texas Oil & Gas.
10/wsj_1099:What miffed many USX executives and shareholders was that the acquisition, for $3 billion of stock, doubled the USX shares outstanding and considerably diluted them.
10/wsj_1099:But when the two men met in New York a day after Mr. Icahn disclosed the rise in his USX stake, Mr. Corry learned that Mr. Icahn wanted him to sell all of Texas Oil -- not just its reserves of about 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 28 million barrels of oil but also its pipeline, gas-gathering and contract-drilling operations.
10/wsj_1099:The stock closed yesterday at $33.625, giving Mr. Icahn's 33.6 million shares a value of $1.13 billion. 
10/wsj_1099:Mr. Icahn advocates the sale of the company's steel operations, and Mr. Corry doesn't necessarily disagree.
10/wsj_1099:While Mr. Roderick was reared in the shadows of Pittsburgh's smoking mills, Mr. Corry grew up in Cincinnati, a city nicknamed "Porkapolis" and more accustomed to pork chops than pig iron.
10/wsj_1099:He has never met Lynn Williams, the president of the United Steelworkers union, and isn't active in the industry's main trade group, the American Iron and Steel Institute, which Mr. Roderick served as chairman. 
10/wsj_1099:However, shedding steel would run directly counter to Mr. Roderick's original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas: Having two major products would lessen the company's vulnerability to one market's down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings.
10/wsj_1099:As Mr. Roderick once said: "We're a two-product company and, boy, if you can't figure out the value of those two parts, you are so damn dumb that you don't belong on Wall Street." 
10/wsj_1099:About the only way that USX now can get out of steel is to dish it out, piece by piece, in separate joint ventures, he adds. 
10/wsj_1099:However, even USX executives who work closely with him aren't sure about his long-term goals. "I don't think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go," one says.
10/wsj_1099:Mr. Corry learned presence under fire when, as vice president of corporate planning, he handled what Mr. Johnston calls "don't-con-me" negotiations that led to USX's shedding of a wide array of assets ranging from chemicals to construction. 
10/wsj_1099:"It's part of the capitalistic market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought," he said.
10/wsj_1099:USX, he noted, was formed 88 years ago, "by in effect buying out a bunch of other companies. . . . People got rich through takeovers in those days, as they do today." 
11/wsj_1101:Israeli counterterrorism officials provided the State Department with a 20-page list of recent terrorist incidents they attribute directly to forces controlled by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
11/wsj_1101:A U.S. counterterrorism official said experts are studying the Israeli list. "We have no independent evidence linking Fatah to any acts of terrorism since Dec. 15, 1988," he said, referring to the specific PLO group that Mr. Arafat heads. "So far, this list doesn't change our view.
11/wsj_1101:Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's top adviser on counterterrorism, Yigal Carmon, was here Monday to present the report to members of Congress, reporters and others.
11/wsj_1101:The State Department said it hasn't yet seen copies of those papers. 
11/wsj_1101:"If the dialogue was based on the assumption that Arafat or the PLO would stop terrorism, and we have evidence of continued terrorism, what would be the logical conclusion?" Mr. Carmon asked. 
11/wsj_1101:Now, Jerusalem says it is backing up its contention with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to Mr. Arafat.
11/wsj_1101:It blames most of these on Fatah. 
11/wsj_1101:At the heart of Israel's report is a list of a dozen incidents Jerusalem attributes to Fatah, including the use of bombs and Molotov cocktails.
11/wsj_1101:But U.S. officials say they aren't satisfied these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be offshoots of the intifadah, the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories, which the U.S. doesn't classify as terrorism.
11/wsj_1101:U.S. terrorism experts also say they are highly uncertain about the veracity of the separate documents leaked to the New York Times.
11/wsj_1101:The papers, which Israel says were discovered in Israeli-occupied Gaza, refer to terrorist acts to be carried out in the name of a group called "the Revolutionary Eagles." 
11/wsj_1101:Some supporters of Israel say U.S. policy on Palestinian terrorism is colored by an intense desire to maintain the dialogue with the PLO.
11/wsj_1101:But State Department officials accuse Israel of leaking questionable claims to embarrass the U.S. 
11/wsj_1102:When the DJIA modestly rebounded, the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings but ended the day below the levels of late Monday.
11/wsj_1102:In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.57 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 142.10 yen. 
11/wsj_1102:He argues that the dollar is now "moving sideways," adding that "the next leg could be the beginning of a longer term bearish phase." 
11/wsj_1102:Despite several spurts of dollar trading, it was noted that mark-yen cross trade grabbed much of the market's attention. 
11/wsj_1102:But, they add that the mark's strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from U.S. assets by Japanese investors into West German investments. 
11/wsj_1102:Some dealers say that Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita's reassurance that Japanese monetary policy won't be changed for the time being has given investors an added excuse to push the yen down even further against the mark. 
11/wsj_1102:Despite the yen's weakness with respect to the mark, Tokyo traders say they don't expect the Bank of Japan to take any action to support the Japanese currency on that front. 
11/wsj_1102:The news also knocked the British unit to below 2.95 marks in London, but a bout of short-covering helped sterling recoup some of its earlier losses. 
11/wsj_1103:In 1988, for example, Boston Co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $110 million, while Shearson managed net income of just $96 million. 
11/wsj_1103:Shearson doesn't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries.
11/wsj_1103:But people familiar with Boston Co. 's performance say the unit had profit of around $17 million for the third quarter, after barely breaking even for the first six months.
11/wsj_1103:Shearson, meanwhile, posted net income of $106 million for the first nine months of the year, down slightly from $110 million for the year-ago period. 
11/wsj_1103:Moody's Investors Service Inc. last week downgraded the long-term deposit rating of Boston Co. 's Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co. subsidiary, to single-A-1 from double-A-3, citing problems in the company's "aggressively managed securities portfolio." 
11/wsj_1103:John Kriz, a Moody's vice president, said Boston Safe Deposit's performance has been hurt this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities.
11/wsj_1103:The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk, and when rates moved unfavorably -- beginning late last year and continuing into this year -- "it cost them," Mr. Kriz said. 
11/wsj_1103:Boston Co. officials declined to comment on Moody's action or on the unit's financial performance this year -- except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters' results. 
11/wsj_1103:An accounting controversy at the end of last year forced Boston Co. to admit it had overstated pretax profits by some $44 million.
11/wsj_1103:The resulting scandal led to the firing of James N. von Germeten as Boston Co. 's president and to the resignations of the company's chief financial officer and treasurer.
11/wsj_1103:The executives were accused of improperly deferring expenses and booking revenue early, in an effort to dress up results -- and perhaps bolster performance-related bonuses.
11/wsj_1103:Mr. von Germeten, in turn, attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants and accused Shearson of conducting a "witch hunt." 
11/wsj_1103:Mr. Kriz of Moody's said the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions taken last year.
11/wsj_1104:Mexico exported an average of 1,296,800 barrels of crude oil a day at an average of $15.31 a barrel during 1989's first eight months for a total of $4.82 billion, Petroleos Mexicanos S.A. said. 
11/wsj_1104:The state petroleum monopoly said sales in the period gained 15%, and $262.4 million more than originally projected at an average of $10 a barrel on an export platform of 1,250,000 barrels a day. 
11/wsj_1105:Sears said its U.S. stores had a loss of $6.9 million, their first deficit for the period in more than five years.
11/wsj_1105:The results underscore Sears's difficulties in implementing the "everyday low pricing" strategy that it adopted in March as part of a broad attempt to revive its retailing business.
11/wsj_1105:Sears officials insist they don't intend to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results.
11/wsj_1105:Instead, a spokesman blames the dismal third-quarter showing on "an environment that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods," which account for roughly two-thirds of Sears's annual merchandise volume. 
11/wsj_1105:Sears has been counting on growth coming from the large displays of brand-name merchandise it is adding to its stores over the next two years in what it calls "power formats." 
11/wsj_1105:But analysts say Sears faces an especially daunting challenge on the eve of the Christmas shopping season. "I believe everyday pricing in the current environment doesn't work," says Walter Loeb of Morgan Stanley & Co., pointing to soft durable-goods sales. "Sears is likely to be unsuccessful if it continues with its pricing policy when everyone else is offering unusual values." 
11/wsj_1105:Recent surveys by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a market research firm in Chicago, suggest that Sears is having a tough time attracting shoppers because it hasn't yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise.
11/wsj_1105:The number of people who said they were more likely to shop at Sears fell in September to 37% from 66% in March, when Sears blanketed the airwaves with ads about its new pricing strategy. 
11/wsj_1105:Moreover, the number of people who spontaneously cited lower prices as the reason for their interest in Sears declined to 16% in September from 33% in March.
11/wsj_1105:Just 5% of the respondents mentioned brands in September, up slightly from 2% in March.
11/wsj_1105:Only 2% of the people in September cited Sears's "friendly personnel." 
11/wsj_1105:"The power of price as an appeal, which was very considerable in driving traffic in March and April, has diminished," says George Rosenbaum, president of Shapiro & Associates. "You see some improvement in these other areas, but it's a very small and slow process." 
11/wsj_1105:Profit at Sears's Allstate insurance unit fell 38% to $126.1 million because of Hurricane Hugo, which inflicted the greatest single storm damage loss in the company's history.
11/wsj_1105:Profit at Sears's Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group nearly quadrupled to $81.2 million because of gains on sales of property. 
11/wsj_1106:Oil imports to Japan rose 12% in September from year-earlier levels, according to statistics released by the government's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
11/wsj_1106:The year-on-year rise was partly because of higher demand for petroleum products, and partly because of tax changes in 1988 that left oil companies with high inventories in the late-summer/early-FALL PERIOD. 
11/wsj_1106:Imports of crude from the Middle East grew 17% from year-earlier levels, and Southeast Asian crude imports grew 43%. 
11/wsj_1107:Unused houses deteriorate rapidly, affecting the value of nearby homes; in a domino effect, the entire neighborhood can fall victim.
11/wsj_1107:But most of them could have afforded to keep up their payments -- they chose not to do so. 
11/wsj_1107:2) Encourage long-term occupancy by forgiving one month's payment (off the tail end of the mortgage) for every six months paid; or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage (balloon), but "forgiven" on a monthly pro-rata basis as long as the owner remains the occupant. 
11/wsj_1107:The Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development further aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock by "buying in" to their foreclosed properties (of which there are, alas, many) at an inflated "balance due" -- say $80,000 on a house worth $55,000 -- instead of allowing a free market to price the house for what it's really worth. 
11/wsj_1107:Worse, the properties then sit around deteriorating for maybe a year or so, but are resold eventually (because of the attractiveness of the low down payment, etc.) to a marginal buyer who can't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs; and having little vested interest that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle repeats itself all over again. 
11/wsj_1108:Italy's unemployment rate rose to 12% of the labor force in July from 11.9% in April, and was up from 11.7% a year earlier, according to quarterly figures from the state statistical institute. 
11/wsj_1108:Istat said a national survey during the first week of July showed the number of job seekers was 2,888,000 up from 2,822,000 in April, and from 2,853,000 a year ago. 
11/wsj_1109:Sales of Xerox copiers and other office products grew 1.6%; "we expected growth of 6% to 7%," Mr. Henderson said.
11/wsj_1109:Operating-profit margins slipped almost 18%, to 4.3% of sales, the analyst noted. 
11/wsj_1109:Still, with competitors such as Eastman Kodak Co. faltering in copier sales, Xerox's sales increases "were encouraging," says Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "They are holding their own in a weak market, and the restructuring is working," he says. 
11/wsj_1109:Mr. Glazer expects Xerox to experience tough sledding, though, in financial services because of rate pressures and uncertainty surrounding tax treatment of capital gains. 
11/wsj_1109:In the quarter, the Crum & Forster insurance unit reported $200 million before tax of capital gains from property and casualty operations.
11/wsj_1110:New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September after shooting up the month before, reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models, the Commerce Department reported. 
11/wsj_1110:Moreover, a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl. 
11/wsj_1110:While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably didn't factor out all of the wide-ranging surge in defense orders. 
11/wsj_1110:Analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping.
11/wsj_1110:Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row, posting a 5.6% drop after a 10.3% decline.
11/wsj_1110:Such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy.
11/wsj_1110:Still, Milton Hudson, senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York, said: "If you look back a half-year or so the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector.
11/wsj_1110:Now at least there are question marks about that, and without any question the pace of growth has slowed." 
11/wsj_1111:Norfolk Southern Corp. directors authorized the railroad company to buy back as many as 45 million of its shares, which would have a current value of more than $1.7 billion. 
11/wsj_1111:The buy-back, coupled with a nearly completed earlier purchase of 20 million shares, would reduce shares outstanding by more than 26%.
11/wsj_1111:Still, analysts don't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term. "The impact won't be that great," said Graeme Lidgerwood of First Boston Corp.
11/wsj_1111:That is in part because of the effect of having to average the number of shares outstanding, she said.
11/wsj_1111:It has purchased about 19 million of them. 
11/wsj_1112:John B. Curcio, 55 years old, resigned as chairman of this diesel truck manufacturer, effective upon appointment of a successor.
11/wsj_1112:Last month, Mr. Curcio was succeeded by Ralph E. Reins as chief executive officer following several quarters of lackluster or declining performance. 
11/wsj_1113:Completion of the sale is expected early next year, Falcon said. 
11/wsj_1113:Currently, Falcon has about 750,000 cable-television subscribers around the nation; the company's cable-television unit reported 1988 revenue of about $100 million. 
11/wsj_1114:Richard W. Lock, retired vice president and treasurer of Owens-Illinois Inc., was named a director of this transportation industry supplier, increasing its board to six members. 
11/wsj_1115:USX Corp. said it delayed the proposed initial public offering of common stock of RMI Titanium Co. because of market conditions. 
11/wsj_1116:Your Oct. 2 editorial "Reding, Wrighting & Erithmatic" on the recent "education summit" was like most pieces on the subject of education: It had little to say.
11/wsj_1116:Oddly, though, on the very same page you printed a comment that addresses one of the most serious shortcomings of the American education system.
11/wsj_1116:What far too many people concerned about education either fail to understand or choose to ignore is that American children, on the whole, are among the most undisciplined in the world, making any attempt at improvements in the mode of education potentially unsuccessful.
11/wsj_1117:Retired Adm. William J. Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Robert P. Luciano, chairman and chief executive officer of Schering-Plough Corp., were elected directors of this securities firm.
11/wsj_1118:Reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $1 million or more.
11/wsj_1118:COMMERCIAL PAPER: High-grade unsecured notes sold through dealers by major corporations in multiples of $1,000: 8.55% 30 days; 8.475% 60 days; 8.45% 90 days. 
11/wsj_1118:CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT: 8.09% one month; 8.09% two months; 8.06% three months; 8% six months; 7.94% one year.
11/wsj_1118:Average of top rates paid by major New York banks on primary new issues of negotiable C.D.s, usually on amounts of $1 million and more.
11/wsj_1118:The average of interbank offered rates for dollar deposits in the London market based on quotations at five major banks. 
11/wsj_1118:TREASURY BILLS: Results of the Monday, October 23, 1989, auction of short-term U.S. government bills, sold at a discount from face value in units of $10,000 to $1 million: 7.52% 13 weeks; 7.50% 26 weeks. 
11/wsj_1118:Annualized average rate of return after expenses for the past 30 days; not a forecast of future returns. 
11/wsj_1119:The appointment increased the number of directors to 10, three of whom are company employees.
11/wsj_1120:Japan has climbed up from the ashes of World War II and a gross national product of about $800 per capita to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations.
11/wsj_1120:Now this remarkable economic growth seems to be coming to an end because the government has not converted itself into a modern, democratic, "developed nation" mode of operation. 
11/wsj_1120:Until 1980, when Japan joined the $10,000 per capita GNP club of the advanced countries, it was a model developing nation.
11/wsj_1120:It gave the Japanese people a value system, based on the rationalization that given the country's lack of natural resources, they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus.
11/wsj_1120:The standard of living has increased steadily over the past 40 years; more than 90% of the people consider themselves middle class. 
11/wsj_1120:In a modern system, the government's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice.
11/wsj_1120:The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions.
11/wsj_1120:The Ministry of Health and Welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people.
11/wsj_1120:The Ministry of Education is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers, and certainly does not act on behalf of students.
11/wsj_1120:The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that Japan's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world, but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic.
11/wsj_1120:The Ministry of Transportation serves the industry, certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices. 
11/wsj_1120:And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs works for itself, supporting Japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host's.
11/wsj_1120:This ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of Japan's deteriorating image.
11/wsj_1120:Instead, it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries. 
11/wsj_1120:The rest of the world accepted such methods when Japan was developing.
11/wsj_1120:The Diet doesn't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever LDP does that it would be a waste of time.
11/wsj_1120:So most bills are passed without full discussion; particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties. 
11/wsj_1120:This makes enormous sense in Japan, where direct tax accounts for more than 70% of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair.
11/wsj_1120:But the bill was passed without debate in the Diet, in the absence of the opposition.
11/wsj_1120:All of a sudden, prices were no longer in denominations of 100 or 200.
11/wsj_1120:Money, such as in Recruit's political donations, and women, as in the cases of Prime Minister Sosuke Uno and Secretary General Tokuo Yamashita, seldom have caused political scandals in Japan.
11/wsj_1120:In the recent Upper House and Tokyo metropolitan congressional elections, in which the Socialist Party won a runaway victory, 60% of all women voted, as opposed to the usual 40%.
11/wsj_1120:It is difficult to analyze how much of their anger was due to Recruit, the sex scandals, or the one-yen coins in their purses, but they obviously were voting to punish the LDP. 
11/wsj_1120:The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty can continue, sort of.
11/wsj_1120:Against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the Socialist Party the LDP has been paralyzed.
11/wsj_1120:Now is the time to reform the government from a provider, developing-country vanguard role to that of a modern, industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice.
11/wsj_1120:The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP, representing the manufacturers' preference for larger government, control, regulation and protectionism. 
11/wsj_1120:In the current mood of the Japanese people, journalists and even some industrialists, giving power to the Socialists might be good for the LDP, cleansing it of past sins.
11/wsj_1120:We must not forget, however, that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets.
11/wsj_1120:Mr. Ohmae is managing director of McKinsey & Co. in Japan. 
11/wsj_1121:But only after a fleet of 336 gargantuan earthmoving vehicles belonging to De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's diamond kingpins, do their work.
11/wsj_1121:Last year, 43 million tons of desert were moved from one dune to another to recover 934,242 carats, which comes to 46 tons of sand per carat, or one-fifth gram.
11/wsj_1121:Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature -- first in the gentle current of the Orange River that carried the stones from South Africa's interior, then in the cold surf of the ocean, and finally in the coarse sands of the desert -- 98% of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality.
11/wsj_1121:While other mines might yield more carats, a higher percentage of them go to industrial use. 
11/wsj_1121:Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic -- a restricted area, a designation normally reserved for military operations.
11/wsj_1121:When the Germans lost World War I, they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers.
11/wsj_1121:Today, no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De Beers's stingy approval. 
11/wsj_1121:The mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in Africa.
11/wsj_1121:Oranjemund, the mine headquarters, is a lonely corporate oasis of 9,000 residents.
11/wsj_1121:On most days, the desert's heat and the cool of the ocean combine to create a mist like a damp rag.
11/wsj_1121:Still, miners from all parts of Namibia as well as professional staff from De Beers's head offices in South Africa and London keep coming.
11/wsj_1121:The pride of Oranjemund is the 18-hole golf course -- with the largest sand trap in the world.
11/wsj_1121:Despite fears the mine may be partially nationalized by the new Namibian government following next month's elections freeing the country from South African control, De Beers engineers are working to extend the mine's productive life for another 25 years, from the current estimate of 10. 
11/wsj_1121:Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters; a whirring ferris wheellike excavator, with buckets instead of seats, chews through layers of compacted sand; tracks and conveyor belts, shuttling sand to the screening plants, criss-cross the beach. 
11/wsj_1121:Made of sand, it receives around-the-clock maintainence against the battering waves.
11/wsj_1121:When the mining in front of the wall is complete, it is moved northward.
11/wsj_1121:Despite all these innovations, most of the diamonds are still found in the sand swept away by the men wielding shovels and brushes -- the ignominiously named "bedrock sweepers" who toil in the wake of the excavators.
11/wsj_1121:For these workers at the bottom of the mine's pay scale, this is usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal -- a crime that could earn them up to 15 years in jail. 
11/wsj_1121:One man wrapped several diamonds in the knot of his tie.
11/wsj_1121:Another poked a hole in the heel of his shoe.
11/wsj_1121:A food caterer stashed stones in the false bottom of a milk pail.
11/wsj_1121:None made it past the body searches and X-rays of mine security. 
11/wsj_1122:Just after Hurricane Hugo battered South Carolina, some officials talked of perhaps adding a penny to the state gasoline tax or raising property taxes.
11/wsj_1122:As a result of an erroneous IRS levy on a bank account, a taxpayer may incur administrative and overdraft charges.
11/wsj_1122:If the IRS seeks late-payment interest because of the lost check, you should request interest abatement, publisher Prentice Hall notes. 
11/wsj_1122:But, IRS private ruling 8940061 notes, no rule or court case bears directly on the issue of adding land to a principal residence.
11/wsj_1122:So the IRS has drawn a rationale from the sale of a home site split in two and sold in different years to the same buyer; a court let the seller in that old case treat this as the sale of one residence. 
11/wsj_1122:REPORTS OF PAYMENTS to independent contractors for services must be filed by businesses, but don't bet that contractors' unreported income will be detected that way.
11/wsj_1122:The General Accounting Office estimates that 50% of IRS audits don't spot companies that fail to file the reports. 
11/wsj_1122:UH HUH: A claim by Peter Testa of New York that a stranger paid him $500 to go into a bank and change $44,400 in small bills into large bills "is unconvincing," the Tax Court found.
11/wsj_1122:It held that Testa is taxable on $44,400 of unreported income. 
11/wsj_1122:He plans to tell clients to pay certain fees directly to the foundation instead of to him; he would omit those fees from income reported on his return.
11/wsj_1122:The rule goes back at least as far as a 1930 Supreme Court decision, Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton says.
11/wsj_1122:If you assign your income to another, you still have controlled its disposition and enjoyed the fruits of your labor, even if indirectly. 
11/wsj_1122:Ben earns any fees sent directly to charity and is taxable on them, the IRS says; of course, he also may take a charitable deduction for them. 
11/wsj_1123:Blue-chip advertisers have plenty of complaints about the magazines they advertise in, ranging from inadequate consumer research to ad "clutter" and a seemingly unchecked proliferation of special interest magazines. 
11/wsj_1123:"Magazines are not providing us in-depth information on circulation," said Edgar Bronfman Jr., president and chief operating officer of Seagram, in a panel discussion. "How do readers feel about the magazine?
11/wsj_1123:Reuben Mark, chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive, said advertisers lack detailed demographic and geographic breakdowns of magazines' audiences. "We need research that convinces us that magazines are a real value in reader's lives, that readers are really involved." 
11/wsj_1123:The critics also lambasted the magazine industry for something executives often are very proud of: the growth in magazine titles during the 1980s.
11/wsj_1123:Leonard Lauder, president and chief executive officer of Estee Lauder, said consumer magazines are suffering from what he called "niche-itis,"the increasing number of magazines that target the idosyncratic interests of readers. 
11/wsj_1123:Mr. Lauder also attacked what he sees as the wide imitation of Elle, a fashion magazine published by Diamandis Communications Inc., and criticized the practice of stacking ads at the front of magazines. "Readers don't want to face all those ad pages at the front of a magazine," he said. 
11/wsj_1123:Magazine editors did not take the criticisms lying down. "We spend a fortune on research information," said Steve Burzon, publisher of Meredith Corp. 's Metropolitan Home. 
11/wsj_1123:And Tina Brown, editor of Conde Nast Publications Inc. 's Vanity Fair, said advertisers are frequently asked to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine to relieve ad clutter. "But advertisers wouldn't think of it," she said. 
11/wsj_1123:Bernard Leser, president of Conde Nast, added: "Our research shows we sell more of our heavier issues . . . because readers believe they are getting more for what they pay for." 
11/wsj_1124:But some analysts say Salomon has turned the corner. "I upgraded the firm to my buy list because I certainly see signs of improvement," says Lawrence Eckenfelder, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. "The market has been overly harsh to them." 
11/wsj_1124:Analysts say investors remain skittish toward Salomon because of its volatile earnings.
11/wsj_1124:In the first quarter, Salomon had a record loss of $28 million on revenue of $1.54 billion.
11/wsj_1124:But in the second quarter, Salomon posted a record $253 million net on revenue of $2.33 billion. 
11/wsj_1125:That's the word expected to be on the lips of the more than 3,000 developers, pension-fund advisers and real estate financiers slated to attend a four-day conference, beginning here today, sponsored by the Urban Land Institute.
11/wsj_1125:Developers and money managers are looking for bargains among the thousands of financially troubled properties around the country.
11/wsj_1125:Conference attendees are expected to be buzzing about the workings of the recently formed Resolution Trust Corp., a federal agency charged with disposing of an estimated $200 billion of real estate dumped in government hands by insolvent savings and loans. 
11/wsj_1125:Developers are also eyeing the real estate portfolios of major corporations.
11/wsj_1125:The builders are more willing to give up some equity and rely on management and consulting fees to stay afloat in the soft market. "Developers are teaming up with institutions often acting as project managers," says Smedes York, ULI president and president of York Properties Inc., of Raleigh, N.C. "They are growing more pragmatic about their role." 
11/wsj_1125:Real estate firms are also using their alliances with financial institutions to amass acquisition funds. "Why should you beat your brains out fighting the environmentalists, the neighborhood groups, dealing with traffic mitigation, sewers and fighting city hall, then try to convince a lender to lend you money in an overbuilt market when you can get pension fund money, buy a portfolio, sell off pieces off it and play your own game?" says Jack Rodman, managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Kenneth Leventhal Inc. a national accounting firm. 
11/wsj_1125:The level of interest in the RTC's properties has been greater than expected, and has come from larger companies than initially anticipated, says Stan Ross, Leventhal's co-managing partner.
11/wsj_1125:And to succeed in the turnaround business, he says, developers may have to put in a lot of money and time. 
11/wsj_1125:Quips David Shulman, director of real estate research for Salomon Brothers Inc.: "A theme of the Urban Land conference will be `take a pension fund manager to lunch. '" 
11/wsj_1126:Sheraton Corp. and Pan American World Airways announced that they and two Soviet partners will construct two "world-class" hotels within a mile of Red Square in Moscow. 
11/wsj_1126:U.S. and Soviet officials hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations. "This is an outstanding example of how the East and the West can work together for their mutual benefit and progress," said Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, who hosted a signing ceremony for the venture's partners at the Soviet embassy here. 
11/wsj_1126:Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who attended the ceremony, called the undertaking a "historic step" in the evolution of U.S.-Soviet ties.
11/wsj_1126:One of the hotels, to be called the Sheraton Moscow, will have 450 rooms and will cost an estimated $75 million to build.
11/wsj_1126:Sheraton, a subsidiary of ITT Corp., will have a 40% share in the two hotels; Pan American, a subsidiary of Pan Am Corp., will have a 10% share.
11/wsj_1126:U.S. companies account for less than 8% of the 1,000 or more Soviet joint ventures that have been announced since the Soviets began encouraging such undertakings in 1987.
11/wsj_1126:The Sheraton Moscow will charge about $140 to $150 a day for each of its rooms, and it will accept payment only in currencies that can be traded in foreign exchange markets, according to a Sheraton executive. 
11/wsj_1126:Thomas Plaskett, Pan Am's chairman, said the U.S. airline's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements with Aeroflot to jointly operate nonstop New York-Moscow flights.
11/wsj_1126:He said the rising volume of passenger traffic on this route justifies a major investment in new high-standard Moscow hotels. 
11/wsj_1127:David Shaffer was named to the new post of executive vice president of the Maxwell Macmillan group of this communications giant.
11/wsj_1127:He had been group vice president of the electronic-publishing group.
11/wsj_1128:Soichiro Honda's picture now hangs with Henry Ford's in the U.S. Automotive Hall of Fame, and the game-show "Jeopardy" is soon to be Sony-owned.
11/wsj_1128:By 1995 it will be planted more often than any other apple tree, according to a recent survey of six apple-industry sages by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton.
11/wsj_1128:Some fruit visionaries say the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America's apple heap. 
11/wsj_1128:Compared to the Red Delicious, the exemplar of apple pulchritude, the Fuji is decidedly more dowdy -- generally smaller, less-perfectly shaped, greenish, with tinges of red.
11/wsj_1128:It has more sugar "than any apple we've ever tested," says Duane Greene, a University of Massachusetts pomologist, or apple scholar.
11/wsj_1128:Mr. Auvil, razor sharp at 83, has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past 65 years.
11/wsj_1128:He is known as the father of the U.S.-grown Granny Smith, a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on.
11/wsj_1128:Now, even more radical changes seem afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed. "The Fuji is going to be No. 1 to replace the Red Delicious," he says. 
11/wsj_1128:For more than 50 years, it has been the apple of our eye.
11/wsj_1128:But the apple industry is ripe for change. "Red Delicious has been overplanted, and its prices have dropped below the cost of production," says Washington State's Mr. Norton.
11/wsj_1128:The glut and consequent lower prices, combined with cancer fears, was a very serious blow to growers. "A lot of growers won't be around in a few years," says Mr. Norton, although they have stopped using Alar. 
11/wsj_1128:One may be William Broderick, a Sterling, Mass., grower. "This is beautiful stuff," he says, looking ruefully at big boxes of just-picked Red Delicious next to his barn. "But I'm going to lose $50,000 to $60,000 on it.
11/wsj_1128:Besides rotten prices, he has been hit recently by hail, a bark-nibbling horde of mice, fungi and bugs.
11/wsj_1128:Even if a grower beats them back, his $2,000 rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors' orchards instead of pollinating his, Mr. Broderick says. 
11/wsj_1128:Though growers can't always keep the worm from the apple, they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying -- into the recently imported Gala, a sweet New Zealand native; the Esopus Spitzenburg, reportedly Thomas Jefferson's favorite apple; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty. "I've ripped out a lot of Delicious" and grafted the trees with many different shoots, says Steve Wood, a West Lebanon, N.H., grower, tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently. "I've got 70 kinds of apples.
11/wsj_1128:The Fuji is a product of meticulous Japanese pomological engineering, which fostered it 50 years ago at a government research orchard.
11/wsj_1128:Japanese researchers have bred dozens of strains of Fujis to hone its color, taste and shelf life.
11/wsj_1128:Now the best of them age as gracefully as Grannies, the industry's gold standard for storability.
11/wsj_1128:In the cornucopia of go-go apples, the Fuji's track record stands out: During the past 15 years, it has gone from almost zilch to some 50% of Japan's market. 
11/wsj_1128:"The Japanese apple market is very keyed to high quality," says David Lane, a scientist at a Canadian horticulture research center in Summerland, British Columbia, and so apples are more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity.
11/wsj_1128:The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that this year Americans will eat about 40% more fresh apples per capita than the Japanese. 
11/wsj_1128:Mr. Auvil, the Washington grower, says that he could sell Fujis to Taiwan buyers at $40 a box if he had them. (Taiwan already is a big importer of Fujis from other places, he adds.) But his first crop won't be picked till next year. "I expect to see the demand exceed supply for Fujis for the next 10 to 15 years," he adds.
11/wsj_1128:Mr. Auvil sees Fujis, in part, as striking a blow against the perversion of U.S. apples by supermarkets. "When the chain stores took over, there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer.
11/wsj_1128:Then, as growers bred them more for looks, and to satisfy supermarket chains' demands of long-term storage, the Red went into decline.
11/wsj_1129:Brush Wellman Inc. said its board increased the number of shares of common stock to be purchased under a previously authorized program to 3.9 million from 2.9 million. 
11/wsj_1129:The maker of engineered materials has acquired more than 2.7 million shares under the program. 
11/wsj_1130:The state attorney general's office filed suit against five New York brokerage firms, charging them with responsibility for much of a $200 million loss incurred by the state treasurer's office in 1987. 
11/wsj_1130:On Friday, the firms filed a suit against West Virginia in New York state court asking for a declaratory judgment absolving them of liability.
11/wsj_1130:In its suit, the attorney general's office alleges that brokers encouraged members of the treasurer's office to engage in high-volume, high-risk transactions that benefited the brokers. 
11/wsj_1131:From 1980 to 1988, while federal budget deficits totaled $1.41 trillion, the government issued $394 billion of new direct loans and an additional $756 billion of new primary loan guarantees.
11/wsj_1131:These figures omit secondary guarantees, deposit insurance, and the activities of Government-Sponsored Enterprises (a huge concern in its own right, as detailed on this page May 3). 
11/wsj_1131:Since the 1950s, federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume, subsidy rates, and policy applications, spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular.
11/wsj_1131:As we will see, many of these obligations don't show up as part of the federal deficit. 
11/wsj_1131:But recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control.
11/wsj_1131:Student loan defaults remain high at about 12%, and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement.
11/wsj_1131:GAO's findings are particularly troubling because the FHA has about $300 billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs. 
11/wsj_1131:Scores of other credit programs, subsidizing agriculture, small business, exporters, defense, energy, transportation and others, are less visible but in no better shape.
11/wsj_1131:If the programs continue their present path, the potential government losses are staggering: The federal government holds $222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $550 billion in primary guarantees. (Secondary guarantees of pools of FHA- and VA-backed loans by the agency known as Ginnie Mae currently exceed $330 billion.) 
11/wsj_1131:Although external events have contributed to the morass, the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs.
11/wsj_1131:Use credit to improve the operation of capital markets, not to provide subsidies. 
11/wsj_1131:There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program.
11/wsj_1131:In contrast, credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets.
11/wsj_1131:For example, legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector.
11/wsj_1131:Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds.
11/wsj_1131:High default rates, a low interest rate, and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high.
11/wsj_1131:In contrast, a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any student, regardless of family income, at market or near-market rates.
11/wsj_1131:Given the structure of most credit programs, it is surprising that default rates are not even higher.
11/wsj_1131:Since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts, the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low.
11/wsj_1131:Record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget. 
11/wsj_1131:Since the budget measures cash flow, a new $1 direct loan is treated as a $1 expenditure, even though at least part of the loan will be paid back.
11/wsj_1131:By converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee, the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit.
11/wsj_1131:The true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to government.
11/wsj_1131:Neither technique is perfect, but both are better than the current system, which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $20 billion annually, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
11/wsj_1131:A budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what Congress is committing them to. 
11/wsj_1131:Creative accounting is a hallmark of federal credit.
11/wsj_1131:More seriously, FmHA has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value.
11/wsj_1131:The administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices, including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits.
11/wsj_1131:Establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises, provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions, and reduce fraud. 
11/wsj_1131:Mr. Gale is an assistant professor of economics at UCLA. 
11/wsj_1132:Malcolm S. Todt was named vice president and senior officer in charge of equipment leasing to municipalities, a new effort of this bond insurer.
11/wsj_1132:Mr. Todt had been vice president and treasurer of Insilco Corp. 
11/wsj_1133:Mr. Bush has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that would explicitly give him a line-item veto, which would enable him to kill individual items in a big spending bill without having to kill the entire bill.
11/wsj_1134:Harris Ravine, executive vice president of customer satisfaction, was named executive vice president, finance and administration of this maker of data storage equipment.
11/wsj_1134:Mr. Ravine succeeds William R. Mansfield Jr., who will remain with the company until the end of the year to support the transition and to complete important projects. 
11/wsj_1135:The Bush administration said it is submitting a "comprehensive" proposal for overhauling agricultural trade that could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations. 
11/wsj_1135:The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products.
11/wsj_1135:Mr. Yeutter, seeking to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000, said the new U.S. proposal wouldn't "put farmers out of business" but would only encourage them to "grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants." 
11/wsj_1135:The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva, hoping that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990.
11/wsj_1135:Another U.S. proposal filed Monday urges more "fair play" in services trade, including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies. 
11/wsj_1135:For instance, the new U.S. package makes clear there would be a transition period during which GATT members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition.
11/wsj_1135:It also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports. 
11/wsj_1135:Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies, as the earlier U.S. proposal did, the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones.
11/wsj_1135:The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the European Community's current attempt to bar imports of beef from hormone-treated U.S. cattle.
11/wsj_1136:Earnings at the consumer-products giant were boosted by a gain of $125 million, or about 25 cents a share, stemming from last month's settlement of litigation with three of P&G's competitors over patents on P&G's Duncan Hines cookies. 
11/wsj_1136:Excluding the gain, P&G's earnings were close to analysts' predictions of about $1.40 a share for the quarter.
11/wsj_1136:Unit volume, or amount of products shipped, rose about 11% in the international segment, with P&G continuing to win market share in Japan's diaper and detergent markets.
11/wsj_1136:Last year's drought in the Midwest prompted retailers to stock up on oils ahead of anticipated price increases, boosting sales for Crisco and Puritan oils, analysts said. 
11/wsj_1136:Lynne Hyman, vice president of equity research for First Boston Corp., expects P&G to post net of about $4.20 a share, on a post-split basis. "But I'm recognizing there's a good chance they'll do a bit better than that," she says.
11/wsj_1136:One big factor affecting the fiscal second half will be the new stewardship of Edwin L. Artzt, who becomes chairman and chief executive officer in January.
11/wsj_1136:Because of his remarkable success turning around P&G's international operations, analysts have high hopes for his tenure. "If he does to the domestic operations what he did internationally," says Mr. Zurkuhlen, "this company will earn $6 or $7 a share in a few years." 
11/wsj_1137:The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to keep the promise of the Fifteenth Amendment and enable Southern blacks to go to the polls, unhindered by literacy tests and other exclusionary devices.
11/wsj_1137:Twenty-five years later, the Voting Rights Act has been transformed by the courts and the Justice Department into a program of racial gerrymandering designed to increase the number of blacks and other minorities -- Hispanics, Asians and native Americans -- holding elective office. 
11/wsj_1137:In the 1980s, the Justice Department and lower federal courts that enforce the Voting Rights Act have required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number of "safe" minority election districts -- districts where minorities form between 65% and 80% of the voting population.
11/wsj_1137:Although Section 2 of the act expressly disclaims requiring that minorities win a proportional share of elective offices, few municipal and state government plans achieve preclearance by the Justice Department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless they carve out as many solidly minority districts as possible. 
11/wsj_1137:The new goal of the Voting Rights Act -- more minorities in political office -- is laudable.
11/wsj_1137:For the political process to work, all citizens, regardless of race, must feel represented.
11/wsj_1137:One essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency.
11/wsj_1137:As is, blacks constitute 12% of the population, but fewer than 2% of elected leaders.
11/wsj_1137:Far from promoting a commonality of interests among black, white, Hispanic and other minority voters, drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter's and the candidate's most important trait.
11/wsj_1137:Such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person, and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one.
11/wsj_1137:Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities -- New York and Birmingham, Ala.
11/wsj_1137:In 1972, the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes, despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts. 
11/wsj_1137:This year, a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York's system of government completed a new charter, expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members.
11/wsj_1137:The Charter Revision Commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the Justice Department and the commission's own commitment to enhancing minority political leadership, the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of solidly minority districts.
11/wsj_1137:Blacks and Hispanics currently make up 38% of the city's population and hold only 25% of the seats on the council. 
11/wsj_1137:Several of the city's black leaders, including Democratic mayoral nominee David Dinkins, have spoken out for racial gerrymandering to accord blacks and Hispanics "the fullest opportunity for representation." 
11/wsj_1137:In this connection, it is important to note that several members of New York's sitting City Council represent heterogeneous districts that bring together sizable black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white populations -- Carolyn Maloney's 8th district in northern Manhattan and the south Bronx and Susan Alter's 25th district in Brooklyn, for example.
11/wsj_1137:Birmingham, Ala.: The unusual situation in Birmingham vividly illustrates the divisive consequences of carving out safe districts for racial minorities.
11/wsj_1137:Insisting that they are protected by the Voting Rights Act, a group of whites brought a federal suit in 1987 to demand that the city abandon at-large voting for the nine member City Council and create nine electoral districts, including four safe white districts.
11/wsj_1137:Richard Arrington, Birmingham's black mayor, lamented the consequences. "In the past, people who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they couldn't afford to offend blacks or whites," he said. "Now you go to districts, you're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme, white and black, on racial issues." Two hundred years ago, critics of the new United States Constitution warned that the electoral districts for Congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests.
11/wsj_1137:But James Madison refuted that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatises ever written, No. 10 of the Federalist Papers.
11/wsj_1137:Madison explained that a representative's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good.
11/wsj_1137:Large, heterogeneous election districts would encourage good government, said Madison, because a representative would be compelled to serve the interests of all his constituents and be servile to none. 
11/wsj_1137:Madison's noble and unifying vision of the representative still can guide us.
11/wsj_1137:As long as we believe that all Americans, of every race and ethnic background, have common interests and can live together cooperatively, our political map should reflect our belief.
11/wsj_1137:Ms. McCaughey is a constitutional scholar at the Center for the Study of the Presidency in New York. 
11/wsj_1138:Under {RICO}, the government may seek a temporary restraining order (TRO) upon the filing of a RICO indictment, in order to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered.
11/wsj_1138:Some highly publicized cases involving RICO TROs have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process.
11/wsj_1138:In order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected, the Criminal Division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of TROs in RICO prosecutions. (It should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements, such as review by the Asset Forfeiture Office.): 
11/wsj_1138:As part of the approval process for RICO prosecutions, the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture TRO for review by the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section.
11/wsj_1138:The prosecutor must show that less-intrusive remedies (such as bonds) are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction. 
11/wsj_1138:In seeking approval of a TRO, the prosecutor must articulate any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the TRO would have on innocent third parties, balanced against the government's need to preserve the assets. 
11/wsj_1138:In deciding whether forfeiture (and, hence, a TRO) is appropriate, the Section will consider the nature and severity of the offense; the government's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime. 
11/wsj_1138:When a RICO TRO is being sought, the prosecutor is required, at the earliest appropriate time, to state publicly that the government's request for a TRO, and eventual forfeiture, is made in full recognition of the rights of third parties -- that is, in requesting the TRO, the government will not seek to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of the defendant; will not seek through use of the relation-back doctrine to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them; will not seek to vitiate legitimate business transactions occurring between the defendant and third parties; and will, in all other respects, assist the court in ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected, through proceeding under {RICO} and otherwise. 
11/wsj_1139:Sales of North American-built cars and trucks plunged 20.5% in mid-October from a year earlier, as domestic manufacturers paid the price for heavy incentives earlier this year. 
11/wsj_1139:"People are waiting for {new} factory giveaways," said Ben Kaye, sales manager of Bob Brest Auto World in Lynn, Mass., whose sales are slow. 
11/wsj_1139:GM also had dismal results in the first 10 days of the month, while other auto makers reported mixed results. 
11/wsj_1139:All of the Big Three suffered in the just-ended period, however, with sales of all domestically made cars, including those built at Japanese-managed plants, falling 19% to 158,863 from a year earlier.
11/wsj_1139:The seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles, a small improvement from the 5.8 million rate of early October, but a big drop from the 7.1 million rate a year ago. 
11/wsj_1139:Sales of domestically made trucks also continued to be sluggish in mid-October, dropping 22.8% to 94,543 from a year ago. 
11/wsj_1139:Industry analyst John H. Qualls, a vice president with Hill & Knowlton in St. Louis, forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a 93-day supply of cars at the end of the year, even if car sales improve to a 6.5 million vehicle rate for the quarter.
11/wsj_1139:Ford Motor Co. reported a 21.2% drop in sales of domestic-made cars to 46,995 and a 24.2% drop in domestic trucks to 31,143.
11/wsj_1139:The sales are being dragged down by a glut of 1989 vehicles, said Joel Pitcoff, a Ford analyst.
11/wsj_1139:The earlier use of incentives depleted the market of "scavengers" for bargain-basement 1989 cars, he said. 
11/wsj_1139:Honda Motor Co., which continues to have short supplies of domestically made Accords, saw its sales of North American-built cars fall 14.1% to 8,355.
11/wsj_1139:But sales of domestic cars and trucks at Nissan Motor Corp. rose 26.1% to 5,651.
11/wsj_1139:A Nissan spokesman attributed the increase to the use of incentives this year and not a year ago and to higher fleet sales.
11/wsj_1140:Short interest in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks rose 6% as of mid-October, its biggest jump since 6.3% last April. 
11/wsj_1140:However, the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the National Association of Securities Dealers include only those trades completed, or settled, by Oct. 13, rather than trades that occurred on that day, according to Gene Finn, chief economist for the NASD. Generally, it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade. 
11/wsj_1140:The total short interest in Nasdaq stocks as of mid-October was 237.1 million shares, up from 223.7 million in September but well below the record level of 279 million shares established in July 1987.
11/wsj_1140:Short interest, which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold, but not yet replaced, can be a bad-expectations barometer for many stocks. 
11/wsj_1140:Among 2,412 of the largest OTC issues, short interest rose to 196.8 million shares, from 185.7 million in 2,379 stocks in September.
11/wsj_1140:Big stocks with large short interest gains as of Oct. 13 included First Executive, Intel, Campeau and LIN Broadcasting. 
11/wsj_1140:Meritor Savings again had the dubious honor of being the OTC stock with the biggest short interest position on Nasdaq.
11/wsj_1140:First Executive and troubled Valley National Corp. of Arizona were next in line. 
11/wsj_1140:For example, an investor may seek to profit during some takeover situations by buying stock in one company involved and shorting the stock of the other. 
11/wsj_1140:Short interest in the American depositary receipts of Jaguar, the target of both Ford Motor and General Motors, more than doubled. 
11/wsj_1140:Nasdaq stocks that showed a drop in short interest included Adobe Systems, Class A shares of Tele-Communications and takeover targets Lyphomed and Jerrico. 
11/wsj_1140:The NASD, which operates the Nasdaq computer system on which 5,200 OTC issues trade, compiles short interest data in two categories: the approximately two-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that trade on the National Market System; and the one-third, and generally smaller, Nasdaq stocks that aren't a part of the system. 
11/wsj_1140:The October short interest represents 1.04 days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period, compared with 0.94 day a month ago. 
11/wsj_1140:Among bigger OTC stocks, the figures represent 2.05 days of average daily volume, compared with 2.14 days in September. 
11/wsj_1140:The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of Oct. 13 or in which there was a short position change of at least 25,000 shares since Sept. 15 (see accompanying tables -- WSJ Oct. 25, 1989). 
11/wsj_1141:From the Sept. 30-Oct. 4 issue of The Economist: 
11/wsj_1141:What defeated General Aoun was not only the weight of the Syrian army.
11/wsj_1141:The weight of Lebanon's history was also against him; and it is a history Israel is in danger of repeating. 
11/wsj_1141:Its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the Palestinians.
11/wsj_1141:By not choosing one of these options, Israelis will condemn themselves, as the Maronites did, to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst, and so to the internal erosion of their state.
11/wsj_1141:Unlike the Maronites, Israel's Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies; Jerusalem will become Belfast before it becomes Beirut.
11/wsj_1141:But that is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of General Aoun. 
11/wsj_1142:The effects on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market makers, who watched the Nasdaq Composite Index tumble in sympathy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally. 
11/wsj_1142:Microsoft, battered by profit taking in recent sessions, sank as much as 4; but it finished at 80 7/8, down 2 1/4 on volume of one million shares. 
11/wsj_1142:"The market started with several strikes against it," said Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of UAL Corp. continued to unravel, and reports that the junk-bond market is disintegrating. 
11/wsj_1142:While Shearson doesn't do computer-guided program trading for its own account, the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes, Mr. DaPuzzo acknowledged. 
11/wsj_1142:Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur.
11/wsj_1142:Groused Robert Antolini, head of over-the-counter trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette: "It's making it tough for traders to make money." He said that when sell programs kick in, many traders believe that "there's no sense in sticking your nose out because you're an instant loser." 
11/wsj_1142:Lodestar Group said it will make a $6-a-share offer for the remaining Kinder-Care Learning Center common stock if it acquires a majority of the company's shares in a pending rights offering by Kinder-Care Learning Center's parent, Kinder-Care Inc. Shares of KinderCare Inc. closed at 3 1/2, also up 1/4, on volume of 700,000. 
11/wsj_1142:The company posted third-quarter earnings of 95 cents a share, down from $1.26 a year earlier.
11/wsj_1142:LIN Broadcasting slid 1 3/8 to 108 3/4, despite reporting third-quarter net of 46 cents a share, up from 39 cents the previous year.
11/wsj_1143:Probably the most clear-cut Soviet violation, for example, is the Krasnoyarsk radar. -- "Arms Control Reality," Nov. 20, 1984, the first of some 20 Journal editorials saying that Krasnoyarsk violated the ABM treaty. 
11/wsj_1143:-- "Whether the installation is for early warning or space track, it clearly is not deployed," the lawmakers said. "Thus we judge it to be not a violation of the ABM treaty at this time." The delegation included a reporter from the New York Times, aides to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Rep. Les AuCoin, and Natural Resources Defense Council staff members. -- The Washington Post, Sept. 9, 1987. 
11/wsj_1143:-- The U.S.S.R. has taken unprecedented unilateral measures of openness, by giving American representatives a possibility to inspect the building site of the Krasnoyarsk radar as well as radar vans in the areas of Gomel and Moscow, so as to see for themselves that there are no violations of the ABM treaty of 1972 on the part of the Soviet Union. -- Letter from Eduard Shevardnadze to U.N. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar, reported in Tass, June 10, 1988. 
11/wsj_1143:-- The construction of this station equal in size to the Egyptian pyramids constituted, I say it directly, a clear violation of ABM. -- Eduard Shevardnadze, Oct. 23, 1989. 
11/wsj_1143:We're happy, we guess, to receive confirmation of the Krasnoyarsk violation from the Soviets, five years after we started writing about it.
11/wsj_1143:Without question, something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the Politburo.
11/wsj_1143:Our own test of "glasnost's" authenticity would be a Soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling mysteries in U.S.-Soviet relations -- the reported 1979 anthrax outbreak at a Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk. 
11/wsj_1143:The U.S. government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there, and hence a violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.
11/wsj_1143:It also was detailed in Congressional testimony this past February: An explosion at the Microbiology and Virology Institute in Sverdlovsk released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths. 
11/wsj_1143:And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited Krasnoyarsk, we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted-meat theory by a U.S. team of scientists who met with Soviet counterparts in Washington last year. 
11/wsj_1143:The Soviets' explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal feed made from the bones of cattle that grazed on soil that was naturally infected with anthrax spores.
11/wsj_1143:Harvard's Matthew Meselson -- who we read has sold something called the "scientific community" on the notion that "yellow rain" attacks on the Laotian Hmong were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant bees -- found the Soviet anthrax scenario "completely plausible." 
11/wsj_1143:And we certainly do not believe that Mr. Gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it.
11/wsj_1143:Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself. 
11/wsj_1143:But the stated U.S. position is detailed and specific, and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling. 
11/wsj_1143:Until that happens, glasnost cannot begin to deserve the kind of credibility Mr. Shevardnadze was bidding for with his confessions on Monday. 
11/wsj_1144:Manville Corp. said it offered to buy $500 million of its convertible preferred stock from the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust in a move that would improve the trust's liquidity and reduce the potential number of Manville shares outstanding. 
11/wsj_1144:Manville said it made the offer within the past several weeks as part of an effort to improve shareholder value.
11/wsj_1144:The trust, created as part of Manville's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases, owns 7.2 million of the Series A convertible preferred shares, which are each convertible into 10 Manville common shares.
11/wsj_1144:The trust also owns half of Manville's 48 million common shares outstanding. 
11/wsj_1144:Based on Manville's closing price yesterday of $9.25 a share, Manville's offer would purchase about 5.4 million of its preferred shares, or about 75% of the trust's preferred stock holding. 
11/wsj_1144:In addition to the stock and 20% of Manville's profits beginning in 1992, the trust is supposed to receive $2.5 billion over its 27-year life.
11/wsj_1144:As of June 30, it had settled about 15,000 of 81,000 claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled $136 million, a large portion of its $268 million in cash and marketable securities.
11/wsj_1144:Since most of its assets are tied to Manville, a forest and building products concern, the trust might also want to diversify its holdings. 
11/wsj_1144:As part of its offer, Manville said it requested changes in some covenants between it and the trust to allow Manville to "reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure." A Manville spokesman wouldn't elaborate on the proposed changes.
11/wsj_1144:Manville said the shares issued to the trust were intended to be sold, as needed, and that Manville has the right of first refusal to buy those shares. 
11/wsj_1145:Northeast Utilities raised its bid for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, which is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection, to $2.25 billion from $1.85 billion. 
11/wsj_1145:Northeast's raised bid, which was supported by PS of New Hampshire's official shareholder committee, is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company, the largest utility in New Hampshire. 
11/wsj_1145:Some of the three other bidding groups are expected to increase their offers tomorrow, a date set for revised offers by a bankruptcy court judge.
11/wsj_1145:Secured creditors would recover both principal and interest, while unsecured creditors would receive only principal and interest accrued before PS of New Hampshire filed for Bankruptcy Code protection in January 
11/wsj_1145:Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant, which is completed but isn't yet operating, equity holders would receive up to $500 million in cash, preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds.
11/wsj_1145:In addition, Northeast promised the State of New Hampshire that rate increases would be limited to 5.5% annually for seven years.
11/wsj_1145:Wilbur Ross, financial adviser to the equity holders said, "Given the state's strong bargaining position . . . we believe the NU plan provides the best recovery available" to PS of New Hampshire's equity holders. 
11/wsj_1145:Officials of PS of New Hampshire couldn't be reached for comment.
11/wsj_1145:New England Electric System, Westborough, Mass., has proposed buying the company for $2 billion as part of a plan that would require rate increases of only 4.8% annually for seven years.
11/wsj_1145:The state of New Hampshire has favored that plan. 
11/wsj_1145:The other bidder is United Illuminating Co., New Haven, Conn., with a bid valued at $2.2 billion and and a proposal for seven years of 5.5% rate increases. 
11/wsj_1146:Tons of delectably rotting potatoes, barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land as thousands of farmers turn the state's buyers away.
11/wsj_1146:The cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one.
11/wsj_1146:At dawn on a cool day, hundreds travel to the private market in Radzymin, a town not far from Warsaw, hauling pigs, cattle and sacks of feed that the state's official buyers can't induce them to sell.
11/wsj_1146:In a crush of trucks and horse carts on the trodden field, Andrzej Latowski wrestles a screeching, overweight hog into the trunk of a private butcher's Polish Fiat. "Of course it's better to sell private," he says, as the butcher trundles away. "Why should anybody want to sell to them?" 
11/wsj_1146:He won't for long, because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up. "There's no feed," he says. "You can't buy anything nowadays.
11/wsj_1146:His truck is parked across the field, in a row of grain sellers.
11/wsj_1146:Made in U.S.S.R." The farmer at the next truck shouts, "Wheat! It's nice! It won't be cheaper! We sell direct!" A heavy, kerchiefed woman runs a handful through her fingers, and counts him out a pile of zlotys. 
11/wsj_1146:"Country people breed pigs," says Mr. Chojnowski, leaning against the back of his truck. "They can't buy feed from the state.
11/wsj_1146:At closing time, farmers cart out most of what they carted in.
11/wsj_1146:The hulk of Stalinism, it seems, will not quickly crumble away.
11/wsj_1146:Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement, processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors, pesticides, fertilizers and feed. 
11/wsj_1146:Building them now will require undergirding from the West, and removal of political deadwood, a job that Solidarity has barely started.
11/wsj_1146:"We are dealing with real entrepreneurs," says Antoni Leopold, an economist who advises Rural Solidarity, the union's countryside offshoot. "There are a lot of them, and they have property." 
11/wsj_1146:Polish peasants, spurning the collectivizers, were once a source of shame to orthodox Communists.
11/wsj_1146:Now, among Communist reformers, they are objects of envy.
11/wsj_1146:Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76% of its arable land.
11/wsj_1146:On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes.
11/wsj_1146:Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation.
11/wsj_1146:A few miles past Radzymin, a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into Zalubice, a village of tumbledown farms.
11/wsj_1146:No gas. "We wanted them to build a road here," he says. "They started, and then abandoned it." A tractor, his only mechanized equipment, stands in front of the pigsty. "It's Russian.
11/wsj_1146:Even if I had a lot of money, I couldn't buy what I need." 
11/wsj_1146:In Poland, only 4% of all investment goes toward making things farmers want; in the West, it is closer to 20%.
11/wsj_1146:Yet their best boast is that they produce 32% of Polish pork. 
11/wsj_1146:There is a lot of waste.
11/wsj_1146:His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain.
11/wsj_1146:He is free to invest in chickens, and to fail for lack of chicken wire.
11/wsj_1146:He has plenty of freedom -- but no choices. 
11/wsj_1146:Villages like Zalubice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors.
11/wsj_1146:Some men stay, their best friend a bottle of vodka, but two million acres have gone fallow.
11/wsj_1146:The potential is displayed along every road into Warsaw: row upon row of greenhouses, stretching out behind modern mansions that trumpet their owners' wealth.
11/wsj_1146:Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland, the pickles and sauerkraut sublime, the state monopolies long broken.
11/wsj_1146:Maria Stolzman, one of its farm experts, lays it on the line: "The World Bank will be brought in to help us destroy the old system." 
11/wsj_1146:But until then, and probably long afterward, the Communists' apparat of obstruction -- from the head of the dairy co-op to the village bank manager -- will stay planted in the Polish countryside. 
11/wsj_1146:"We know how to get from capitalism to socialism," Sergiusz Niciporuk is saying one afternoon. "We don't know how to get from socialism to capitalism." He farms 12 acres in Grabowiec, two miles from the Soviet border in one of Poland's poorest places.
11/wsj_1146:Now he is mounting the steps of a stucco building in a nearby village, on a visit to the Communist administrator, the "naczelnik." 
11/wsj_1146:"Solidarity doesn't care for the good of this region," he says after a few pleasantries. "They want to turn everything upside down in a week.
11/wsj_1147:By a lopsided 401-18 margin, the chamber rejected an effort to waive Gramm-Rudman for purposes of addressing the two disasters, and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $1.44 billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by Congress. 
11/wsj_1147:The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991, and the issue forced a confrontation between the Appropriations Committee leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, whose California district was at the center of the earthquake last week.
11/wsj_1147:Going to the well of the chamber, Mr. Panetta demanded the costs be fully counted.
11/wsj_1147:His prominent role put him in the awkward position of challenging the very committee members on whom his state will be most dependent in the months ahead. 
11/wsj_1147:Because of the vagaries of Gramm-Rudman, the immediate impact is relatively small.
11/wsj_1147:Within the appropriations process, the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget. 
11/wsj_1147:The underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight, and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and, critics say, mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance.
11/wsj_1147:Also, the high price of San Francisco real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average.
11/wsj_1147:But all funding is cut for the Philippines, and projects in South Korea are cut to $13.6 million, or less than a sixth of the administration's request. 
11/wsj_1147:An estimated $38.9 million was set aside for military installations in the home state of North Carolina Rep. W.G. Hefner, the House chairman.
11/wsj_1147:Texas and California are traditionally powerful within the conference, but equally striking is the dominance of Alaska, Pennsylvania and West Virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process.
11/wsj_1147:No individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii), who chairs the Senate defense subcommittee.
11/wsj_1147:But it gave ground to Mr. Inouye on a number of projects, ranging from a $11 million parking garage here, to a land transfer in Hawaii, to a provision to assist the Makwah Indian Tribe in Washington state.
11/wsj_1147:The tribe is one of the poorest in the Pacific Northwest. 
11/wsj_1147:Mr. Inouye, who chairs the select committee on Indian Affairs, used his power to move $400,000 from the Air Force to the Bureau of Indian Affairs to assist in renovating a decommissoned base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. 
11/wsj_1148:Mobil Corp. is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the U.S., possibly as soon as next month, say individuals familiar with the company's strategy. 
11/wsj_1148:The size of the cuts isn't known, but they'll be centered in the exploration and production division, which is responsible for locating oil reserves, drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas. 
11/wsj_1148:This would be a second round of cuts by Mobil, which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by 15% to 20% during the mid-1980s as part of an industrywide shakeout.
11/wsj_1148:Mobil's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil-producing operations. 
11/wsj_1148:The report says that "the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our U.S. operations." 
11/wsj_1148:A company spokesman, reached at his home last night, would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week. 
11/wsj_1148:Most oil companies, including Mobil, have been reporting lower third-quarter earnings, largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses. 
11/wsj_1148:Individuals familiar with Mobil's strategy say that Mobil is reducing its U.S. work force because of declining U.S. output.
11/wsj_1148:Industrywide, oil production in this country fell by 500,000 barrels a day to 7.7 million barrels in the first eight months of this year.
11/wsj_1148:One Mobil executive said that the $40 million charge related to the action indicates "a substantial" number of people will be involved.
11/wsj_1149:The Justice Department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal Judge David Sentelle recently called a "monster." Needless to say, he was talking about RICO.
11/wsj_1149:The text of the "new policy" guidelines from the Criminal Division are reprinted nearby.
11/wsj_1149:They strongly suggest that Justice's prosecutions of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Michael Milken and Princeton/Newport violated notions of fundamental fairness.
11/wsj_1149:Justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics.
11/wsj_1149:This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who was more inclined to gathering scalps than understanding markets. 
11/wsj_1149:The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors, clients, bankers and others.
11/wsj_1149:The forfeiture memo cited "considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process." It told prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are "less intrusive" alternatives, such as bonds, and in any case not to seek forfeitures "disproportionate to the defendant's crime." 
11/wsj_1149:Prosecutors wanted $23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $400,000. 
11/wsj_1149:The experience of Princeton/Newport and initiation of other RICO-forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank.
11/wsj_1149:Drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges "which the company is not in a position to dispute" because of RICO. Part of Drexel's plea was to cut Mr. Milken loose.
11/wsj_1149:Judge Sentelle, of the appeals court in Washington, made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled, "RICO: The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence." He said ours is supposed to be "a government of laws not of men," and yet RICO defenders "tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO." No prosecutorial guidelines, observed or unobserved, limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages. 
11/wsj_1149:We suspect that Justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of RICO can guarantee an end to injustices in its name. 
11/wsj_1150:"The Famous Teddy Z," which CBS Inc. had hoped would emerge as one of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime-time schedule, isn't turning out to be the hit the network envisaged. 
11/wsj_1150:In figures released yesterday by A.C. Nielsen Co. "Teddy Z," produced by the television unit of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., was in 37th place.
11/wsj_1150:"There is strong indication that `Teddy Z' is not compatible with the shows it is surrounding," said John Sisk, senior vice president at J. Walter Thompson Co., a unit of WPP Group PLC. 
11/wsj_1150:Last week, "Murphy Brown" was viewed by 14.1% of the available television households, while the number dropped to 12.6% for "Teddy Z" and rose to 14.2% for "Designing Women." 
11/wsj_1150:Instead, CBS hopes the show will increasingly highlight the talent agency and the business of being an agent. 
11/wsj_1151:Prices of long-term Treasury bonds moved inversely to the stock market as investors sought safety amid growing evidence the economy is weakening.
11/wsj_1151:As the stock market recovered some of its losses later in the day, bond prices retreated.
11/wsj_1151:But analysts said the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly durable-goods orders and lackluster mid-October auto sales helped prop up the Treasury market.
11/wsj_1151:A slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices. 
11/wsj_1151:But orders for non-defense capital goods, a precursor of future plant and equipment spending, were off 5.6% after falling 10.3% in August. 
11/wsj_1151:Auto makers reported that mid-October sales were running at an annual rate of about 5.8 million units, far less than the 6.6 million units analysts had expected.
11/wsj_1151:But as stock prices recovered some of the early losses, so did the U.S. currency.
11/wsj_1151:Although dealers said investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market's recent troubles and as the U.S. economy weakens, the dollar ended down only modestly. 
11/wsj_1152:"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" may be visiting some new venues in the near future.
11/wsj_1152:Judge Robert ("Maximum Bob") Potter sentenced Jim Bakker to 45 years in the big house yesterday, while a Beverly Hills judge tucked away Zsa Zsa Gabor for three days, plus 120 hours of work with homeless women.
11/wsj_1152:Miss Gabor recanted her earlier-expressed fear of jailhouse lesbians.
11/wsj_1152:Mr. Bakker said he was guilty of sin but not fraud.
11/wsj_1153:Boeing Co. said Trans European Airways ordered a dozen 737 jetliners valued at a total of about $450 million.
11/wsj_1153:The 300 and 400 series aircraft will be powered by engines jointly produced by General Electric Co. and Snecma of France. 
11/wsj_1153:Currently, Boeing has a backlog of about $80 billion, but production has been slowed by a strike of 55,000 machinists, which entered its 22nd day today. 
11/wsj_1153:Last week, a mediator failed to rekindle talks between the company and the strikers, who have rejected a pay raise offer of 10% over three years. 
11/wsj_1154:When the good fairy assigned to Slovakia hovered over the cradle of Edita Gruberova many years ago in Bratislava, she sprinkled her with high E flats, sparkling Ds, clean trills, and coloratura ornaments silvery as magic dust.
11/wsj_1154:Maybe she could drop by at the Metropolitan Opera and bring along what she forgot, a little charm, a few smidgins of thespian skills and a nice wig. 
11/wsj_1154:Cast as Violetta Valery in a new production of Verdi's "La Traviata," Ms. Gruberova last week did many things nicely and others not so well.
11/wsj_1154:Just when Ms. Gruberova sat down away from her guests to cough in private, her salon began sliding around the stage; her country hideaway also has a very active set of drapes.
11/wsj_1154:Large and lavish, "Traviata" is another addition to the Met's growing stock of cast-proof productions mostly by Mr. Zeffirelli.
11/wsj_1154:They have a life of their own and can be counted on to look good and perform whenever a cast isn't up to either.
11/wsj_1154:If a strike ever hits the Met, the company can still sell tickets to his "Boheme" and "Turandot" and boom out recordings (of another era).
11/wsj_1154:Or is it that Mr. Z. is getting a little tired of "Traviata"?
11/wsj_1154:Of heart-pounding moments there were nearly none, and whether this has to do with Mr. Kleiber or the wooden cast is hard to say.
11/wsj_1154:In any event, Ms. Gruberova barely ventilated Violetta's anguish in her long meeting with Wolfgang Brendel, who as Germont seemed fairly desperate trying to inject an Italianate lilt into his heavy, teutonic baritone. "Di Provenza" wasn't much of an advertisement for sunny, southern France.
11/wsj_1154:Perhaps Mr. Kleiber could let him substitute one of the songs about dead children and dark nights from Mahler's "Kindertotenlieder." 
11/wsj_1154:Speaking of dark nights, the Met's next-door neighbor, the New York City Opera, has canceled its season after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians, who wanted pay parity with the the Chicago Lyric and San Francisco Opera orchestras.
11/wsj_1154:The cancellation bodes poorly for a company already beset with an identity crisis exacerbated by the retirement of general director Beverly Sills and the amazing appointment of Christopher Keene as her successor after his years of feckless toiling in the pit.
11/wsj_1154:Each of them contributed a section at the behest of Verdi, who was nearly driven to his own early grave by the troublesome arrangements.
11/wsj_1154:We know Verdi's own contribution was mighty impressive since the operatic "Libera me" was reworked for the Manzoni Requiem, of which he wrote every note himself having learned his lesson.
11/wsj_1154:The surprising discovery of the evening at Fisher was the high standard achieved by some of his now-obscure colleagues, notably Raimondo Boucheron.
11/wsj_1154:Maybe she could step across the plaza to the Met -- where she has still to make her debut -- and help out her Czech compatriot by singing the slow parts of "Traviata." 
11/wsj_1154:The Tokyo International Film Festival was no match for the Cannes Film Festival in terms of prestige, but it made its mark: It awarded the largest cash prize of any film festival to young and first-time film makers. 
11/wsj_1154:At this year's event, the third since the festival got under way in 1985, Idrissa Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso won the Sakura Gold prize of $143,000 for "Yaaba" ("Old Woman").
11/wsj_1154:By comparison, Cannes now gives $39,000 to the winner of its young director's award. 
11/wsj_1154:Says director George Miller ("Mad Max"): "I think the Tokyo festival may become known as a major attraction for young directors because of the money as well as the recognition." 
11/wsj_1154:Vincent Tolentino, a correspondent for the French magazine Telerama, says of the recently ended Tokyo festival: "No one makes deals . . . and most of the films have been seen before at other festivals." 
11/wsj_1154:Belgium decided that investors who demand the delivery of their securities when they buy shares or domestic bonds will have to pay an additional 100 Belgian francs (about $2.60) for each transaction, bringing the total fee to 200 francs.
11/wsj_1154:The law could redound to the advantage of brokers and banks, who incur high administrative costs to deliver securities to investors. 
11/wsj_1154:Japan is considering giving aid to Hungary and Poland to support their recent political reforms, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said. "This is the first time, if we decide to do so, for Japan to extend aid of this kind to Eastern European countries," the spokesman said.
11/wsj_1154:He said Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also is studying the possibility of a visit to the two Eastern bloc nations and to Western Europe next January. 
11/wsj_1154:Drugs were a major issue in two days of talks between French President Francois Mitterrand and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. "I demand the utmost severity in the fight against drug traffickers," President Mitterrand said after the meeting in Valladolid, Spain.
11/wsj_1154:He added: "Banks must open their books." The leaders' talks coincided with a meeting in Madrid of anti-drug experts from the U.S., France, Italy, Spain, Peru, Bolivia and Colombia.
11/wsj_1154:Three Soviet government officials -- the ministers of railroads, of foreign economic relations and of heavy-machine building -- will visit Tehran next month for talks, Iran's official news agency reported.
11/wsj_1154:Under an agreement signed last June, the Soviets will help Iran in oil exploration and other areas in return for exports of Iranian natural gas.
11/wsj_1154:And in Paris, Mahmoud Vaezi, Iran's vice minister of foreign affairs, began a five-day visit to discuss such matters as compensation to French enterprises for contracts broken by the Khomeini regime. 
11/wsj_1154:Mr. Castaneda's office will reportedly issue warrants during the next six months for the arrest of another 10,000 federal employees.
11/wsj_1154:Those employees are suspected of illegally gaining an estimated $376.8 million, the prosecutor was quoted as saying by the Excelsior news service.
11/wsj_1154:"The rest will probably not be recoverable either because the statute of limitations expired or because many prefer to spend additional time in jail rather than return the money," the prosecutor said. 
11/wsj_1154:The United Nations, which is distributing farm tools to returning refugees in Namibia, is rethinking a plan to hand out machetes because of the tense political climate during preparations for independence from South Africa. "The decision to distribute machetes at this time, which could be used as weapons, is under review," said a U.N. spokesman. . . . Sources close to the family of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said she is expecting a second child, probably early next year. 
11/wsj_1155:In what has become a series of bad-news announcements, the world's largest maker of supercomputers said that after reviewing its order prospects, "we have concluded it is prudent to plan for next year on the assumption that revenue again will be flat." 
11/wsj_1155:Marcello Gumucio, president, said the company "did well in the quarter as far as revenues and earnings are concerned, and not quite as well in terms of signing orders." 
11/wsj_1155:As for the current period, Mr. Gumucio said, "We anticipate that fourth-quarter revenue and earnings will be substantially greater than any of the preceding three quarters, but not up to the record levels of last year's fourth quarter" when Cray earned $88.5 million, or $2.80 a share. 
11/wsj_1155:He added that the company expects "strong" operating profit for the year, "but at a level significantly lower than last year." He said 1989's net income could be 11% to 13% of revenue, which, assuming current expectations, would be 40% to 45% below 1988's level.
11/wsj_1155:Last year, Cray earned $156.6 million, or $4.99 a share, on revenue of $756.3 million. 
11/wsj_1155:Next year "looks dismal," said analyst Paul Luber of Robert Baird & Co., Milwaukee.
11/wsj_1155:Noting that Cray doesn't have a low-end supercomputer to compete with the likes of Convex Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., Mr. Luber said such a machine would be necessary "to get things back on line here." Cray has indicated it will decide on whether to build such a machine before year end. 
11/wsj_1156:Net for the New Brunswick, N.J., maker of health-care products climbed to $265 million, or 80 cents a share, from $240 million, or 71 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
11/wsj_1156:In a statement, Ralph S. Larsen, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company was pleased with its third-quarter sales performance, "especially in light of the extremely competitive environment in domestic consumer markets and the negative impact of unfavorable exchange rates this quarter." 
11/wsj_1156:The company cited softness in the retail health and beauty aids category, "as well as the intense competition in the company's sanitary protection product line." Overseas sales were stronger, principally because of a rebound in Brazil, where economic turmoil had hurt year-earlier results, Johnson & Johnson said. 
11/wsj_1156:Mr. Lothson of PaineWebber said the company's sales pace has been picking up largely because the effect of unfavorable exchange rates has been easing -- a pattern continuing this quarter.
11/wsj_1156:Bergen Brunswig Corp., proposed offering of liquid yield option notes, via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 
11/wsj_1156:Columbia Gas System Inc., shelf offering of up to $200 million of debentures. 
11/wsj_1156:Laserscope, initial offering of 1,656,870 common shares, of which 1,455,000 shares are to be sold by the company and 201,870 by holders, via Alex.
11/wsj_1156:TeleVideo Systems Inc., proposed offering of 1,853,735 common shares, to be sold by holders. 
11/wsj_1156:Western Gas System Inc., initial offering of 3,250,000 common shares, of which 3,040,000 shares will be sold by the company and 210,000 by a holder, via Prudential-Bache Capital Funding, Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. and Hanifen, Imhoff Inc. 
11/wsj_1157:Four of those insiders sold more than half their holdings. 
11/wsj_1157:Much of the recent slide in Dun & Bradstreet's stock came late last week, after negative comments by analysts at Merrill Lynch & Co. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. 
11/wsj_1157:One of Dun & Bradstreet's chief businesses is compiling reports that rate the credit-worthiness of millions of American companies.
11/wsj_1157:Among the insider sales, Charles Raikes, the firm's general counsel, sold 12,281 shares in August, representing 46% of his holdings in the company.
11/wsj_1157:The shares represented 66% of his Dun & Bradstreet holdings, according to the company. 
11/wsj_1157:The other insiders, all senior or executive vice presidents, sold between 2,520 and 6,881 shares, representing between 8% and 70% of their holdings, according to SEC filings. 
11/wsj_1157:But analysts focused more on the drop in revenue, to $1.04 billion from $1.07 billion, reflecting in part a continuing drop in sales of the controversial credit-reporting services. 
11/wsj_1157:Insider selling is not unusual at Dun & Bradstreet; in fact, the recent pace of selling is just about average for the company, according to figures compiled by Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., firm that specializes in tracking and analyzing SEC insider filings. 
11/wsj_1157:But previous sales have often been sales of shares purchased through the exercise of stock options and sold six months later, as soon as allowed, said Robert Gabele, president of Invest/Net.
11/wsj_1157:TASTY PROFITS: Michael A. Miles, chief executive officer of Philip Morris Cos. ' Kraft General Foods unit, bought 6,000 shares of the company on Sept. 22 for $157 each.
11/wsj_1157:Mr. Miles's newly purchased shares are now worth $1,068,000, based on Philip Morris's closing price of $44.50, up 62.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. 
11/wsj_1157:SHEDDING GLITTER: Two directors of Pegasus Gold Inc., a Spokane, Wash., precious-metals mining firm, sold most of their holdings in the company Aug. 31.
11/wsj_1157:John J. Crabb sold 4,500 shares for $11.13 each, leaving himself with a stake of 500 shares.
11/wsj_1157:Peter Kutney sold 5,000 shares, all of his holdings, for $11.38 a share, or $56,900. 
11/wsj_1157:On Wall Street, Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Daniel A. Roling rates the stock "neutral" and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. lists it as a "buy." Pegasus Gold "has been on a lot of recommended lists as a junior growth company stepping into the big leagues," says Marty McNeill, metals analyst at Dominick & Dominick, a New York investment firm. "It's a good company, and growing; there's nothing that would warrant that it be sold." 
11/wsj_1158:Medieval philosophers used to hold the sensible belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist, and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all.
11/wsj_1158:Now, only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity; it is built into His nature.
11/wsj_1158:But since the time of Darwin, we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species.
11/wsj_1158:Aren't we, after all, the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution?
11/wsj_1158:If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life, then it was only a matter of eons before splendid beings endowed with reason, self-awareness and taste shimmered onto the scene. 
11/wsj_1158:Star lecturer at Harvard, author of numerous popular books on science, and scourge of the creationist lobby, Mr. Gould is perhaps the world's most eminent evolutionary theorist.
11/wsj_1158:For him, natural history is anything but a gradual, predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness; it is a careening, chaotic affair in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a one-in-a-million shot. 
11/wsj_1158:In "Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History" (Norton, 326 pages, $19.95), Mr. Gould makes his case for "the awesome improbability of human evolution." The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called the Burgess Shale.
11/wsj_1158:Here, in an area smaller than a city block, lay buried traces of countless weird creatures that had frolicked more than 500 million years ago -- creatures whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world's oceans today. 
11/wsj_1158:Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who discovered the Burgess Shale, one Charles Doolittle Walcott.
11/wsj_1158:The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design, limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species.
11/wsj_1158:Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale.
11/wsj_1158:By making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three-dimensional structures, this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet.
11/wsj_1158:Would that Mr. Gould's minute descriptions of these creatures was always so colorful.
11/wsj_1158:A good deal of the book is boring, particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text.
11/wsj_1158:Interest picks up, though, when Mr. Gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution.
11/wsj_1158:Not long after the appearance of life, evidently, there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth.
11/wsj_1158:The vast majority of them, however, were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate.
11/wsj_1158:Consequently, the winnowing process was like a lottery "in which each group {held} a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues." So much for survival of the fittest. 
11/wsj_1158:Back when the Burgess fauna were flourishing, it seems, human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called Pikaia.
11/wsj_1158:Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating; like an existentialist of old, he views our contingency as "a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility." I, by contrast, cannot help feeling that if some other curiosity from the Burgess Shale had survived instead, beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion.
11/wsj_1158:But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all, the universe is a big place, and given the right conditions, sympathetic to creating some form of life.
11/wsj_1158:Surely at some other cosmic address a Gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze to explain why, paleontologically speaking, "it is, indeed, a wonderful life." 
11/wsj_1159:The Justice Department scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law. 
11/wsj_1159:They discourage prosecutors, under certain circumstances, from seeking court orders seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial.
11/wsj_1159:Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants, as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures, has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars.
11/wsj_1159:Critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains. 
11/wsj_1159:In the new guidelines, the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial, "the government will not seek to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of the defendant" and "will not seek. . .to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them." 
11/wsj_1159:Mr. Runkel declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants. "The impact, if there is any, will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use {racketeering charges} is made in individual cases" by Justice Department officials in Washington, he said. 
11/wsj_1159:In a memorandum describing the guidelines, Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis Jr. said that government efforts to freeze defendants' assets pending racketeering prosecutions "have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press." But Mr. Runkel said the government isn't "backing off on these kinds of matters at all." 
11/wsj_1160:The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California's earthquake relief efforts.
11/wsj_1160:The state had sought as much as $4.1 billion in relief, but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for $2.85 billion in aid, the bulk of which would go to California, with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo. 
11/wsj_1160:According to the state department of finance, a one-penny increase in the state's six-cent per dollar sales tax could raise $3 billion. 
11/wsj_1160:Willie Brown, speaker of California's Assembly, said that Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks. 
11/wsj_1160:According to a spokesman, the governor is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes.
11/wsj_1160:One immediate source of money is an emergency fund set up by Gov. Deukmejian.
11/wsj_1160:The fund has about $1 billion and is set up to handle "precisely the kind of emergency" the state faces, said Tom Beermann, the Governor's deputy press secretary.
11/wsj_1160:And then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period after the temporary tax increase ends, said Cindy Katz, assistant director of the state department of finance. 
11/wsj_1160:A sales tax increase would require two-thirds approval in both houses of the state's legislature.
11/wsj_1160:But observers expect broad support. "If there's an emergency and there aren't sufficient funds from elsewhere, I think the attitude will be supportive," said Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce. 
11/wsj_1160:But others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state's earthquake relief tab.
11/wsj_1160:Since the late 1970s, California property owners have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a state ballot initiative known as Proposition 13. 
11/wsj_1160:But Gov. Deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis. 
11/wsj_1160:Not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs. "It's possible, though not probable," that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help, said Quentin Kopp, chairman of the state senate's transportation committee. 
11/wsj_1160:The claims, which were filed with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court, are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called Cypress structure viaduct. 
11/wsj_1160:The men can defeat immunities that states often assert in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes. 
11/wsj_1160:A Board of Control spokesman said the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment.

11/wsj_1161:It was priced at a spread of 55 basis points above the Treasury's 10-year note.

11/wsj_1162:But a chance to fill out sales-tax records is rarely one of them. 
11/wsj_1162:Red tape is the bugaboo of small business.
11/wsj_1162:Ironically, the person who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active, results-oriented sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and record-keeping demands of federal, state and local regulators.
11/wsj_1162:Yet every business owner has to face the mound of forms and regulations -- and often is the only one available to tackle it. 
11/wsj_1162:There is hope of change.
11/wsj_1162:Thus, optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape -- just as soon as Uncle Sam gets around to arranging it.
11/wsj_1162:Meanwhile, they tackle the mounds of paper -- and fantasize about a dream world where bulk-mail postal regulations and government inspectors are banished. 
11/wsj_1162:To find out what red tape riles entrepreneurs most, the Journal asked a completely unscientific, random sample of business owners to fantasize about the forms and regulations they would most like to get lost in the mail. 
11/wsj_1162:They concede that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good, and even to their own businesses. 
11/wsj_1162:Rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior, generally the best regarded form of red tape, "create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous competitors away," says Sidney West, president of TechDesign International Inc., a Springfield, Va., business that designs telecommunication and other products.
11/wsj_1162:Some gripes about red tape are predictable: Architects complain about a host of building regulations, auto leasing companies about car insurance rules.
11/wsj_1162:Determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects, says Mark Dooling, president of Dooling & Co., a Newton, Mass., architectural firm.
11/wsj_1162:There is such a maze of federal, state and local codes that "building inspectors are backing away from interpreting them," Mr. Dooling says. 
11/wsj_1162:Taxi, leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to complying with state insurance laws and a host of agencies. "It's very costly and time-consuming," says Phil Rosen, a partner in Fleet & Leasing Management Inc., a Boston car-leasing company.
11/wsj_1162:One senior executive at his firm spends nearly 20% of his time on insurance, he says. 
11/wsj_1162:Other forms of red tape are more pervasive.
11/wsj_1162:ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS: Next to medical insurance, "costs of compliance" are the fastest-growing expense at Impco Inc., a Providence, R.I., chemical company.
11/wsj_1162:Mr. Gebhard adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5% and 7.5% of Impco's total operating expenses. 
11/wsj_1162:Eastern Reproduction Corp., a Waltham, Mass., maker of thin metal precision parts, must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire, police, hospital and plumbing authorities, says Robert Maguire, president.
11/wsj_1162:It's especially nettlesome "if you're on the road and you're the one responsible," says Eddie Brown, president of Brown Capital Management Inc., a Baltimore money-management firm. 
11/wsj_1162:EMPLOYEE MANUALS: Revising employee manuals on pensions, health care and other subjects costs over $25,000 a year for Bert Giguiere, president of Professional Agricultural Management Inc., a Fresno, Calif., provider of business services to farmers.
11/wsj_1162:An employer leaves itself open to a great deal of liability if its employee manuals don't reflect the most recent laws, he says.
11/wsj_1162:SALES TAX RECORDS: Advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales -- but the exemption comes at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews.
11/wsj_1162:To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties, these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they didn't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense. "You need one person to just take care of sales tax," says Jennie Tong, executive vice president of Lee Liu & Tong Advertising Inc., New York. 
11/wsj_1163:Ms. Bogart, an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific," is decidedly downtown.
11/wsj_1163:Trinity Rep meanwhile is one of the nation's oldest and most respected regional theaters, still hosting an annual "A Christmas Carol." 
11/wsj_1163:How would this bastion of traditional values fare in Ms. Bogart's iconoclastic hands?
11/wsj_1163:It was a predictable revival of her prize-winning off-Broadway anthology of Bertolt Brecht's theoretical writings, called "No Plays, No Poetry." 
11/wsj_1163:Now, with the opening of Maxim Gorky's bourgeois-bashing "Summerfolk," Ms. Bogart has laid her cards on the table.
11/wsj_1163:Hers is a hand that will test the mettle of her audiences.
11/wsj_1163:And Gorky, considered the father of Soviet socialist realism, did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques. 
11/wsj_1163:Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism.
11/wsj_1163:And "Summerfolk," penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to Chekhov's "Cherry Orchard," is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers.
11/wsj_1163:Along the way there also are lots of romantic dalliances. 
11/wsj_1163:Despite the absence of samovars (and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down), the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton, with boaters and fishing poles aplenty. 
11/wsj_1163:Like Peter Sellars, Ms. Bogart manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls, sprawling them on staircases, dangling them off tables, even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring-do.
11/wsj_1163:There are moments in this "Summerfolk" when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house (which looks like a parody of Frank Lloyd Wright and is designed by Victoria Petrovich) spout philosophic bon mots with the self-conscious rat-a-tat-tat pacing of "Laugh In." "Talk hurts from where it spurts," one of them says.
11/wsj_1163:The clash of ideologies survives this treatment, but the nuance and richness of Gorky's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle.
11/wsj_1163:As for the humor that Gorky's text provides, when repainted in such broad strokes (particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble) it looks and sounds forced. 
11/wsj_1163:Here she has the aid of her longtime associate Jeff Helpern, whom she appointed Trinity's first-ever musical director and whom she equipped with a spanking new $60,000 sound system and recording studio.
11/wsj_1163:For Gorky, Mr. Helpern provided an aural collage of Debussy and Rachmaninoff, which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view. 
11/wsj_1163:Like Brecht, and indeed Ezra Pound, Ms. Bogart has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt to "make it new." Indeed, during a recent post-production audience discussion, the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" so that the song's "original beauty comes through," surmounting the cliche.
11/wsj_1163:The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation, a vision so at odds with the playwright's that the two points of view nullify, rather than illuminate, each other. 
11/wsj_1163:Ms. Bogart's cast is part and parcel of the problem.
11/wsj_1163:Janice Duclos, in addition to possessing one of the evening's more impressive vocal instruments, brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of Olga, everybody's favorite mom.
11/wsj_1164:(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 
11/wsj_1164:It was the start of a boom in unfriendly, even ungentlemanly, mergers. 
11/wsj_1164:On July 18, 1974, International Nickle of Canada -- advised by Morgan -- offered $28 a share, equal to $157 million, for ESB, a Philadelphia battery maker.
11/wsj_1164:"ESB is aware that a hostile tender offer is being made by a foreign company for all of ESB's shares," said F.J. Port, ESB's president. "Hostile" thus entered the merger-acquisition lexicon.
11/wsj_1164:Joseph Flom, of Skadden, Arps, Slote, Meagher & Flom, which became a leading legal firm in merger cases, said the case "made takeovers respectable." 
11/wsj_1164:ESB spurned Inco and within five days ESB had a "white knight" as United Aircraft -- headed by Harry Gray, a shrewdly friendly acquirer of companies -- offered $34 a share.
11/wsj_1164:ESB on July 29 accepted the Inco offer and the brief battle -- unlike the intricate and lengthy big takeovers of 1984-1989 -- was over.
11/wsj_1164:Inco paid Morgan an advisory fee of about $250,000, a paltry figure by today's measures.
11/wsj_1164:Early this year Morgan and three other investment houses each received $25 million in advisory fees from Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts in its $25 billion friendly buy-out of RJR Nabisco. 
11/wsj_1165:HomeFed Corp. said third-quarter net income slid 14% to $23.9 million, or $1.10 per fully diluted share, from $27.9 million, or $1.21 a fully diluted share, because of increased bad assets and unexpected trouble in unloading foreclosed property. 
11/wsj_1165:The decline surprised analysts and jolted HomeFed's stock, which lost 8.6% of its value, closing at $38.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, down $3.625. 
11/wsj_1165:HomeFed had been one of the handful of large West Coast thrifts that in recent quarters had counteracted interest-rate problems dogging the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the furious California housing market.
11/wsj_1165:Analysts had been projecting fully diluted earnings in the third quarter in the range of about $1.30 a share. 
11/wsj_1165:Some $380 million of the troubled assets is repossessed real estate, a 55.6% surge from the $244.2 million of repossesed property HomeFed held a year ago.
11/wsj_1165:HomeFed has $17.9 billion of assets. 
11/wsj_1165:HomeFed said most of the troubled assets are apartment complexes, shopping malls and other commercial real estate.
11/wsj_1165:It said sales of such properties were slower than anticipated in the third quarter, but it expects sales to pick up in the rest of the year. 
11/wsj_1165:HomeFed said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the California market.
11/wsj_1165:But HomeFed said it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new capital requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government's massive thrift bailout bill.
11/wsj_1165:It said its real-estate operations earned a record $21.7 million, more than double year-earlier real estate profit of $9 million.
11/wsj_1165:And analysts said they see no signs of an imminent swoon in California real estate, even with last week's earthquake. 
11/wsj_1165:For the nine months, HomeFed earned $82.5 million, or $3.52 a fully diluted share, a 4.3% increase from year-earlier net income of $79.1 million, or $3.43 a fully diluted share. 
11/wsj_1166:Yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were little changed in the latest week. 
11/wsj_1166:The average yield on six-month CDs of $50,000 and less slipped to 7.96% from 8.00%, according to Banxquote Money Markets, an information service based here.
11/wsj_1166:On one-year CDs of $50,000 and less, the average slid to 8.02% from 8.06%.
11/wsj_1166:"Because of shrinkage in the economy, rates can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon," said Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote. "It's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon." 
11/wsj_1166:The average yield on small-denomination three-month CDs moved up two-hundredths of a percentage point in the latest week to 7.85%.
11/wsj_1166:So-called jumbo CDs, typically in denominations of $90,000 and up, also usually follow T-bills and interest rate trends in general more than those aimed at small investors.
11/wsj_1166:At Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, for example, the yield on a small denomination six-month CD fell about a quarter of a percentage point to 8.06%.
11/wsj_1166:In California, Bank of America dropped the yield on both six-month and one-year "savings" CDs to 8.33% from 8.61%. 
11/wsj_1166:Yields on money-market deposits were unchanged at an average 6.96% for $50,000 and less and down just a hundredth of a percentage point to 7.41% for jumbo deposits. 
11/wsj_1167:Lion Nathan and PepsiCola Australia, a unit of PepsiCo Inc. of the U.S., didn't say why Cadbury Schweppes will no longer hold the franchise. 
11/wsj_1168:Wang Laboratories Inc. has sold $25 million of assets and reached agreements in principle to sell an additional $187 million shortly, Richard Miller, president, said at the annual meeting. 
11/wsj_1168:He said Wang had reached an agreement with a "major financial firm" to sell for $150 million its domestic equipment lease portfolio and that of its Wang Credit Corp. subsidiary.
11/wsj_1168:He said it also agreed to sell a portion of its European real estate unit for $37 million. 
11/wsj_1168:Mr. Miller said that Wang has already sold some $12 million of miscellaneous assets and disclosed that it had received $13 million from Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, in the previously announced sale of its Stirling, Scotland, plant. 
11/wsj_1168:Mr. Miller repeated that in the next six months he plans to sell another $200 million to $300 million of assets to repay debt and reduce interest costs at Wang, a minincomputer maker in Lowell, Mass. 
11/wsj_1169:The Tokyo maker of ceramic capacitors said it purchased a plant in Plymouth.
11/wsj_1169:H. in Germany, said the latest venture is designed to meet demand for electric parts in European Community countries ahead of the creation of the unified market by the end of 1992. 
11/wsj_1169:Murata expects sales at the unit of about 1.5 billion yen in the first year. 
11/wsj_1170:But it said the year-earlier results included gains of $23.5 million from divestitures. 
11/wsj_1170:For the nine months, the company said profit fell 49% to $23.5 million from $46 million in the year-earlier quarter, which included divestiture-related gains of $50.6 million.
11/wsj_1171:Benjamin Jacobson & Sons has been the New York Stock Exchange specialist firm in charge of trading stock in UAL Corp. and its predecessors since the early 1930s. 
11/wsj_1171:At first UAL didn't open because of an order imbalance.
11/wsj_1171:But we like to call it 'controlled chaos, '" said 47-year-old Robert J. Jacobson Jr., grandson of the firm's founder.
11/wsj_1171:Who was doing all the selling? "Options traders, arbitrage traders -- everyone," said Mr. Bates, cooling down with a carton of apple juice after the close yesterday.
11/wsj_1171:Both Jacobson traders, who had been hoping UAL trading would get back to normal, read the news about the unraveling of UAL takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning.
11/wsj_1171:The news told them it would be a while longer before UAL resumed trading like a regular airline stock after months of gyrations.
11/wsj_1171:There were rumors of $148-a-share trades. 
11/wsj_1171:Jacobson and Bates but four other Jacobson partners, all doing their specialist-firm job of tugging buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market.
11/wsj_1171:About 30 floor traders crammed near the UAL post most of the day, and probably hundreds more came and went -- a "seething mass," as one trader described it.
11/wsj_1171:With 15 seconds of trading to go, Mr. Jacobson, with what voice he had left, announced to the trading mob: "We're going to trade one price on the bell." That meant no trading would occur in the final seconds, as a way of making sure that last-second orders aren't subjected to a sudden price swing that would upset customers. 
11/wsj_1171:In Chicago, a UAL spokesman, "by way of policy," declined to comment on the company's stock or the specialists' performance. 
11/wsj_1172:The Confederation of British Industry's latest survey shows that business executives expect a pronounced slowdown, largely because of a 16-month series of interest-rate increases that has raised banks' base lending rates to 15%. 
11/wsj_1172:"The outlook has deteriorated since the summer, with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill," said David Wigglesworth, chairman of the industry group's economic committee.
11/wsj_1172:Of 1,224 companies surveyed, 31% expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery, while only 28% plan to spend more. 
11/wsj_1172:Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson views the high rates as his chief weapon against inflation, which was ignited by tax cuts and loose credit policies in 1986 and 1987.
11/wsj_1172:Fending off attacks on his economic policies in a House of Commons debate yesterday, Mr. Lawson said inflation "remains the greatest threat to our economic well-being" and promised to take "whatever steps are needed" to choke it off.
11/wsj_1172:David Owen, U.K. economist with Kleinwort Benson Group, reduced his growth forecast for 1990 to 0.7% from 1.2% and termed the risk of recession next year "quite high." But he said the downturn probably won't become a "major contraction" similar to those of 1974 and 1982. 
11/wsj_1172:Britain's latest trade figures contained some positive news for the economy, such as a surge in the volume of exports, which were 8.5% higher than a year earlier.
11/wsj_1172:The resulting #1.9 billion merchandise trade deficit was partly offset by an assumed surplus of #300 million in so-called invisible items, which include income from investments, services and official transfers. 
11/wsj_1172:Despite the narrowing of the monthly trade gap, economists expect the current account deficit for all of 1989 to swell to about #20 billion from #14.6 billion in 1988.
11/wsj_1172:Increasingly, economists say the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of British industry. "When the country gets wealthier, we tend to buy high-quality imports," Mr. Owen said. 
11/wsj_1173:Vickers PLC, a British aerospace, defense and automotive conglomerate, said it reached an agreed cash bid of #108.2 million ($173.3 million) for Ross Catherall Group PLC, a maker of specialty alloy and ceramics. 
11/wsj_1173:The company said it expects to receive acceptances for its offer of 253 pence ($4.05) per share representing at least 67% of Ross Catherall's issued share capital, or 12.7 million ordinary shares. 
11/wsj_1173:Vickers said its offer also includes an option to receive a redeemable loan note in lieu of cash.
11/wsj_1173:The company said its acquisition of Ross Catherall will be covered largely by cash raised in its July disposal of Howson-Algraphy for #241.7 million. 
11/wsj_1174:"People in this business have been insulated," says Josh Pons, a horse breeder from Bel Air, Md. "But the real future of this game is in a number of people owning a few horses." 
11/wsj_1174:But experts caution that this isn't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet. "It's a big-risk business," warns Charles C. Mihalek, a Lexington attorney and former Kentucky state securities commissioner. "You have to go into it firmly believing that it's the kind of investment where you can lose everything." 
11/wsj_1174:A group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of Spendthrift, hoping to rebuild it. 
11/wsj_1174:From 1974 to 1984, prices for the best yearlings at the summer sales rose 918% to an average of $544,681.
11/wsj_1174:Since then, prices have slumped, to an average of $395,374 this summer.
11/wsj_1174:Even while they move outside their traditional tony circle, racehorse owners still try to capitalize on the elan of the sport.
11/wsj_1174:Glossy brochures circulated at racetracks gush about the limelight of the winner's circle and high-society schmoozing.
11/wsj_1174:"It's just a matter of marketing and promoting ourselves," says Headley Bell, a fifth-generation horse breeder from Lexington. 
11/wsj_1174:For starters, racehorse buyers have to remember the basic problem of such ventures: These beasts don't come with warranties.
11/wsj_1174:And for every champion, there are plenty of nags.
11/wsj_1174:Katherine Voss, a veteran trainer at the Laurel, Md., track, offers neophytes a sobering tour of a horse barn, noting that only three of about a dozen horses have won sizable purses. 
11/wsj_1174:One brown two-year-old filly was wheezing from a cold, while another had splints on its legs, keeping both animals from the racetrack. "You can see the highs and lows of the business all under one roof," she tells the group. "There aren't too many winners." 
11/wsj_1174:Some badly managed partnerships have burned investors, sometimes after they received advice from industry "consultants." So owners have developed a "code of ethics," outlining rules for consultants and agents, and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest. 
11/wsj_1174:But some are skeptical of the code's effectiveness. "The industry is based on individual honesty," says Cap Hershey, a Lexington horse farmer and one of the investors who bought Spendthrift. 
11/wsj_1175:BUELL INDUSTRIES Inc. halved its quarterly dividend to five cents a share, payable Nov. 17 to stock of record Nov. 3.
11/wsj_1175:Buell recently said it would incur an aftertax charge of about $3.6 million in its fourth quarter ending Tuesday, in connection with the sale and discontinuance of several lines at a plant.
11/wsj_1175:The Waterbury, Conn., maker of industrial fasteners and metal stampings has 2.3 million shares outstanding. 
11/wsj_1176:Dunkin' Donuts, based in Randolph, Mass., previously said it would explore "alternatives," including a leveraged buy-out of the company, but hadn't set a date for submission of proposals. 
11/wsj_1176:Dunkin' Donuts' announcement followed DD Acquisition's request to the Delaware Court of Chancery Monday to set a trial date for its suit against the company.
11/wsj_1177:Combustion Engineering Inc. said third-quarter net income of $22.8 million, reversing a $91.7 million year-earlier loss. 
11/wsj_1177:The Stamford, Conn., power-generation products and services company said per-share earnings were 56 cents compared with the year-ago loss of $2.39.
11/wsj_1177:Net in the latest quarter included a pretax gain of $22.4 million from the sale of Combustion's minority interest in Stein Industrie to GEC Alsthom N.V. of the Netherlands.
11/wsj_1177:Last year's results reflected a gain of $28.2 million on disposition of assets and a $165 million pretax provision mainly from costs of completing certain waste-to-energy and other power plants. 
11/wsj_1178:Claude Bebear, chairman and chief executive officer, of Axa-Midi Assurances, pledged to retain employees and management of Farmers Group Inc., including Leo E. Denlea Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, if Axa succeeds in acquiring Farmers. 
11/wsj_1178:Mr. Bebear made his remarks at a breakfast meeting with reporters here yesterday as part of a tour in which he is trying to rally support in the U.S. for the proposed acquisition.
11/wsj_1178:The bid is part of Sir James Goldsmith's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC, the British tobacco, retailing, paper and financial-services giant that acquired Farmers last year for $5.2 billion.
11/wsj_1178:Any acquisition of Farmers needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers operates, and Mr. Bebear's trip will take him to Idaho, Arizona and New York after his stay here; he will meet with insurance regulators, legislators, industry excutives and the press. 
11/wsj_1178:Although Axa has been rebuffed by Farmers and hasn't had any meetings with management, Mr. Bebear nonetheless appears to be trying to woo the company's executives with promises of autonomy and new-found authority under Axa.
11/wsj_1178:He said Mr. Denlea would be a member of the top management team of the Axa-Midi group of companies, and would "help define policies and strategies of the group." 
11/wsj_1178:Those credits result because of taxes that Farmers, as the management company, has paid, and have "proved to be very important for the exchanges," a Farmers spokesman said.
11/wsj_1179:Honeywell Inc., Minneapolis, said it completed its previously announced sale of 16% of the shares outstanding in its Japanese joint venture, Yamatake-Honeywell, for $280 million. 
11/wsj_1179:The stake was acquired by a group of 10 Japanese financial institutions and industrial corporations, primarily insurance companies, Honeywell said. 
11/wsj_1179:Proceeds will be used to repurchase as many as 10 million shares of Honeywell stock, as previously announced. 
11/wsj_1179:Honeywell said a second sale of Yamatake-Honeywell is still being negotiated.
11/wsj_1180:It is payable Nov. 30 to units of record Oct. 31.
11/wsj_1180:The money manager is controlled 67.7% by its top officers and top officers of Oppenheimer & Co., a securities firm.
11/wsj_1181:Bank of Montreal said it added 850 million Canadian dollars (US$725.8 million) to its reserves against losses on Third World loans, bringing the total it has set aside this year to C$1 billion. 
11/wsj_1181:The bank said the C$1 billion in reserves will result in a charge of C$595 million against earnings but said it still expects to report a profit for the year ending Tuesday.
11/wsj_1181:The bank reported net income of C$389 million for the nine months ended July 31.
11/wsj_1181:The bank said the increase in loan-loss provisions won't affect the payment of dividends. 
11/wsj_1181:The bank said reserves now amount to 61% of its total less-developed-country exposure.
11/wsj_1181:Excluding Mexico, reserves equal 95% of LDC exposure. 
11/wsj_1181:In Toronto Stock Exchange trading, Bank of Montreal closed at C$33.25, up 87.5 Canadian cents. 
11/wsj_1182:Knight-Ridder Inc. said third-quarter earnings jumped 18%, partly because of the sale of two of its media properties. 
11/wsj_1182:The latest results include a gain of $4.2 million, or eight cents a share, on the sale of television stations in Oklahoma City and Flint, Mich. 
11/wsj_1182:Gains in advertising revenue, however, resulted in operating profit of $78.4 million -- up 20% from $65.6 million. 
11/wsj_1183:ALBERTA ENERGY Co., Calgary, said it filed a preliminary prospectus for an offering of common shares.
11/wsj_1183:The natural resources development concern said proceeds will be used to repay long-term debt, which stood at 598 million Canadian dollars (US$510.6 million) at the end of 1988.
11/wsj_1183:The company plans to raise between C$75 million and C$100 million from the offering, according to a spokeswoman at Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd., lead underwriter.
11/wsj_1184:The government's startling allegations, filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against GE in Philadelphia federal district court, challenge the motives and veracity of the nation's third-largest defense contractor. 
11/wsj_1184:In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday, GE asserted that "prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses, distorted documents and ignored important facts." The company attacked the government's allegations as "reckless and baseless mudslinging," and said its management "promptly and accurately reported" to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices. 
11/wsj_1184:The case strikes at the corporate image of GE, which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative, and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if Pentagon and Justice Department officials take a tough stance. 
11/wsj_1184:The company has been considered an industry leader in advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices.
11/wsj_1184:But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of "widespread" fraudulent billing practices. 
11/wsj_1184:The problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company's Space Systems division, which has been the focus of two separate overcharge prosecutions by the government since 1985.
11/wsj_1184:The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case, in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos, reports and documents.
11/wsj_1184:Last November, a federal grand jury indicted GE on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the Army of $21 million on a logistics computer contract. 
11/wsj_1184:The company, for its part, maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney-client communications that shouldn't be turned over to prosecutors.
11/wsj_1184:The government's 136-page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985, when GE was accused of defrauding the Pentagon by illegally claiming cost overruns on Minuteman missile contracts.
11/wsj_1184:GE pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $1 million in the Minuteman case, which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the Philadelphia court. 
11/wsj_1184:In order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts, prosecutors contend that "high-level GE executives" and company lawyers provided "misleading statements" to then-Air Force Secretary Verne Orr and other Pentagon officials during a series of meetings in 1985. 
11/wsj_1184:Overall, the government contends that GE's disclosure efforts largely were intended to "curry favor" with Pentagon officials without detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities uncovered by company investigations. 
11/wsj_1184:Prosecutors depict a company that allegedly sat on damaging evidence of overcharges from 1983 to 1985, despite warnings from an internal auditor.
11/wsj_1184:GE, which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents, countered that senior GE managers didn't find out about questionable billing practices until 1985, and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. Orr at his first meeting with company representatives.
11/wsj_1184:Subsequent meetings, initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts, were held to familiarize Mr. Orr with the company's self-policing procedures and to disclose additional information, according to GE. 
11/wsj_1184:GE's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity. 
11/wsj_1184:The company's conduct "does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent, ratification or cover-up," GE's brief asserts. "On the contrary, it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters." 
11/wsj_1185:Applied Solar Energy Corp. of City of Industry, Calif., said it and its majority shareholder, American Cyanamid Co., signed a non-binding letter of intent for the acquisition of Applied Solar by McDonnell Douglas Corp. for about $38 million. 
11/wsj_1185:The proposed acquisition provides for a cash payment of $10 a share at closing and a contingent payment of as much as 80 cents a share placed in escrow.
11/wsj_1185:Details of the escrow agreement haven't been completed, the companies said.
11/wsj_1185:There are 3.5 million shares of Applied Solar, of which American Cyanamid owns 2.7 million.
11/wsj_1185:Completion of the acquisition is subject to execution of a definitive agreement, approval by all three companies' boards and the approval of Applied Solar's shareholders.
11/wsj_1185:An Applied Solar spokesman said completion is expected at the end of the year or early next year. 
11/wsj_1185:A spokeswoman for the St. Louis aerospace and defense concern said it wanted the acquistion because Applied Solar is involved in solar cells and solid-state laser components, and this fits with McDonnell's business of laser applications for military space. 
11/wsj_1186:Brian Hemming, a spokesman for the company's committee of independent directors, established in May to solicit and evaluate offers for the company, said it was expected to make an announcement early this morning.
11/wsj_1186:But Mr. Hemming said he wasn't aware of the nature of the talks under way between committee members and their advisers. 
11/wsj_1186:Analysts have speculated in recent days that the value of offers received by the committee fell well short of what they had hoped, or even that the company's chairman, president and chief executive officer, Garth Drabinsky, is the only bidder for the company as a whole.
11/wsj_1187:London share prices closed sharply lower Tuesday on the back of Wall Street's steep drop and renewed fears over U.K. economic fundamentals.
11/wsj_1187:Dealers said the initial pressure came from mildly disappointing U.K. trade figures for September and a worrisome report by the Confederation of British Industry that a decline in orders for manufactured goods is depressing both business optimism and investment plans for the coming year. 
11/wsj_1187:Volume was a modest 405.4 million shares traded, but better than the year's lowest turnover of 276.8 million Monday. 
11/wsj_1187:Market watchers also noted an absence of institutional interest later in the session helped pave the way for broader declines when Wall Street opened weaker. 
11/wsj_1187:Insurance stocks provided some early support to the market, partly on favorable brokerage recommendatons and talk of continental European interest in British life and composite insurers. 
11/wsj_1187:Dealers said the market didn't react substantially to Ford Motor Co. 's disclosure to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it will seek 100% of Jaguar's shares outstanding when U.K. government share regulations are lifted at the end of next year. 
11/wsj_1187:Tokyo stocks closed easier, posting their first loss in six trading days, partly because of programmed index-linked selling by trust investment funds in the afternoon session. 
11/wsj_1187:On Tuesday, the Tokyo stock price index of all first section issues was down 6.31 at 2681.22.
11/wsj_1187:Such sentiment is being supported by word that a large amount of cash from investment trust funds is scheduled to enter the market later this week and in early November. 
11/wsj_1187:The expected amount is said to be 700 billion yen ($4.93 billion) to 1.05 trillion yen -- the second largest amount this year in a given period, following the record high set at the end of July, according to market observers. 
11/wsj_1187:In addition to a large amount of investment trust fund cash, analysts generally see the market environment improving compared with the past couple of weeks. 
11/wsj_1187:Buying activity Tuesday centered on a wide range of midcapitalization, domestic demand-related shares whose prices range from 1,000 to 2,000 yen.
11/wsj_1187:Investors expect these shares will be targets of investment trust funds, which often buy small amounts spread across a wide range of issues. 
11/wsj_1187:Share prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange closed sharply lower in thin dealings as worried investors remained idle as the result of two potentially destabilizing domestic developments.
11/wsj_1187:On Sunday, the governing Christian Democratic Union suffered a series of setbacks, the extent of which became fully known only late Monday, in municipal elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
11/wsj_1187:Traders say investors are worried that the CDU won't be able to hold office in federal elections at the end of 1990. 
11/wsj_1187:And statements by the chairman of the IG Metall labor union, Franz Steinkuehler, also cast a cloud over trading, dealers said.
11/wsj_1187:Mr. Steinkuehler said at a convention in West Berlin that the union has to prepare for "a big fight" to achieve its main goal of a 35-hour workweek, down from current 37-hour workweek. 
11/wsj_1187:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
11/wsj_1188:Directors of Bergen Bank and Den Norske Creditbank, two of Norway's leading banks, announced they had agreed to the formal merger of the banks. 
11/wsj_1188:The merger would create Scandinavia's seventh largest bank, with combined assets of 210 billion Norwegian kroner ($30.3 billion). 
11/wsj_1188:The merger requires the approval of Norwegian authorities. 
11/wsj_1189:Savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject whites, the Office of Thrift Supervision said. 
11/wsj_1189:The office, an arm of the Treasury, said it doesn't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus can't determine why blacks are rejected more often. 
11/wsj_1189:Sen. Alan Dixon (D, Ill.), chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs, said, "I'm not a statistician.
11/wsj_1189:But when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites -- and in some cities, it is three and four times as often -- I conclude that discrimination is part of the problem." 
11/wsj_1189:James Grohl, a spokesman for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, said, "The data is a red flag, but lacking the financial data you can't make a case that discrimination is widespread." The trade group official added: "Certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it." 
11/wsj_1189:Sen. Dixon held the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required regulators to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending.
11/wsj_1189:The legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race, sex and income level of borrowers, but that information won't be gathered in new studies for several months at least. 
11/wsj_1189:But John LaWare, a Fed governor, told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the Fed's believes the vast majority of banks aren't discriminating.
11/wsj_1189:Several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination. "We would be the first to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years" to developing examinations for discrimination, said Jonathan Fiechter, a top official of the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
11/wsj_1189:"If we've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly," said Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the banking committee, "then that is a matter that needs remedy now, not six months from now, or six years from now, or 26 years from now." 
11/wsj_1189:Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws.
11/wsj_1189:The comptroller's office said it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987.
11/wsj_1189:The comptroller's office also said that of 37,000 complaints it received since January 1987, only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending.
11/wsj_1189:Mr. Fiechter said that among the possibilities being considered by regulators to fight discrimination is the use of "testers" -- government investigators who would pose as home buyers.
11/wsj_1189:The Department of Housing and Urban Development has used testers to investigate discrimination in rental housing.
11/wsj_1189:Using testers could be controversial with financial institutions, but Mr. Grohl said the U.S. League of Savings Institutions hadn't yet taken any position on the matter. 
11/wsj_1190:Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele-Communications Inc. 's plan to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc., a move that could lead to all-out war between the cable industry's two most powerful players. 
11/wsj_1190:Last week, Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $225 million for a 50% stake in its Showtime subsidiary, which is a distant second to Time's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay-TV networks to cable subscribers.
11/wsj_1190:Tele-Communications is HBO's largest customer, and the two have a number of other business relationships.
11/wsj_1190:The purchase of the Showtime stake is "a direct slap in our face," said one senior Time executive. 
11/wsj_1190:The executives say Time may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated, or may seek constraints that would prevent Tele-Communications from dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of Showtime. 
11/wsj_1190:Jerome Kern, Tele-Communications' chief outside counsel, said he wasn't aware of Time's legal plans.
11/wsj_1190:"It's hard to see how an investment by the largest {cable operator} in the weaker of the two networks is anti-competitive, when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest" cable operator, Mr. Kern said. 
11/wsj_1190:In its suit against Time, Viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and cable-programming networks gives the company too much market power.
11/wsj_1190:Together, they control nearly 40% of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.; Tele-Communications has a 21.8% stake, while Time Warner has a 17.8% stake.
11/wsj_1190:Viacom accuses Time in its suit of refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service, The Movie Channel, on Time's Manhattan Cable TV system, one of the nation's largest urban systems.
11/wsj_1190:Showtime has also accused HBO of locking up the lion's share of Hollywood's movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios.
11/wsj_1191:The Federal Trade Commission said it authorized its staff to seek a preliminary injunction barring Imo Industries Inc. from acquiring the shares outstanding of the U.S. unit of the British company, United Scientific Holdings PLC, for $69 million. 
11/wsj_1191:The FTC said it "had reason to believe that the proposed acquisition could substantially reduce competition" in the production of certain image intensifier tubes, which are important components of night-vision devices sold primarily to the defense industry. 
11/wsj_1191:Under federal law, if the court grants a preliminary injunction, the FTC must begin administrative proceedings to determine the legality of the proposed stock purchase within 20 days. 
11/wsj_1191:Officials at the United Scientific unit, Optic-Electronic Corp. of Garland, Texas, and at Imo Industries of Lawrenceville, N.J., couldn't be reached for comment. 
11/wsj_1192:The airline industry's fortunes, in dazzling shape for most of the year, have taken a sudden turn for the worse in the past few weeks. 
11/wsj_1192:Yesterday, USAir Group Inc., recently one of the industry's stellar performers, posted a worse-than-expected $77.7 million net loss for the period. 
11/wsj_1192:So far, the industry's fourth quarter isn't looking too strong either, prompting many analysts to slash earning projections for the rest of the year by as much as one-fourth.
11/wsj_1192:This turn of events has put a big damper on an industry that seemed almost invincible last spring, when fares were rising at double-digit rates and many carriers seemed to be growing fat on near-monopolies in certain markets.
11/wsj_1192:Just last week, for example, Trans World Airlines and Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways went so far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of $200 to $1,000 to certain frequent-flier members making trans-Atlantic flights in business class or first class.
11/wsj_1192:The industry's slowdown became apparent this month when AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, reported an 8.8% drop in third-quarter net income and said its fourth quarter would be "disappointing." Shortly before that, USAir had said its third-quarter results would be "significantly lower" than a year earlier.
11/wsj_1192:Yesterday, it provided the details: Its loss of $77.7 million, or $1.86 a share, contrasted with net of $68.5 million, or $1.58 a share, in the 1988 third quarter.
11/wsj_1192:The results surprised many analysts, because USAir has almost no competition in its Pittsburgh hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of Piedmont Airlines.
11/wsj_1192:"Nobody was expecting this size of a loss," said Paul Karos, an analyst with First Boston Corp.
11/wsj_1192:In announcing the results, USAir cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials have named recently.
11/wsj_1192:To try to combat the traffic slowdown, airlines started reducing fares; average fares rose only 1.7% in August, in contrast to increases of 16% each in February and March.
11/wsj_1192:Airlines tried to restrict the program substantially by limiting the offer to certain days of the week, but it still was apparently used far more heavily than the airlines expected. 
11/wsj_1192:Labor costs, which leveled off in the past few years because of lower pay scales for newer employees, are on the upswing again at many carriers.
11/wsj_1192:And some carriers are facing other unexpected headaches: USAir, for example, blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo last month. "We cannot quantify the total adverse effects of Hugo," said Edwin Colodny, chairman and president of USAir Group. 
11/wsj_1192:Airline Economics Inc., an aviation consulting firm, is projecting an industrywide operating profit of $2.5 billion for 1989, compared with earlier forecasts of $3 billion to $3.5 billion.
11/wsj_1193:Turns out that next year, Charlie Brown, Snoopy and the gang turn 40 -- and Scripps Howard's United Media unit, the syndicator and licensing agent for Charles Schulz's comic strip, sees a bonanza in licensing the cartoon characters to a bevy of advertisers for ads, tie-ins and promotions. 
11/wsj_1193:"Peanuts has become a major part of American culture," says Peter Shore, United Media's vice president of marketing and licensing.
11/wsj_1193:The yearlong schedule of festivities will be kicked off officially with a combination live and animation half-time special at the Super Bowl in January. 
11/wsj_1193:All the tie-ins, though, have some marketing experts questioning whether the party may go too far. "There are too many people participating," says Al Ries, of Trout & Ries, a Greenwich, Conn., marketing consulting firm. "If you want to cut through the clutter, you have to make your message as distinct, sharp and individual as possible.
11/wsj_1193:Metropolitan Life ad executives couldn't be reached about the use of the Peanuts characters by others.
11/wsj_1193:Norman Berry, the creative executive who was apparently squeezed out of Ogilvy & Mather in June, is returning to Ogilvy's parent company, WPP Group PLC. 
11/wsj_1193:Mr. Berry, 58, had resigned after being asked by Ogilvy 's chairman and chief executive officer, Kenneth Roman, to give up his title as creative head of the New York office and to take a fuzzier international role.
11/wsj_1193:RJR Nabisco Inc. awarded its national broadcast media-buying assignment to FCB/Leber Katz Partners, the New York outpost of Chicago-based Foote, Cone & Belding. 
11/wsj_1193:The naming of FCB/Leber Katz Partners as agency of record for Nabisco Brands Inc. and Planters LifeSavers Co. follows RJR Nabisco's announcement last week that it will disband its RJR Nabisco Broadcast division and dismiss its 14 employees Dec. 1. to cut costs.
11/wsj_1193:EARNINGS: Interpublic Group of Cos. said third-quarter net rose 15% to $6.9 million, or 21 cents a share, from $6 million, or 18 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
11/wsj_1193:HOLIDAY PROMOTION: PepsiCo Inc. will give away 4,000 sets of "Game Boy," Nintendo's new hand-held video game in a two-month promotion scheduled to begin Nov. 1.
11/wsj_1194:The investment will be made through IBM Australia Ltd., a unit of IBM, the two companies said yesterday. 
11/wsj_1194:The agreement requires approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board and National Companies and Securities Commission, and from shareholders of Paxus. 
11/wsj_1195:Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. 's consolidated debt totals 6.9 billion Australian dollars (US$5.32 billion), including A$1.6 billion of bonds convertible into shares. 
11/wsj_1195:Alan Bond, chairman and controlling shareholder of the cash-strapped Australian media, brewing, resources and property concern, disclosed the debt figures yesterday. 
11/wsj_1195:The disclosure follows last Friday's news that Bond Corp. incurred an overall loss of A$980.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, the largest loss in Australian corporate history. 
11/wsj_1195:The debt load would have been higher but for a reduction of A$5 billion over the past year from asset sales, Mr. Bond said at a business gathering. 
11/wsj_1195:Mr. Bond indicated the consolidated debt figures, which include debt of units such as Bell Group Ltd., will be published soon in Bond Corp. 's 1989 annual accounts. 
11/wsj_1195:Mr. Bond blamed rising Australian interest rates and the acquisition of Bell Group "with its very high levels of shortterm debt" for producing a condition "that was no longer sustainable. 
11/wsj_1195:"In order to restore confidence and ensure the support of our principal lenders," Mr. Bond said, "we embarked on fundamantal changes in the structure and direction of the group." 
11/wsj_1195:Mr. Bond forecast that by next June, "what will emerge will be a company with a honed sense of purpose . . . a stable balance sheet, with good-quality assets in brewing, telecommunications, media and property." 
11/wsj_1195:Some of the oil interests already have been sold. 
11/wsj_1196:Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc., Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich., estimated it will sell about as many cars in 1990 as the 75,000 it expects to deliver this year. 
11/wsj_1196:Erich Krampe, president of the U.S. sales arm of West German auto maker Daimler Benz AG, predicted luxury-car sales will rise to 840,000 in 1990 from 830,000 this year primarily because of the new Japanese makes. 
11/wsj_1196:Most of the growth, he said, will come in the $35,000-to-$50,000 price range, where Mercedes has a 35% U.S. market share.
11/wsj_1197:"A significant increase in gold sales to 248,279 ounces for the quarter from 188,726 in the third quarter of 1988 was more than offset by the continued decline in average gold price realization to $367 from $429 per ounce," the company said. 
11/wsj_1198:The Treasury plans to raise $1.8 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about $15.6 billion in short-term bills to redeem $13.81 billion in maturing bills. 
11/wsj_1198:The Treasury said it will alter the auctions unless it has assurance of enactment of legislation to raise the statutory debt limit before the scheduled auctions Monday. 
11/wsj_1199:Apogee Enterprises Inc. said profit for the third quarter ending Dec. 2 will fall below the year-earlier results because of an after-tax charge of $1.9 million related to a project that was guaranteed by the company. 
11/wsj_1199:A year ago, the Minneapolis glass products and aluminum window maker earned $4 million, or 30 cents a share, on revenue of $114 million. 
11/wsj_1199:Apogee said a subcontractor had severe cost overruns and was unable to fulfill the contract terms on its own, making it necessary for Apogee to advance cash to ensure completion of the project. 
11/wsj_1199:The company said its core businesses have performed well and it expects them to continue to do so in the remainder of the fiscal year. 
12/wsj_1200:Japan's production of cars, trucks and buses in September fell 4.1% from a year ago to 1,120,317 units because of a slip in exports, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said. 
12/wsj_1200:Demand has been growing consistently under the encouragement of pro-consumption government policies, an association spokesman said.
12/wsj_1200:He also said the introduction of a 3% consumption tax in April has helped sales.
12/wsj_1200:The new tax, though a source of general resentment among Japanese taxpayers, replaced a higher commodities tax that applied to automobiles. 
12/wsj_1200:Production of cars rose to 801,835 units in September, a 5.5% increase from a year earlier.
12/wsj_1200:Manufacturers produced 46,835 of the vehicles -- which have engines of 500 cubic centimeters or less -- an increase of 31,777 units. 
12/wsj_1200:Auto production for the first half of the fiscal year, which began in August, totaled 6,379,884 units, the association said.
12/wsj_1201:Stock of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. gyrated wildly yesterday amid speculation that one or more investors may challenge the UAL board's decision to remain independent instead of pursuing a buy-out or other transaction. 
12/wsj_1201:Late in the afternoon, several big purchases by Bear, Stearns, particularly a block of 200,000 shares at 2:43 p.m. at $150 a share, triggered a buying spree that took UAL up more than 18 points in the final hour of trading. 
12/wsj_1201:Volume was a tumultuous 4.9 million shares, or 22% of the 21.8 million UAL shares outstanding.
12/wsj_1201:The two most frequently rumored buyers, neither of whom would comment, were Coniston Partners, which battled the UAL board in 1987, and New York real estate developer Donald Trump, who recently made and withdrew an offer for American Airlines parent AMR Corp. However, one person familiar with UAL said the signs pointed to Coniston because Mr. Trump hasn't asked for permission to buy more than $15 million of stock under federal antitrust rules. 
12/wsj_1201:Takeover-stock traders, stung by their huge losses in UAL stock, remained eager for some action by an outside catalyst following the collapse Oct. 13 of a $300-a-share, $6.79 billion labor-management buy-out.
12/wsj_1201:Their hope was that the catalyst would seek to oust the board in a solicitation of shareholder consents. 
12/wsj_1201:I have never seen a case of incompetence shared by so many participants." 
12/wsj_1201:In 1986, Baker, Nye waged a proxy fight for control of Leaseway Transportation Inc. that ultimately led to Leaseway's being sold. 
12/wsj_1201:That gives them enormous leverage, including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose. 
12/wsj_1201:But the board's decision prompted many to bail out of the stock yesterday. "We had a lot of people who threw in the towel today," said Earl Ellis, a partner in Benjamin Jacobson & Sons, a specialist in trading UAL stock on the Big Board. 
12/wsj_1201:And a spokesman for Reliance Group Holdings Inc., which had held 7% of UAL before the first buy-out bid but later reduced its holdings below 5%, wouldn't comment. 
12/wsj_1201:The Los Angeles investor can't buy UAL stock, solicit shareholder consents or make a new offer unless he makes a formal offer of $300 a share or UAL accepts an offer below $300. 
12/wsj_1202:Times Mirror Co. said third-quarter net income fell 13% to $70.1 million, or 54 cents a share, compared with net income of $81 million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier. 
12/wsj_1202:The Los Angeles media concern said that the year-ago period included a $26.5 million gain from the sale of assets, primarily timberlands. 
12/wsj_1203:William Kaiser, president of the Kaiser Financial Group in Chicago, said the decline was almost certainly influenced by the early sell-off in the stock market, which partly reflected a weakening economy.
12/wsj_1203:He said the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing.
12/wsj_1203:Mr. Kaiser said traders could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets, which became noticeably weaker two to three weeks ago. 
12/wsj_1203:They might even step up sales in a falling market, he said, in an effort to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their treasuries. 
12/wsj_1203:Technically, Mr. Kaiser noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $1.24 to $1.26 range, thinking there was support at the $1.20 level.
12/wsj_1203:Betty Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities in New York, agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature.
12/wsj_1203:She said the market hit the $1.18 level at around 10 a.m. EDT where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders.
12/wsj_1203:Ms. Raptopoulos said the settling of strikes in Canada and Mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year.
12/wsj_1203:She thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $1.09 to $1.10 range. "I believe that as soon as the selling abates somewhat we could see a rally back to the $1.20 region," she added. 
12/wsj_1203:She noted that the preliminary estimate of the third-quarter gross national product is due out tomorrow and is expected to be up about 2.5% to 3%. "If the number is a little better, then copper will respond positively, if it is worse then more selling could ensue," she predicted. 
12/wsj_1203:I believe that number reflects a slowing economy." She said copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next Tuesday. 
12/wsj_1203:However, David Threlkeld, president of Threlkeld & Co., an international metals company, noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of 1988, and that projected production is below last year. 
12/wsj_1203:Mr. Threlkeld said the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three months, with declining use being the result. "But," he added, "we have had that exact same perception six times in the last six years." He noted that currently the ratio of available copper to consumption is about 3.5 weeks.
12/wsj_1203:If there isn't a recession, he said, "we will be out of copper by the end of March.
12/wsj_1203:If there is a recession that will change the statistical situation." He thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of $1.65 a pound, which was reached last year. 
12/wsj_1203:In the past Mr. Threlkeld has been known to have substantial long positionsthat is, he had bought copper futures in anticipation of rising prices -- in the copper futures market. 
12/wsj_1203:Several analysts and brokers said the petroleum market was ready to rally after two days of price declines from profit-taking.
12/wsj_1203:He noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of Soviet sales of precious metals to finance grain purchases, but the sales don't seem to have materialized.
12/wsj_1203:Mr. Kaiser noted that gold was more than 71 times the price of silver at the close yesterday, which is historically high. "The high ratio reflects the fact that silver is still regarded as about a half-industrial metal and its price lagging relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy," he said. 
12/wsj_1203:GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather.
12/wsj_1203:The sale to the Chinese government of 330,000 metric tons of wheat under the government's export enhancement program was announced after the close of trading Monday, but the sale was expected and failed to buoy prices yesterday, said Dale Gustafson, a futures analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
12/wsj_1203:A number of commercial grain users buttressed that opinion yesterday by buying certain corn options for delivery in March, indicating to analysts that the commercial companies would use the options to hedge against expected corn sales in next year's first quarter. 
12/wsj_1203:He said even though there was arbitrage buying in New York because of the weak dollar, cocoa fell to relentless pressure from bearish traders.
12/wsj_1203:But he noted that speculators apparently don't believe there is much more of a decline in store for cocoa.
12/wsj_1203:The December contract reached its life-of-contract low of $975 a ton on Oct. 11; its lifetime high was $1,735, set in 1988, and its recent high was $1,368, set in early August.
12/wsj_1204:Citizens First, which controls Citizens First National Bank and is based in Glen Rock, N.J., will pay a maximum of 40% in cash for the parent of Lakeland Savings Bank and the remainder in convertible preferred stock, with a liquidation value of $18 a share.
12/wsj_1204:The convertible preferred will pay dividends at 7.875% and be convertible into shares of Citizens First at a rate equal to 20% above the average closing price of the stock during a 20-day period prior to the transaction's completion.
12/wsj_1205:Color Systems Technology Inc., Los Angeles, said its major creditor, General Electric Pension Trust, agreed to convert $11.8 million of debt owed into 25% of Color System's fully diluted common stock. 
12/wsj_1205:The agreement also calls for General Electric Pension, a unit of General Electric Co., to receive as much as 10% of Color Systems' fully diluted common stock, depending on the proceeds from the sale of the AEI Film Library and its receivables.
12/wsj_1205:General Electric Pension took control of the 85-title library last month after Color Systems defaulted on the loan. 
12/wsj_1205:Color Systems, which converts black-and-white film to color videotape, posted a loss of $7.1 million, or $1.32 a share, on revenue of $10.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30.
12/wsj_1206:But the troubles of SCI TV are a classic tale of the leveraged buy-out excesses of the 1980s, especially the asset-stripping game. 
12/wsj_1206:SCI TV, which expects to release a plan to restructure $1.3 billion of debt in the next day or so, isn't just another LBO that went bad after piling on debt -- though it did do that.
12/wsj_1206:The cable and TV station company was an LBO of an LBO, a set of assets that were leveraged twice, enabling the blue-chip buy-out king Henry Kravis in 1987 to take more than $1 billion of cash out of the com- pany. 
12/wsj_1206:But it has left holders of SCI TV's junk bonds holding the bag, including some heavyweights that KKR might need to finance future deals, such as Kemper Financial Services, First Executive, Columbia Savings & Loan and Prudential Insurance Co. of America. 
12/wsj_1206:SCI TV's six stations once were part of Storer Communications.
12/wsj_1206:In this second LBO, KKR with one hand took more than $1 billion of cash out of the TV company's assets and moved it into the Storer cable operations, making them more valuable in a 1988 sale. (Storer also took $125 million of junior SCI TV bonds as partial payment for the TV assets.) 
12/wsj_1206:With the other hand, KKR put back into SCI TV less than 10% of the cash it had taken out, buying SCI TV common and preferred shares. 
12/wsj_1206:On Storer as a whole, KKR racked up compound annual returns of 60% in the three years it owned Storer. 
12/wsj_1206:Meanwhile, Mr. Gillett risks losing his entire equity investment of about $100 million in SCI TV if the company can't be restructured.
12/wsj_1206:With the TV business falling on hard times in recent years, analysts say that if SCI TV had to be liquidated today, it might fetch 30% less than in the 1987 buy-out, wiping out most of the company's junk-holders and its stockholders.
12/wsj_1206:Meanwhile, SCI TV can barely pay its cash interest bill, and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon reschedule a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due. 
12/wsj_1206:Negotiations "have started con- structively, but that's not to say we like this particular offer," says Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc., adviser to SCI TV junk-holders. 
12/wsj_1206:Mr. Gillett is said to be proud of his operating record; he has lifted some stations' ratings and turned around a Detroit station. 
12/wsj_1206:As for junk-holders, they're discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by KKR.
12/wsj_1206:The bonds of SCI TV now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about 60 cents on the dollar, according to R.D. Smith & Co. in New York, which trades distressed securities. 
12/wsj_1206:They would both give part of their combined $50 million in common equity in SCI TV to holders of SCI TV's $488 million of junk bonds, as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company. 
12/wsj_1206:They add that it isn't costing KKR anything to give up equity because of its big up-front cash profit on the buy-out, which they think contributed to SCI TV's current problems.
12/wsj_1206:Kemper, the biggest holder of senior SCI TV bonds, has refused to join the bond-holders committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options. 
12/wsj_1206:One investment banker who isn't involved in the deal says SCI TV needs at least $50 million of new equity to survive. 
12/wsj_1206:Junk-holders say they have a stick to beat KKR with: "The threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool" to extract money from KKR, says one big SCI TV holder.
12/wsj_1206:A big bankruptcy-court case might tarnish KKR's name, and provide new fuel for critics of LBOs in Washington and elsewhere.
12/wsj_1206:But with Seaman, KKR was only trying to salvage its original investment, says bankruptcy investor James Rubin of Sass Lamle Rubin in New York.
12/wsj_1207:The maker of household products said the new dividend is payable Dec. 1 to shares of record Nov. 10. 
12/wsj_1207:Rubbermaid officials said they aren't aware of any effort to take over the company, but believed the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened. "The board has stated repeatedly that Rubbermaid should be independent," said Walter W. Williams, Rubbermaid president. 
12/wsj_1207:Some changes to the plan were minor adjustments, but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any investor holds 25% or more of Rubbermaid's voting securities, each right held by others would entitle the holder to buy Rubbermaid shares with a market value of twice the right's exercise price. 
12/wsj_1207:Mr. Williams said the exercise price is $125, meaning holders would have the right to buy $250 of Rubbermaid stock for half price, diluting the investor's 25% stake. 
12/wsj_1208:The stock market went on a dizzying ride as UAL, parent of United Airlines, once again led shares into a breathtaking decline and then an afternoon comeback. 
12/wsj_1208:At the end of it all, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 3.69 to 2659.22.
12/wsj_1208:Yesterday's sell-off and rebound was a powerful reminder that 11 days after the 190-point plunge on Friday the 13th, the stock market still has a bad case of nerves.
12/wsj_1208:For many, it began to look like a replay of Oct. 13.
12/wsj_1208:That caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the Big Board.
12/wsj_1208:They scooped up hundreds of S&P futures when the market needed it most. 
12/wsj_1208:At about 10:40 a.m. EDT, several big buy orders hit the S&P pit simultaneously, lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer-driven program buying of stocks. 
12/wsj_1208:A UAL statement after the market closed Monday indicated that the airline's board wanted to keep the company independent, effectively crushing hopes of an immediate buy-out.
12/wsj_1208:Five minutes before the Big Board opened, a preliminary price was flashed for UAL -- somewhere between 135 and 155, a loss of as much as $43 a share from Monday's close. 
12/wsj_1208:Floor traders said there was a huge crowd around the Big Board specialist's post where UAL trades. "There was a seething mass of people," said one floor trader. "Then there was a big liquidation of stock" across the board, he added. 
12/wsj_1208:At 10:33, when the S&P 500 December futures contract crunched to a 12-point loss under the force of sell programs, S&P futures trading was halted and program trades on the Big Board were routed into a special computer that scans for order imbalances.
12/wsj_1208:These firms sold stock into the big morning decline, but seeing the velocity of the market's drop, held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the S&P futures hit the trading limit.
12/wsj_1208:Then they completed the other side of the trade by buying futures, which abruptly halted the stock market's decline as traders began to buy stocks. 
12/wsj_1208:From then on, the Dow industrials held at a loss of 40 to 50 points.
12/wsj_1208:Almost simultaneously, PaineWebber began a very visible buy program for dozens of stocks.
12/wsj_1208:On the comeback, Ms. Del Signore unloaded shares she has been aiming to get rid of. 
12/wsj_1208:But traders who risk money handling big blocks of stock were shaken. "This market is eating away my youth," said Chung Lew, head equity trader at Kleinwort Benson North America Inc. "Credibility sounds intangible.
12/wsj_1208:Traders attributed rallies in a number of stocks to a Japanese buy program that PaineWebber carried out as part of a shift in portfolio strategy, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. 
12/wsj_1208:Dow Jones climbed 5 3/4 to 41 on very heavy volume of 786,100 shares.
12/wsj_1208:Other airline stocks fell in response to the UAL board's decision to remain independent for now, including USAir Group, which separately reported a third-quarter loss of $1.86 a share compared with a year-ago profit.
12/wsj_1208:AMR, the parent of American Airlines, fell 1 3/4 to 68 7/8 on 2.3 million shares; Delta Air Lines lost 1 1/2 to 66, Southwest Airlines slid 3/4 to 24 1/4 and Midway Airlines dropped 1/4 to 14 7/8.
12/wsj_1208:Aluminum Co. of America dropped 1 1/2 to 70 1/4, Phelps Dodge fell 4 to 59 7/8, Asarco lost 1 3/8 to 31 3/4, Reynolds Metals slid 1 3/8 to 50 3/8, Amax dropped 1 1/8 to 21 5/8 and Cyprus Minerals skidded 2 to 26 3/4.
12/wsj_1208:Its third-quarter earnings were higher than a year ago, but fell short of expectations.
12/wsj_1208:Stocks of California-based thrifts also were hard hit.
12/wsj_1208:Dividend-related trading swelled volume in two issues: Security Pacific, which fell 7/8 to 44 1/2 and led the Big Board's most actives list on composite volume of 14.8 million shares, and Nipsco Industries, which lost 3/8 to 17 3/8 on 4.4 million shares.
12/wsj_1208:Both stocks have dividend yields of about 5% and will go ex-dividend Wednesday. 
12/wsj_1208:Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette placed the stock on its list of recommended issues.
12/wsj_1208:Georgia Gulf, another producer of commodity chemicals, advanced 2 to 49 1/2; Dallas investor Harold Simmons, who holds about 10% of its shares, said he hasn't raised his stake. 
12/wsj_1208:The company's board approved the repurchase of up to 45 million common shares, or about 26% of its shares outstanding, through the end of 1992. 
12/wsj_1209:GANNETT Co. raised its quarterly dividend 11% to 30 cents a share from 27 cents, payable Jan. 2, 1990, to shares of record Dec. 8, 1989.
12/wsj_1210:Fireman's Fund Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 85% to $7.2 million from last year's $49.1 million, or 99 cents a share, because of ravages of Hurricane Hugo and increased reserves for legal expenses. 
12/wsj_1210:Payout of preferred dividends resulted in a net loss of five cents a share in the most recent quarter.
12/wsj_1210:Impact of the Oct. 17 San Francisco earthquake, which will be recorded in the fourth quarter, isn't expected to exceed $50 million after taxes, the company added. 
12/wsj_1210:Hurricane Hugo accounted for about $36 million in pretax third-quarter losses, net of reinsurance recoveries. 
12/wsj_1210:The company said there was an additional increase in loss and loss-expense reserves of $71 million reflecting "higher than expected" development in claims legal expenses from to prior periods. 
12/wsj_1210:For the third quarter, net premiums were $742 million, up 9.6% from $677 million in last year's quarter, because of the expiration of the National Indemnity quota share reinsurance agreement. 
12/wsj_1210:Net premiums written through Sept. 30 fell 5% to $2.1 billion from $2.2 billion a year ago, because of the writing of fewer policies at flat prices, the company said. 
12/wsj_1210:Third-quarter and nine-month results don't include any provision for premium returns that could be ordered by the California Department of Insurance under Proposition 103.
12/wsj_1211:CONTROL DATA Corp. said it is offering to purchase the $154.2 million amount of its 12 3/4% senior notes due June 15, 1991, at par, plus accrued interest to the Dec. 8 purchase date.
12/wsj_1211:The Minneapolis computer systems and services concern said the offer is required under the senior note indenture as a result of Control Data's recent sale of its disk drive subsidiary, Imprimis, to Seagate Technology Inc. 
12/wsj_1212:Instead of trading like Bears and Bulls, 
12/wsj_1212:We need to get a space platform set up soon -- just in case we want to step out for a breath of fresh air. 
12/wsj_1213:Trading activity in the junk market was extremely light as dealers couldn't find enough buyers to match sellers. "While the stock market was falling, most {junk bond holders} were just watching it not knowing what to do," said Paul Suckow, director of fixed-income securities at Oppenheimer Management Corp. "It was like driving down the highway watching a wreck.
12/wsj_1213:TW is the largest franchisee of Hardee's, a fast-food restaurant, and operates several other food chains.
12/wsj_1213:Credit analysts said investors are nervous about the issue because they say the company's ability to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables, including the sale of assets and the need to mortgage property to retire some existing debt.
12/wsj_1213:Meanwhile, investors turned a cold shoulder to the Treasury's sale of $10 billion of new two-year notes yesterday. 
12/wsj_1213:"It's not too surprising that the auction was sloppy, given the volatility in the bond market because of stocks," said Robert T. McGee, a senior vice president at Tokai Bank Ltd. "People are looking past supply to lower interest rates, but they're also worried about being whipsawed by the volatility in the stock market." 
12/wsj_1213:The new two-year notes were priced with an average yield of 7.74%.
12/wsj_1213:The ratio, which reflects the number of bids the Treasury receives for each bid accepted, is used to gauge investor demand. 
12/wsj_1213:Dealers said players shied away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery, which, in fact, did happen. 
12/wsj_1213:However, Mr. Moran added that the Japanese generally have a positive view of the U.S. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline.
12/wsj_1213:He said, "Possibly, they're waiting to buy at the (quarterly) refunding" of government debt to be held next month by the Treasury. 
12/wsj_1213:A trader at a Japanese firm estimated that the Japanese purchased no more than 10% of the two-year notes. 
12/wsj_1213:Today investors will focus on the long-awaited auction of $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds by Resolution Funding Corp. 
12/wsj_1213:A small yield premium over comparable Treasurys and a lack of liquidity is hampering dealers' efforts to drum up interest in the so-called bailout bonds.
12/wsj_1213:The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.52% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.75%, while the rate on six-month Treasury bills was quoted at 7.47% for a yield of 7.85%. 
12/wsj_1213:Several blue-chip companies tapped the new-issue market yesterday to take advantage of falling interest rates. 
12/wsj_1213:Three of the largest offerings, by Exxon Capital Corp., Xerox Corp. and Citicorp, were underwritten by groups led by Salomon Brothers Inc. Exxon Capital, long-rumored to be a potential debt issuer, offered $200 million of 10-year notes priced to yield 8.31%.
12/wsj_1213:Citicorp issued $200 million of seven-year notes priced to yield 8.82%, and Xerox priced $150 million of six-year notes to yield 8.85%. 
12/wsj_1213:Actively traded municipal bonds ended 1/4 to 1/2 point higher in brisk trading, despite a flood of new supply. 
12/wsj_1213:New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 finished 1/4 point stronger at 98 1/2 bid, to yield 7.32%. 
12/wsj_1213:Among the new issues was Massachusetts's $230 million of general obligation bonds.
12/wsj_1213:The bonds were won by a Goldman, Sachs & Co. group with a true interest cost of 7.17%.
12/wsj_1213:The Massachusetts deal had an unsold balance of $84.3 million in late trading, the underwriter said. 
12/wsj_1213:The Ginnie Mae issue rose amid talk of large purchases of the securities by institutional investors. 
12/wsj_1213:In the asset-backed market, a big offering of Ford Motor Credit Corp. auto-loan securities was increased in size after strong institutional demand.
12/wsj_1213:Among major pass-through issues, Ginnie Mae 9% securities for November delivery ended at 98 15/32, up 5/32, after touching an early high of 98 27/32; 8% securities were at 94 5/32, up 9/32; 9 1/2% securities at 100 15/32, up 4/32; and 10% securities at 102 11/32, up 3/32.
12/wsj_1213:Prices of European government bonds also rose as U.S. stocks declined. 
12/wsj_1214:It is payable Dec. 10 to stock of record Nov. 24.
12/wsj_1214:The move was made because of the bank-holding company's increased profitability, officials said.
12/wsj_1215:The company's latest announcement said Mr. Waggoner will remain a director of Staar, a maker of products for small-incision surgery.

12/wsj_1216:After the legislature confirmed him as the Communist Party leader, Krenz said demonstrations to demand democratic freedoms could cause a "worsening of the situation, or confrontation." He also reaffirmed East Germany's allegiance to Communist orthodoxy.

12/wsj_1218:Prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects as early as the sixth week of pregnancy is increasingly common today.
12/wsj_1218:Three days later, before the new embryo had become implanted in the uterus, it was washed out of the mother mouse.
12/wsj_1218:The embryo had progressed only to a clump of eight identical cells.
12/wsj_1218:Using the new technique developed by Cetus Corp., called the polymerase chain reaction, the scientists rapidly made millions of copies of the section of DNA that ordinarily contains the hemoglobin gene, providing enough copies to test.
12/wsj_1218:In the report, two molecular biologists suggest such embryo diagnosis can be used by couples at high risk of passing a genetic defect to a child. 
12/wsj_1218:AN OIL COMPANY finds a sideline in the microscopic world of yeast. 
12/wsj_1218:But the yeast genetic apparatus is more like that of animals than the bacterial genetic apparatus.

12/wsj_1218:VISUALIZING BLOOD vessels without poking catheters into the body may come out of research at AT&T Bell Laboratories. 
12/wsj_1218:Strokes, heart attacks, leg pains (intermittent claudication) and other problems stem from clogging of the arteries by cholesterol-rich deposits.
12/wsj_1218:It's the same phenomenon used in the new MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanners being used in hospitals in place of X-ray scans. 
12/wsj_1218:In the Bell Labs experiments, an MRI-type of machine, synchronized with the heartbeat via an electrocardiogram, rapidly flashes a magnetic field on and off as blood passes a certain point in a vessel.
12/wsj_1218:The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a "stop-motion" movie of the blood-filled vessel, (like the "stop-motion" seen in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing). 
12/wsj_1218:The scientists have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats.
12/wsj_1218:They've been able to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart raises and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood, a first for such tiny blood vessels, they report in Nature, a scientific journal.
12/wsj_1218:TESTS ON 2,800-year-old mummies from Chile indicate ancient wood fires didn't produce dioxins or dibenzofurans, contradicting a theory the two pollutants today are coming from wood burning, General Electric Co. reports in Environmental Science & Technology magazine. . . .

12/wsj_1220:Lloyd's of London said it plans to clamp down on the ability of underwriting syndicates to leave their annual accounts open beyond the customary three years. 
12/wsj_1220:Underwriting syndicates at Lloyd's, the world's largest insurance market, generally don't close their accounts for three years, to allow for the filing of claims and litigation.
12/wsj_1220:Lloyd's said there are currently 115 open account years involving 68 of the market's roughly 360 syndicates. 
12/wsj_1220:The open-year accounting practice "is widely recognized within Lloyd's as of serious concern" to the 31,329 member investors, who underwrite insurance at Lloyd's in return for premium and investment income, Lloyd's said.
12/wsj_1220:The procedure causes "great uncertainty" because an investor can't be sure of his or her individual liability, Lloyd's said. 
12/wsj_1220:As a result, the insurance market plans new measures to restrict the ability of syndicate officials to leave years open.
12/wsj_1220:Under the new rules, the officials will have to secure additional information and reports from actuaries, including an assessment of whether officials have acted reasonably.
12/wsj_1221:Computer Associates International Inc. reported earnings for the second quarter, ended Sept. 30, plummeted 66%, primarily because of the acquisition of Cullinet Software Inc. 
12/wsj_1221:Anthony Wang, president, attributed the drop to the disruption of the company's business resulting from the prolonged process of acquiring Cullinet.
12/wsj_1221:The delays mainly affected sales of data base management products, a core area for both Computer Associates and Cullinet, as well as sales of other products as part of package sales. 
12/wsj_1222:Residents of this city soon will be seeing ads urging them to visit "Cleveland's outdoor museum" -- Lake View Cemetery. 
12/wsj_1222:The ads celebrate the achievements of some of Lake View's residents.
12/wsj_1222:A spot honoring Bill White, the inventor of chewing gum, shows a woman trying to extricate her high-heeled shoe from a wad of gum. 
12/wsj_1222:Street lights, the ad points out, "helped sharpen the arm of many a budding baseball player." 
12/wsj_1222:Lake View had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as an out-of-repair and crime-infested cemetery. 
12/wsj_1222:The private, non-profit cemetery has had trouble competing against its for-profit counterparts, which use direct mail and other advertising to sell lots. "We don't want to be known as ambulance chasers," says William Garrison, Lake View's president. "We want people to think of Lake View as an historical park and educational experience. . . . A pleasant place to come and spend a few hours." 
12/wsj_1222:Not all of the cemetery's better-known tenants lend themselves to the promotional job at hand, however.
12/wsj_1222:For example, President James A. Garfield is entombed here, the victim of an assassination in 1881. (Mr.
12/wsj_1222:Garrison notes, however, that the Garfield tomb is one of the nation's premier examples of Romanesque architecture.) 
12/wsj_1222:But there are plenty of other promising prospects at Lake View, promoters believe: Ernest Ball, for instance, who wrote "When Irish Eyes are Smiling," and Garrett Morgan, the inventor of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light. 
12/wsj_1223:Euro Disneyland shares made a debut like Snow White yesterday while most of the London stock market looked like it had eaten the Evil Queen's poisoned apple. 
12/wsj_1223:In its first day of when-issued trading here, Euro Disney soared like Dumbo to close at 814 pence ($13.05), up 15% from its 707-pence offering price.
12/wsj_1223:Traders credited Euro Disney's share performance to the tremendous hyping of the project that the shares are destined to help finance: Walt Disney Co. 's 4,800-acre theme park 20 miles east of Paris.
12/wsj_1223:"The issue was very well-received -- Disney is such a well-known, you can say world-wide, name," said Vernon Dempsey, head trader of European equities at Kleinwort Benson Ltd., which is making a market in the issue. 
12/wsj_1223:Mr. Dempsey estimated that the issue's London debut was accompanied by "very, very heavy turnover -- between five million and six million shares." Most of the buying was institutional, he added. 
12/wsj_1223:Official trading in the shares will start in London, Paris and Brussels on Nov. 6, when the French-franc denominated offering, valued at the equivalent of nearly $1 billion, comes to market in the European Community.
12/wsj_1223:Because of the interest connected with the issue, the London exchange took the unusual step of letting traders establish an officially sanctioned when-issued market. 
12/wsj_1223:"A lot of people are getting hurt on this wicked whipsawing," cautioned Alistair Cuddeford, a London-based Salomon Brothers International Ltd. trader who makes a market in franc-denominated Euro Disney shares. "There should be no great rush for investors to buy this.
12/wsj_1223:A lot of big European banks, mostly French, and Swiss arb accounts have been buying the stock just to flip it" for a quick profit, he said. 
12/wsj_1224:Albert Fried Jr., a 59-year-old director and holder of a 9.5% stake in the company, was named chairman of this maker of products for the construction equipment, material handling and railroad industries.
12/wsj_1224:Mr. Fried also is the managing partner of Albert Fried & Co. 
12/wsj_1225:Ford Motor Co. intensified its battle with General Motors Corp. over Jaguar PLC by saying it is prepared to make a bid for all of the British auto maker when restrictions on its shareholding are lifted. 
12/wsj_1225:The statement was part of a Ford filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
12/wsj_1225:The British government currently forbids any outside investor from holding more than 15% of the company's shares without permission until Dec. 31, 
12/wsj_1225:He emphasized that the car maker only would bid for all of Jaguar under the right circumstances, and said "those circumstances aren't right or possible at the moment." 
12/wsj_1225:Last month, Ford announced plans to acquire as much as 15% of Jaguar.
12/wsj_1225:Analysts have been expecting a GM-Jaguar pact that would give the U.S. car maker an eventual 30% stake in the British company and create joint ventures that would produce an executive-model range of cars.
12/wsj_1225:But the specter of Ford eventually launching a full-fledged bid could unravel the GM-Jaguar talks. 
12/wsj_1225:Jaguar seems to be losing interest in giving GM a minority stake, said one individual close to the talks, adding, "It wouldn't surprise me if {Jaguar executives} want to wait and see what the color of that {Ford bid} is" first.
12/wsj_1225:A Ford takeover of Jaguar would "have such implications for the balance of power in the 1990s that General Motors can't afford to step aside.
12/wsj_1225:The prospect of such a takeover fight has sent Jaguar shares soaring in recent weeks.
12/wsj_1225:U.S. takeover-stock speculators now own an estimated 25% of Jaguar shares.
12/wsj_1225:Ford's need to acquire some or all of Jaguar became more acute last week when it abandoned a four-year effort to market its German-built Merkur Scorpio sedan as a European luxury import in the U.S. Then, last Friday, Ford's talks about a possible alliance with Saab-Scania AB of Sweden collapsed. 
12/wsj_1225:GM's interest in Jaguar reflects a desire to help diversify the U.S. company's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market.
12/wsj_1225:Its Opel line has a solid image and a recent string of highly successful new models, but it lacks Jaguar's cachet.
12/wsj_1225:GM officials also see a lot of potential in marrying Jaguar's cars to the technological know-how of Group Lotus PLC, a British engineering and specialty car maker GM bought in 1986. 
12/wsj_1226:Texaco's exploration and production earnings improved as a result of its streamlining of those operations as it sold many of its marginal producing properties over the past 18 months.
12/wsj_1226:The sale of a portion of refining and marketing operations to Saudi Arabia helped alleviate the decline in earnings from that business. 
12/wsj_1226:Per-share earnings declined to $1.10 a share from $1.12 a share, largely because of 21 million additional shares issued to retire $1 billion of debt.
12/wsj_1226:Per-share earnings also shrank because of dividends on a new series of preferred stock. 
12/wsj_1226:Sun said some of the growth reflects higher earnings in the oil sands operation of Suncor, a majority-owned Canadian subsidiary.
12/wsj_1226:Overseas exploration and production results also improved because of additional output from the North Sea Magnus Field, a portion of which was acquired by Sun earlier this year.
12/wsj_1226:Profits of Shell, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, tumbled $24 million, or 6.6%, to $340 million, despite a gain of $30 million from an insurance settlement.
12/wsj_1226:President Frank Richardson attributed the decline to lower natural gas prices, which countered higher earnings from the crude oil sector of Shell's exploration and production operation.
12/wsj_1226:Shaving away some of the gain in that unit was a decline in U.S. oil production to 502,000 barrels of oil a day during the quarter from 527,000 barrels a day last year. 
12/wsj_1226:Earnings included a one-time gain of $192 million on a property transaction in Hong Kong.
12/wsj_1226:The restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will involve the transfer and layoff of employees in U.S. operations to reduce costs and focus efforts in other areas. 
12/wsj_1226:Last year, third-quarter earnings included a $157 million gain from foreign tax rate changes and a loss from a $65 million write-off of reserves. 
12/wsj_1226:Results included a $37 million gain from the sale of rights from Chevron's investment in Amax Inc., and a loss of $30 million from the sale of California oil and gas properties.
12/wsj_1226:Refining and marketing operations earned $130 million in the quarter this year, compared with earnings of $186 million a year earlier that included $18 million in charges for environmental programs.
12/wsj_1227:The mining, metal and specialty-chemical concern said combined revenue for asbestos and coal was about $40 million of the company's total revenue in 1988 of $1.98 billion.
12/wsj_1227:Richard de J. Osborne, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the company's "decisions to get out of asbestos and high-sulfur coal continue the process of simplifying and focusing the company in areas with a better future." 
12/wsj_1227:The company said that it is discussing a management-employee buy-out of the facility, but that it would stop mining and selling coal at year end when existing sales contracts expire, regardless of the outcome of those talks. 
12/wsj_1228:Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
12/wsj_1230:Mr. Salvagni, 53 years old, succeeds John C. Griffin, 57, who is retiring as corporate vice president of pharmaceutical manufacturing.
12/wsj_1230:Upjohn is a world-wide provider of health-care products and services, seeds and speciality chemicals. 
12/wsj_1231:This Brooklyn, N.Y., generic-drug maker announced a 5% stock dividend payable Dec. 15, to holders of record Nov. 15.
12/wsj_1231:As of Sept. 30, Halsey had 5.3 million common shares outstanding.
12/wsj_1231:Jay Marcus, president, said the move "reflects the confidence of our board and management in Halsey's long-term prospects and our desire to provide our shareholders with an attractive return on their investment." In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Halsey closed at $5.8125 a share, up 6.25 cents. 
12/wsj_1232:Walter M. Brady was named a senior vice president of this insurer in the Canadian head office.

12/wsj_1233:C. Barr Schuler, 49, vice president and chief financial officer, was named senior vice president of corporate development and acquisitions, a new post.
12/wsj_1233:Phillip J. Stuecker, 37, vice president, secretary and treasurer, was named vice president of finance and chief financial officer.
12/wsj_1234:Ronald B. Koenig, 55 years old, was named a senior managing director of the Gruntal & Co. brokerage subsidiary of this insurance and financial-services firm.
12/wsj_1234:Mr. Koenig will build the corporate-finance and investment-banking business of Gruntal, which has primarily been a retail-based firm.
12/wsj_1234:He was chairman and co-chief executive officer of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. until July, when he was named co-chairman of the investment-banking firm along with Howard L. Blum Jr., who then became the sole chief executive.
12/wsj_1234:Yesterday, Mr. Blum, 41, said he wasn't aware of plans at Ladenburg to name a co-chairman to succeed Mr. Koenig and said the board would need to approve any appointments or title changes.
12/wsj_1235:Woolworth said it expects to expand usage of the MCI services as it adds about 6,000 business locations over the next few years. 
12/wsj_1236:The Philippine merchandise trade deficit widened to $1.71 billion during the first eight months of 1989 from $807 million a year earlier. 
12/wsj_1236:The trade deficit in the first eight months is already wider than the trade gap of $1.09 billion for all of 1988. 
12/wsj_1237:Birtcher Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement with C.R. Bard Inc., a Murray Hill, N.J., maker of health-care products, for the purchase of the company's Bard/EMS Electrosurgery division for about $11 million. 
12/wsj_1237:Birtcher, a maker of electronic medical equipment, said the transaction is expected to close on or before Nov. 30.
12/wsj_1237:Bard/ EMS had 1988 sales of about $14 million, Birtcher said. 
12/wsj_1238:WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- First Wachovia Corp. said John F. McNair III will retire as president and chief executive officer of this regional banking company's Wachovia Corp. and Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. subsidiaries on Dec. 31. 
12/wsj_1238:Mr. McNair, 62 years old, will be succeeded by L.M. "Bud" Baker Jr., 47, the parent's chief credit officer and head of its administration division.
12/wsj_1238:In addition, on Jan. 1, Thomas A. Bennett, 52, will become vice chairman and chief operating officer of Wachovia and Wachovia Bank & Trust, filling a vacancy left by the retired Hans W. Wanders in April.

12/wsj_1241:Officials said South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. for the first nine months of the year totaled $3.49 billion, down 43% from the same period last year on a customs-clearance basis. 
12/wsj_1242:Bausch & Lomb Inc. said its pharmaceuticals subsidiary agreed to supply collagen corneal shields for animal eye surgery to a unit of International Minerals & Chemical Corp. 
12/wsj_1242:The collagen corneal shield helps speed healing of the cornea after eye surgery. 
12/wsj_1242:The product will be distributed by Pitman-Moore Inc., a subsidiary of International Minerals. 
12/wsj_1243:The state agency, which usually publishes the data on monthly basis, but traditionally combines the index for the two summer-holiday months, said the advance was led by output of consumer goods, which rose 3.5% from June and was up 7.2% from a year earlier. 
12/wsj_1243:Semifinished goods turned in a strong showing, with a monthly rise of 2% and a year-on-year advance of 3%.
12/wsj_1243:These gains were partly offset by output of cars and other consumer durables, which eased 3.9% from June's high level.
12/wsj_1244:International Minerals & Chemical Corp. said it agreed definitively to sell its international fragrance business to Bayer AG of West Germany.
12/wsj_1244:The maker of animal health and nutrition products said the business, Creations Aromatiques of Port Valais, Switzerland, and Woodside, N.Y., is a division of its Mallinckrodt Inc. subsidiary and had sales of about $30 million for its most recent year. 
12/wsj_1244:International Minerals said the sale will allow Mallinckrodt to focus its resources on its core businesses of medical products, specialty chemicals and flavors. 
12/wsj_1246:The drug AZT, the only treatment currently on the market, claims only to help stop the spread of AIDS, not to cure it. 
12/wsj_1246:But several analysts and Japanese scientists familiar with the study, which was announced at a conference in Nagoya yesterday, expressed skepticism over the significance of the results.
12/wsj_1246:Shin Yonehara, a research scientist at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, said the antibody he discovered works by recognizing an antigen called a Fas-antigen, which is characteristic of an infected cell.
12/wsj_1246:Dr. Yonehara and his partner, Nobuyuki Kobayashi of Yamaguchi University, said their experiments showed that the antibody wiped out an average of 60% of AIDS-infected cells within three days.
12/wsj_1246:In some of the experiments, it killed almost all the infected cells, the researchers said.
12/wsj_1246:Meanwhile, fewer than 10% of the healthy cells were killed. 
12/wsj_1246:But Takashi Kitamura, director of the biology department at Japan's National Institute of Health and secretary of the government's AIDS-research center, said, "I'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods." He said some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so wouldn't be killed even after exposure to the antibody. 
12/wsj_1246:"The results seem to be very premature," said Mitsuru Miyata, editor of Nikkei Biotechnology, a leading Japanese industry newsletter. 
12/wsj_1246:But he and Dr. Yonehara said there were still several uncertainties, particularly regarding possible side effects. "Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose, but it can also kill other cells," said Dr. Yonehara. "We don't know the effect of our antibody on the human body." 
12/wsj_1246:AIDS isn't considered a widespread problem in Japan -- the government reports about 1,000 known carriers of the virus -- but many companies have poured substantial resources into research in recent years, hoping to cash in on a possible cure. 
12/wsj_1246:A Wellcome spokesman declined to comment on the discovery of the antibody in Japan.
12/wsj_1246:But Andrew Porter, a drug-industry analyst at Nikko Securities Co. in London, said if the product were to be successfully developed it would represent "a potential threat to the long-term viability of Retrovir."

12/wsj_1248:A #320 million ($508 million) British Airways PLC rights issue flopped badly -- the victim of recent market turbulence and the collapse of the buy-out bid for United Airlines' parent, UAL Corp. 
12/wsj_1248:The United Kingdom carrier had planned the issue to help finance its $750 million purchase of a 15% stake in UAL.
12/wsj_1248:British Airways said its shareholders accepted only 6.3% of the convertible capital bonds, but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters.
12/wsj_1248:In a statement, British Air Chairman Lord King said the company was "obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up, but it would have been unreasonable to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue." 
12/wsj_1248:Underwriters led by Lazard Brothers & Co. will pick up the rest of the airline's offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common shares.
12/wsj_1248:And instead of buying the UAL stake, the U.K. carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war chest. "From a cash flow point of view, British Airways is better off not being in United Airlines in the short term," said Andy Chambers, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London.
12/wsj_1248:For instance, British Air is continuing to negotiate with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines about each acquiring a 20% stake in Sabena World Airlines, the air transport subsidiary of the Belgian national airline.
12/wsj_1248:A definitive agreement had been expected by the end of July. 
12/wsj_1248:Some analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split, which may lead to the resignation of Sir Colin Marshall, the carrier's chief executive officer. "The stories are rubbish," a British Air spokesman said. "There is no difference of opinion between (Chairman) Lord King and Sir Colin on any aspect of company policy." 
12/wsj_1249:Six months ago, as some personnel specialists saw it, a perception that President Bush really cared about fair employment -- after what they said was eight years of Reagan-era neglect -- was prodding top management to raise hiring goals for females, blacks and other minorities.
12/wsj_1249:But so far, he declares, there's little evidence the "new urgency" is trickling down to the managers who actually do hiring. "Is there really a commitment or an illusion of activity?" he asks. 
12/wsj_1249:But some of the activity, he says, may reflect a rush to get "numbers in order" for end-of-year reports. 
12/wsj_1249:Du Pont Co. in a couple of units has installed objective tests based on earnings or return on equity.
12/wsj_1249:University of Michigan researchers find the companies earn more and win a bigger market share when their American employees get a voice in planning, product development and design, including decision-making back in Japan. "You can't hire competent Americans and say, `Let them run only their own show, '" says Vladimir Pucik, who headed the study run with Egon Zehnder International, a search firm. 
12/wsj_1249:The researchers say many Japanese companies err in the U.S. by adopting the American practice of hiring managers on the "open market." In Japan, by contrast, companies tend to develop their own talent and promote from within.
12/wsj_1249:The Japanese also are accused of keeping their cards too close to their vests. "Some Japanese executives are not yet . . . comfortable about sharing strategic information with their American colleagues," the researchers say. 
12/wsj_1249:THE HOUSE votes down a proposal to put pension plans under the control of joint labor-management boards.
12/wsj_1249:More than half the people surveyed for the Employee Benefit Research Institute say they would be willing and able to pick up most of the cost of the coverage. 
12/wsj_1249:FRINGE-BENEFIT spending by small and medium-sized employers has dropped to 25% of payroll from 29% three years ago, says the National Institute of Business Management, an advisory service. 
12/wsj_1249:FEAR OF AIDS hinders hiring at few hospitals.
12/wsj_1249:She was the only staff physician available to treat AIDS patients last summer and now she has the help of only two doctors part time.
12/wsj_1249:Part of the problem, though, may reflect a general unwillingness to work with the urban poor. 
12/wsj_1249:St. Paul Medical Center, also in Dallas, sees only a "minimal erosion" of support staff due to AIDS. Yale-New Haven Hospital sees no problem, says John Fenn, the chief of staff. 
12/wsj_1249:The Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms says the industry's volume has soared tenfold since 1980, to $350 million a year. . . . And somebody loses on the expected repeal of Section 89, the benefits test fought by most employers.

12/wsj_1250:The left-of-center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results. 
12/wsj_1250:Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric, the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin, Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia. 
12/wsj_1250:With West German unemployment remaining high at two million jobless and the lack of affordable housing becoming a primary issue for next year's campaign, the Republicans are seen drawing support for their "Germans First" stand on social-welfare issues. 
12/wsj_1250:Election analysts acknowledge that a "Red-Green" coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could edge out Chancellor Kohl's coalition in the December 1990 national election if support for the Republicans continues to spread. 
12/wsj_1250:International investigators urged Britain to allow prosecution of suspected Nazi war criminals who took refuge there after 1945.
12/wsj_1250:"If we're not careful we could become known as a haven for war criminals," said Jeff Rooker, a member of Parliament and one of several British politicians attending a London conference with government investigators from the U.S., Canada and Australia. 
12/wsj_1250:A parliamentary inquiry found in July that more than 70 people living in Britain could have been part of death squads that roamed Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe.
12/wsj_1250:British investigations were prompted by a list of 17 alleged war criminals living in Britain sent to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in October 1986 by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. 
12/wsj_1250:In a sign of easing tension between Beijing and Hong Kong, China said it will again take back illegal immigrants caught crossing into the British colony.
12/wsj_1250:Although Italy's investigation of whether Olivetti had violated Western export-control rules had previously been made known, this marked the first time the unit and product were named.
12/wsj_1250:The U.S. is worried about the convertibility of Olivetti's machine tools to military use.
12/wsj_1250:However, an Olivetti spokeswoman said OCN-PPL, of which Olivetti sold the majority interest last year, "doesn't make equipment that has the type of precision necessary for sophisticated productions." 
12/wsj_1250:Conservationists say that drift-net fishing threatens to wipe out much of the world's tuna stocks in a few years.
12/wsj_1250:In driftnet, or "wall of death," fishing, fleets lay nets up to three miles long that trap almost everything in their path.
12/wsj_1250:Earlier this year, Japan said it would cut the number of its drift-net vessels in the South Pacific by two-thirds, or down to 20. 
12/wsj_1250:Workers at Peugeot S.A.'s car plant at Sochaux, in eastern France, voted to end a six-week-old strike that has cost the Peugeot group production of 60,000 automobiles, a company spokesman said.
12/wsj_1250:The strikers voted to accept a series of management proposals that will give them a higher basic wage, better profit-sharing benefits and bigger annual bonuses.
12/wsj_1250:The spokesman said the vote at Sochaux is expected to be followed by a similar move at the company's assembly plant at Mulhouse, where the number of strikers has been whittled down to 80. 
12/wsj_1250:About 8,000 National Union of Mineworkers members resumed their strike against De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. after further negotiations to settle a wage dispute broke down.
12/wsj_1250:China's People's Daily took note of the growing problem of computer fraud. 
12/wsj_1250:Since the first fraud was discovered in July 1986 at an office of the People's Bank of China in Shenzhen, 15 major cases have been found, the paper said; the biggest was the theft of $235,000 from a bank in Chengdu in March 1988. 
12/wsj_1250:The number of computers has mushroomed in recent years, with 10,000 in use, as well as 30,000 miniature models.

12/wsj_1251:Fatalities on rural interstates rose 33% between 1986 and last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a report on the impact of the 65 miles-per-hour speed limit on those roads. 
12/wsj_1251:"About one-third of the fatality increase is attributed to greater travel, and about two-thirds is attributed to other factors {primarily to greater speed}," according to NHTSA.

12/wsj_1253:In an Oct. 10 editorial-page article, "It's the World Bank's Turn to Adjust," Paul Craig Roberts lays most of the blame for what ails developing countries at the doorstep of the World Bank.
12/wsj_1253:One of Mr. Roberts's observations is that the Bank's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries.
12/wsj_1253:As of June 30, 1989 -- the day our past fiscal year came to a close -- only 4.1% of the Bank's portfolio was affected by arrears of over six months.
12/wsj_1253:Because of the business-like manner in which the Bank goes about development, financial markets have confidence in it.
12/wsj_1253:Another of Mr. Roberts's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good "by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development." Here, too, Mr. Roberts is way off the mark.
12/wsj_1253:Our traditional project loans have, for instance, supported sensible energy pricing in the power sector, sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient, autonomous agencies.
12/wsj_1253:In my home region, Latin America, much of the existing infrastructure base -- an important building block for development -- has been financed by the World Bank. 
12/wsj_1253:What are the facts on this type of lending?
12/wsj_1253:Typically, these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy, to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector. 
12/wsj_1253:Support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the Bank's.
12/wsj_1253:These are not the actions of a development agency wed to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government, as Mr. Roberts alleges.
12/wsj_1254:The agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products, maintaining production of the two most important ones, corn and milk.
12/wsj_1254:Mr. Ovalle also said Conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods. 
12/wsj_1254:Business leaders have long criticized the agency as a leading example of bureacratic waste. 
12/wsj_1255:The Food and Drug Administration banned all imports of mushrooms from China in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms. 
12/wsj_1255:The outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables.
12/wsj_1255:A recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early March. 
12/wsj_1255:In 1987, China exported 65 million pounds of mushrooms, valued at $47 million, to the U.S.
12/wsj_1256:The FBI is very supportive of and an active participant in Mr. Bennett's initiative.
12/wsj_1256:It was agreed at the outset of the Washington Drug Initiative that the FBI's role would be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our National Drug Strategy.
12/wsj_1256:Through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user, but rather we target and attack major drug-trafficking organizations that control a large segment of the drug market.
12/wsj_1256:The trial of Raful Edmond III in Washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). 
12/wsj_1256:The FBI's role is to complement the D.C. initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations, but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police squads handling drug-related crimes.
12/wsj_1256:In fact, we have agents assigned full time to assist the MPD in drug-related crimes such as homicide and other crimes of violence.

12/wsj_1257:Ramada Inc. revised the terms of its restructuring and extended to Feb. 28, 1990, the deadline to complete the sale of its hotel business to New World Development Co. of Hong Kong and Prime Motor Inns Inc. of Fairfield, N.J. 
12/wsj_1257:Ramada's previous plan was derailed by upheaval in the junk-bond market that hindered the offering of $400 million in high-yield securities of Aztar Corp., the new company that will operate Ramada's casinos in Nevada and Atlantic City, 
12/wsj_1257:Revised terms call for each Ramada common share to be exchanged for $1 in cash, subject to possible reduction, and one share of Aztar common stock.
12/wsj_1257:Shareholders will also receive one cent per share for the redemption of preferred stock purchase rights. 
12/wsj_1257:The cash payout will be reduced by 40% of any amount by which the weighted mean price of Ramada's common stock exceeds $14 on the day the transaction closes.
12/wsj_1257:One major advantage of the revised plan is that Aztar will have far less debt than under the old terms. "They'll go from being one of the most leveraged to one of the least leveraged casino companies," said Daniel Lee, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Mr. Lee values the package at between $15 and $20 a share, based on current trading prices of other casino-company stocks. 
12/wsj_1257:In May, Ramada sold its Marie Callender Pie Shops Inc. unit to a group of private investors as part of its plan to focus on its casinos in Atlantic City and in Las Vegas and Laughlin, Nev. 
12/wsj_1258:Traders and analysts said the divergence between the stock and bond markets is a sign of growing unease about the economic outlook.
12/wsj_1258:That unease is expected to grow today when the government reports on September durable goods orders and again Thursday when the first assessment of third-quarter economic growth is released.
12/wsj_1258:The stock market's decline, coming after a record weekly gain of 119.88 points, surprised some investors.
12/wsj_1258:But A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research, said last week's rally was a reflex reaction to the Oct. 13 stock market rout.
12/wsj_1258:Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers, 1,012 to 501. 
12/wsj_1259:The Wall Street Journal "American Way of Buying" Survey consists of two separate, door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization.
12/wsj_1259:Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data. 
12/wsj_1259:For each poll, the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the U.S. using the same questionnaire, the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1/2 percentage points in either direction.
12/wsj_1259:The margin of error for subgroups -- for example, married women with children at home -- would be larger.

12/wsj_1260:Even if Mr. Crandall is correct, he of all people must realize our society relies on competition to keep prices at a competitive level.
12/wsj_1260:In 1986, he settled an antitrust suit based on a taped telephone conversation of him proposing to Braniff's president that they both raise fares 20%. (Braniff declined).
12/wsj_1260:When I asked American Airlines for its side of the story for use in my MBA class, where I teach business ethics, it did not respond.

12/wsj_1261:Earlier this year, Meredith sold its first such package for $3 million to Kraft Inc., now a unit of New York-based Philip Morris Cos.
12/wsj_1261:Bill Murphy, director of the new marketing unit, said Meredith is negotiating other large-scale packages with leading companies in several product categories, but he wouldn't disclose their names.
12/wsj_1261:Paul DuCharme, director of media services at Grey Advertising, said Meredith is the leader in providing multimedia packages. "They may get passed up later when other publishers get their acts together, but for now they are the quickest offering the most extensive plan," he said. 
12/wsj_1261:Mr. Murphy of Meredith said one advertiser, which he wouldn't identify, wants Meredith to provide ad pages in seven Meredith magazines, publish an interior-decorating book that will be distributed at point of purchase, give away a videotape on installation pointers, and possibly use Meredith's Better Homes and Gardens' residential real-estate agents to distribute discount-coupon books to new homeowners. 
12/wsj_1262:I've been advising small businesses many years and have lived with the fact that 50% will go out of business within two years, and 80% in five years. 
12/wsj_1262:And most of these are absolutely unnecessary.
12/wsj_1262:Your article points out the traps people fall into, but when reviewing those traps one sees just about all of them could have been avoided.
12/wsj_1262:There is a more descriptive word to describe his lapse of common sense. 
12/wsj_1262:His humility gives him a much better chance of success.

12/wsj_1263:The management turnover at Reebok International Ltd. continued with the resignation of company president C. Joseph LaBonte, who joined Reebok just two years ago. 
12/wsj_1263:Mr. LaBonte's departure follows by two months the resignation of Mark Goldston as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only 11 months at Reebok. 
12/wsj_1263:The two executives are among a number of outsiders recruited by Reebok in the past few years to help it make the transition from a small start-up company to a marketing giant with sales last year of $1.79 billion. 
12/wsj_1263:The changes come as Reebok, which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales flatten of late, is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic-shoe business against rivals Nike Inc. and L.A. Gear Inc. 
12/wsj_1263:The departures, said Alice Ruth, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, should enable the company to focus on business issues instead of management differences. "I think it's more an issue of style.
12/wsj_1263:They're in the midst of a turnaround," she noted. 
12/wsj_1263:Reebok said Mr. LaBonte will resume the presidency of Vantage Group Inc., a California-based venture capital firm that he founded in 1983.
12/wsj_1263:Before that he was president and chief operating officer of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. Reebok added that Mr. Fireman will assume the title of president. 
12/wsj_1263:Mr. Goldston, who had been president of Faberge Inc. 's Faberge U.S.A. division before joining Reebok in September 1988, left in August to pursue other interests. 
12/wsj_1264:Magazine publishers are facing spiraling costs and a glut of new titles.
12/wsj_1264:But even a raft of recent failures isn't stopping them from launching new publications. 
12/wsj_1264:New York-based Hearst Corp. this fall plans to publish its first issue of 9 Months, a magazine for expectant mothers, and has already launched American Home.
12/wsj_1264:And Time Warner Inc. is developing a spinoff of Time magazine aimed at kids, on the heels of its successful Sports Illustrated for Kids. 
12/wsj_1264:Over the past four years, the number of consumer magazines has increased by an average of 80 magazines annually, according to Donald Kummerfeld, president of the Magazine Publishers of America. "This is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry," said Mr. Kummerfeld. "Entrepreneurs don't rush to get into a stagnant or declining industry." 
12/wsj_1264:Within the same nine months, News Corp. closed down In Fashion, a once-promising young woman's fashion magazine, Drake Publications Inc. has folded the long-troubled Venture magazine, and Lang Communications has announced Ms. magazine, after 17 years, will no longer carry advertising as of January.
12/wsj_1264:Meanwhile, American Health Partners, publisher of American Health magazine, is deep in debt, and Owen Lipstein, founder and managing partner, is being forced to sell the magazine to Reader's Digest Association Inc. Mr. Lipstein's absence from the meeting here raised speculation that the sale is in trouble.
12/wsj_1264:"Magazines can no longer be considered institutions," said James Autry, president of Meredith Corp. 's magazine group. "Publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die," he added. "Magazines could, like other brands, find that they have only a limited life." 
12/wsj_1264:There are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs, traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky start-ups, are dwindling.
12/wsj_1264:More than ever, independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups, such as American Express Publishing Corp., a unit of American Express Co., and Conde Nast Publications Inc., a unit of Advance Publications Inc., which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers. 
12/wsj_1264:Gerry Ritterman, president of New York-based Network Publishing Corp., earlier this year sold his Soap Opera Digest magazine to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Mr. Ritterman said that in the next six months he will take $50 million from the Soap Opera Digest sale to acquire new magazines.
12/wsj_1265:MCA Inc. said its toy-making unit agreed to buy Buddy L Corp., producer of a line of toy vehicles and preschool products. 
12/wsj_1265:The price wasn't disclosed, but an executive of LJN Toys Ltd., the MCA unit, said the closely held Buddy L had annual sales in excess of $20 million.
12/wsj_1266:(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 
12/wsj_1266:Within six years many figures were convicted for their illegal abuse of Franklin funds.
12/wsj_1266:In June 1980, Michele Sindona -- an Italian financier who in July 1972 had bought a 22% block of Franklin's stock from Loews Corp., headed by Laurence A. Tisch -- was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and perjury.
12/wsj_1266:Included was the charge that Sindona siphoned $45 million of Franklin funds for his other ventures. (Sindona in 1979 faked his "kidnapping" for 2 1/2 months to delay his trial.) 
12/wsj_1266:During 1976 to 1979, other former Franklin officials either pleaded guilty to or were found guilty of violations including phony transactions to hide the bank's losses. 
12/wsj_1267:In a nondescript office building south of Los Angeles, human behavior is being monitored, dissected and, ultimately, manipulated. 
12/wsj_1267:Agreement, disapproval, boredom and distraction all can be inferred from the subjects' twist of a dial.
12/wsj_1267:In the process, Litigation Sciences is quietly but inexorably reshaping the world of law. 
12/wsj_1267:Little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within, Litigation Sciences, a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi PLC, employs more than 100 psychologists, sociologists, marketers, graphic artists and technicians.
12/wsj_1267:Twenty-one of its workers are Ph.
12/wsj_1267:Among other services, the firm provides pre-trial opinion polls, creates profiles of "ideal" jurors, sets up mock trials and "shadow" juries, coaches lawyers and witnesses, and designs courtroom graphics. 
12/wsj_1267:It advised the National Football League in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the United States Football League.
12/wsj_1267:And it helped win defense verdicts in product-liability suits involving scores of products, ranging from Firestone 500 tires to the anti-nausea drug Bendectin.
12/wsj_1267:Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen.
12/wsj_1267:In the film classic "Twelve Angry Men," the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror's bias and purges it from playing a role in the verdict.
12/wsj_1267:After hours of conflict and debate, that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity.
12/wsj_1267:Others complain that the consultants' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services. "The affluent people and the corporations can buy it, the poor radicals {in political cases} get it free, and everybody in between is at a disadvantage, and that's not the kind of system we want," says Amitai Etzioni, a prominent sociologist who teaches at George Washington University. 
12/wsj_1267:Sophisticated trial consulting grew, ironically, from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases.
12/wsj_1267:In that case, a group of left-leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around Harrisburg.
12/wsj_1267:"The hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and, in some sense, your ignorance," says Mr. Boies of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. "What you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it.
12/wsj_1267:The approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which Energy Transportation Systems Inc. sued Santa Fe Pacific Corp. over the transport of semi-liquefied coal -- the kind of case likely to make almost anyone's eyes glaze over. 
12/wsj_1267:Energy Transportation retained Litigation Sciences, at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars, to poll, pre-try, profile and shadow.
12/wsj_1267:Just before the actual closing arguments, the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors, each of whom was being paid $150 a day.
12/wsj_1267:"It's just like weather forecasting," says Energy Transportation trial attorney Harry Reasoner of Vinson & Elkins. "It's often wrong, but it's better than consulting an Indian rain dancer." 
12/wsj_1267:Forecasting is only one part of Litigation Sciences' work.
12/wsj_1267:Changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters.
12/wsj_1267:And to the uninitiated, some of the firm's approaches may seem chillingly manipulative. 
12/wsj_1267:Instead, Mr. Vinson says, interviews with thousands of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to shoe-horn the facts of the case to fit their views. 
12/wsj_1267:Pre-trial polling helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of juror.
12/wsj_1267:In our system of advocacy, the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can." 
12/wsj_1267:In one personal-injury case, a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool, but the fall didn't explain why one of her arms was discolored bluish.
12/wsj_1267:By repeatedly drawing the jury's attention to the arm, the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman's injuries.
12/wsj_1267:In a classic defense of a personal-injury case, the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame. "The ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight," Mr. Vinson has written. 
12/wsj_1267:Computer-generated videos help. "The average American watches seven hours of TV a day.
12/wsj_1267:Litigation consulting isn't a guarantee of a favorable outcome.
12/wsj_1267:A few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched by consultants or of overpriced services -- as when one lawyer paid a consultant (not at Litigation Sciences) $70,000 to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in The American Lawyer magazine. 
12/wsj_1267:Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick. "The essence of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation," says Barry Ostrager of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co.
12/wsj_1267:For more than a decade, Mr. Etzioni, the sociologist, has been a leading critic of the masseurs. "There's no reason to believe that juries rule inappropriately," he says. "But the last thing you want to do is manipulate the subconscious to make them think better.
12/wsj_1267:To hamper the work of litigation scientists, he suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove from the jury panel through so-called peremptory challenges -- exclusions that don't require explanations.
12/wsj_1267:Mr. Boies, the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson's services, cautions against courts' allowing extensive jury questioning (known as voir dire) or giving out personal information about the jurors. "The more extensive the voir dire, the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective, and I don't think courts should lend themselves to that," Mr. Boies says. 
12/wsj_1268:Silicon Graphics Inc., a fast-growing maker of computer workstations, said it landed two federal government contracts worth more than $100 million over the next five years. 
12/wsj_1268:One award is part of a Department of Defense contract to Loral Rolm Mil-Spec Computers and could be valued at more than $100 million over five years.
12/wsj_1268:The other involves the sale of about 35 of the company's high-end workstations to the National Institutes of Health.
12/wsj_1268:The awards are evidence that Silicon Graphics' approach to computer graphics is catching on with users of powerful desktop computers, analysts said. 
12/wsj_1268:In the battle to supply desktop computers for researchers and design engineers, most of the attention is given to the biggest competitors: Sun Microsystems Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Digital Equipment Corp., which make computers mainly aimed at a wide range of engineering and scientific needs. 
12/wsj_1268:Silicon Graphics, on the other hand, has targeted a specific niche since its inception in 1982, which has been dubbed by some as "motion-picture computing." This is a style of "visual" computing that provides three-dimensional, color models of everything from the inside of a house to the latest in women's fashion. 
12/wsj_1268:Though Silicon Graphics is much smaller than Digital, Hewlett and Sun, it has emerged in recent years as a feared adversary in this graphics portion of the workstation market. 
12/wsj_1268:In addition, the company has made it tough on competitors by offering a stream of desktop computers at sharply lower prices.
12/wsj_1268:Silicon Graphics also plans to unveil even less expensive machines in the near future. "It's pretty safe to assume we can bring the cost down of these systems by 30% to 40% a year," said Edward McCracken, the company's chief executive officer. 
12/wsj_1269:Remember those bulky, thick-walled refrigerators of 30 years ago?
12/wsj_1269:These and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air conditioners to foam cushioning to commercial solvents are in prospect because of something called the Montreal Protocol, signed by 24 nations in 1987.
12/wsj_1269:In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date -- involving products with an annual value of $135 billion in the U.S. alone -- the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
12/wsj_1269:The U.S. Senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of 89 to 0.
12/wsj_1269:That's a lot of banishment, as it turns out.
12/wsj_1269:Polyurethane foam is a highly efficient insulator, which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and freezers can be thinner now than they were back in the days when they were insulated with glass fiber. 
12/wsj_1269:But even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $100 billion between now and the year 2000 to convert to other coolants, foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes, the Montreal Protocol's legions of supporters say it is worth it.
12/wsj_1269:They insist that CFCs are damaging the earth's stratospheric ozone layer, which screens out some of the sun's ultraviolet rays.
12/wsj_1269:Peter Teagan, a specialist in heat transfer, is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc., of Cambridge, Mass., to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate CFCs.
12/wsj_1269:In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming, a theory that mankind's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a "greenhouse effect" that will work important climatic changes in the earth's atmosphere over time. 
12/wsj_1269:"I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems," says Mr. Teagan. "In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently.
12/wsj_1269:But the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon, before all the evidence is in.
12/wsj_1269:Some atmospheric scientists think that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate, the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10% by the middle of the next century.
12/wsj_1269:Moreover, there are questions, particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best, about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer.
12/wsj_1269:It is generally agreed that when CFCs rise from earth to stratosphere, the chlorine in them is capable of interfering with the process through which ultraviolet rays split oxygen molecules and form ozone.
12/wsj_1269:But ozone creation is a very large-scale natural process and the importance of human-generated CFCs in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture.
12/wsj_1269:But it is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerators in Antarctica.
12/wsj_1269:Another argument of the environmentalists is that if substitutes are available, why not use them?
12/wsj_1269:Mr. Teagan cites a list of substitutes but none, so far, match the nonflammable, nontoxic CFCs.
12/wsj_1269:One answer is that big companies are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them, although they never care to put it quite that way.
12/wsj_1269:Imperial Chemical Industries of the U.K. also has one, and is building a plant in Louisiana to produce it.
12/wsj_1269:Japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own substitutes and hoping to conquer new markets, of course. 
12/wsj_1269:Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it.
12/wsj_1269:In other words, environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few.
12/wsj_1269:That tends to tilt the public debate toward "solutions" even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency.
12/wsj_1269:There is an element of make-work involved. 
12/wsj_1269:Consumers pay the bill for all this in the price of a refrigerator or an air-conditioned car.
12/wsj_1270:Much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor's initiatives on issues the small-business community traditionally opposes -- from raising state minimum wage levels to mandating benefits in health plans.
12/wsj_1270:While results were mixed in many states, "small business got by fairly well," concludes Don L. Robinson, associate director of the National Federation of Independent Business, the largest small-business organization. 
12/wsj_1270:In 17 central states, one small-business count shows lawmakers adopted only three of 46 bills mandating health coverage or parental leave.
12/wsj_1270:Small business is bracing for an avalanche of similar proposals next year. 
12/wsj_1270:"Those kinds of issues always keep coming back," says Robert Beckwith, who manages the Illinois Chamber of Commerce's small-business office. 
12/wsj_1270:Only two states -- Vermont and Washington -- this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants.
12/wsj_1270:But small business, which generally detests government-mandated benefits, has taken note of the growing number of close votes. "It's just a matter of time before the tide turns," says one Midwestern lobbyist. 
12/wsj_1270:They also support a tax credit for employers to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave. 
12/wsj_1270:"We'll be playing a lot of defense, especially in the Midwest and Northeast," says Jim Buente of the NFIB. 
12/wsj_1270:Council member Joy Picus, the measure's chief advocate, considers it part of a "pro-family policy" that makes Los Angeles a leader in "humanizing the workplace." 
12/wsj_1270:In San Francisco, small businesses are urging passage of a local initiative to build a new $95 million downtown baseball stadium; they believe it will spur retail sales and hotel-restaurant business.
12/wsj_1270:Wessels & Pautsch, a small St. Charles law firm, plans to mail 500 customers a list of its lawyers' new phone and fax numbers as well as updated Rolodex cards.
12/wsj_1270:Even print-shop operator Clay Smith of Naperville won't discard his old supply. (He reports his business is up slightly from customers replacing old stock.) 
12/wsj_1270:Now some negotiated sales that meet a series of tests don't have to be pre-registered.
12/wsj_1270:For instance, franchisers no longer must pre-register sales to aspiring franchisees who qualify as "sophisticated purchasers." Such buyers must have a minimum net worth of $1 million, $200,000 annual income, or recent experience in the business area of the franchise being sold. 
12/wsj_1270:SMALL TALK: A new Maryland law frees store owners of liability if a customer trips or otherwise gets hurt on the way to the restroom. . . . Only 4% of Missouri small businesses surveyed say they've tested an employee or applicant for drug or alcohol use. . . . By 52%-36%, Tennessee NFIB members favor laws to limit foreign ownership of land and facilities in the state. 
12/wsj_1271:It will take several weeks to repair the bridge, and several months to repair some of the 101 connections. 
12/wsj_1271:But in spite of a wind-driven rainstorm, gridlock never materialized, mainly because the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system carried 50% more passengers than normal.
12/wsj_1271:Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge, which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span, actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday, provided they could find a parking space at the system's jammed stations.
12/wsj_1271:In the best of times, the Bay Bridge is the worst commute in the region, often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more. 
12/wsj_1271:But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the Golden Gate, by 8 a.m. it already had thinned out. "It's one of the smoothest commutes I've ever had," said Charles Catania, an insurance broker on the bus from Mill Valley in Marin County. "It looks like a holiday.
12/wsj_1271:I think a lot of people got scared and stayed home." However, a spokeswoman for BankAmerica Corp. said yesterday's absenteeism at the bank holding company was no greater than on an average day. 
12/wsj_1271:Of Bechtel's 17,500 employees, about 4,000 work in San Francisco -- one-third of them commuting from stricken East Bay. 
12/wsj_1271:The flextime may cut by almost a third the number of PG&E employees working conventional 9-5 hours, a spokesman says.
12/wsj_1271:Some of the utility's employees may opt for a four-day workweek, 10 hours a day, to cut the commute by 20%. 
12/wsj_1271:At Pacific Telesis Group, flextime is left up to individual working groups, because some of the telephone company's employees must be on-site during normal business hours, a spokeswoman says. 
12/wsj_1271:Although one transportation official said drivers who didn't use car pools were committing "an anti-social act," about two-thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone, compared with the normal 70% rate.
12/wsj_1271:And some commuters, relieved by the absence of gridlock, were planning to return to their old ways. 
12/wsj_1272:His strategy against D.T. was based on a thorough study of dozens of its games, he said, including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters Bent Larsen of Denmark and Robert Byrne of the U.S. Mr. Kasparov was underwhelmed. "The computer's mind is too straight, too primitive," lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top, he said. 
12/wsj_1272:Its chief builder, Taiwan-born Feng-hsiung Hsu, nicknamed his brainchild "the Weasel" for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions.
12/wsj_1272:D.T. also has a prodigious and flawless memory, is utterly fearless, and couldn't be distracted by the sexy nude sculptures spread around the playing hall, in the New York Academy of Art.
12/wsj_1272:No human can examine millions of moves, but Mr. Kasparov, using his ineffably powerful brain, consistently found very good ones. 
12/wsj_1272:After eight moves by each side, the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980.
12/wsj_1272:Instead of castling, a standard measure to safeguard the king, D.T. made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13; then it put a knight offside on move 16. "Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players, and computers," said Edmar Mednis, the expert commentator for the match, which was attended by hundreds of chess fans. 
12/wsj_1272:It allowed Mr. Kasparov to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of D.T.'s knights.
12/wsj_1272:When most spectators thought its position hopeless, the computer thought it was only, in effect, one-half of a pawn down.
12/wsj_1272:No amount of weasling could have saved this game for D.T.
12/wsj_1272:With the advantage of playing white (which moves first), Mr. Kasparov followed up cleverly against the computer's defense, a Queen's Gambit Accepted. 
12/wsj_1272:As early as move six, Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves, developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer's advanced knight.
12/wsj_1272:This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies -- and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn, to the neglect of kingside development. 
12/wsj_1272:Greedily, it grabbed a pawn, at the cost of facing a brutal attack.
12/wsj_1272:On a demonstration board, emcee Shelby Lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice; no spectator refuted this line of play.
12/wsj_1272:Indeed, three of them will be building a successor machine for International Business Machines Corp. Promises Feng-hsiung Hsu: "In three years we'll mount a better challenge." 
12/wsj_1273:Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake -- especially if you don't understand what you're investing in. 
12/wsj_1273:In May 1986, Dr. Blumenfeld gave Merrill Lynch & Co. about $40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9%. 
12/wsj_1273:But nearly 3 1/2 years later, Merrill says the investment is worth about $43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2% on Dr. Blumenfeld's $40,000. 
12/wsj_1273:Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4% when it was issued in 1984, and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then, part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD's increased market value. 
12/wsj_1273:Several phone calls and a visit to his broker's office later, the dentist found out that the $9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD, and that the amount wasn't insured. "This is one thing I was never aware of," he says.
12/wsj_1273:Especially at times like these, when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect, too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk. 
12/wsj_1273:"Yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things," says John Markese, research director of the American Association of Individual Investors, a Chicago-based educational group. "The biggest problem we have is that investors realize, after the fact, that they didn't understand what they were investing in." 
12/wsj_1273:He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs (Treasury Income Growth Receipts), a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch.
12/wsj_1273:The broker, Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch's Morristown, N.J., office, refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter, referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York.
12/wsj_1273:Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a "fact sheet" sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale. 
12/wsj_1273:The fact sheet, dated April 1986, says on page three: "If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market . . . is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs, the difference . . . is not insured . . . . Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant." 
12/wsj_1273:Dr. Blumenfeld says he doesn't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and didn't realize part of what he paid was a premium. "I assumed I was buying a CD as a CD," he says. 
12/wsj_1273:Nevertheless, Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld's CD, Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina, Kan., is liquidated and the CD terminated, the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid. (Federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation, to a maximum of $100,000.) 
12/wsj_1273:"It's not a blanket commitment, it's a case-by-case situation," says Albert Disposti, a managing director of Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc. "There's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware" of the risks. "We weren't sure that full disclosure, as we wanted it, was being made." 
12/wsj_1273:Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding, and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total.
12/wsj_1273:Still, there are several billion dollars of zero-coupon CDs with various maturities outstanding. 
12/wsj_1273:Because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments -- income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued, although interest isn't actually paid until maturity -- zero-coupon CDs are usually sold for tax-advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and children's education.
12/wsj_1273:Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years, and they usually double in value by maturity. 
12/wsj_1273:But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market aren't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments isn't insured.
12/wsj_1273:However, those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs, and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid. 
12/wsj_1274:And those efforts are paying off: Spirits exports jumped more than 2 1/2 times to $157.2 million in 1988 from $59.8 million in 1983, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S., a trade group. 
12/wsj_1274:"Spirits companies now view themselves as global marketers," says Michael Bellas, president of Beverage Marketing Corp., a research and consulting firm. "If you want to be a player, you have to be in America, Europe and the Far East.
12/wsj_1274:The internationalization of the industry has been hastened by foreign companies' acquisitions of many U.S. producers.
12/wsj_1274:In recent years, for example, Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain acquired Heublein Inc., while another British company, Guinness PLC, took over United Distillers Group and Schenley Industries Inc. 
12/wsj_1274:Exports of rum surged 54% to 814,000 proof gallons.
12/wsj_1274:Mexico is the biggest importer of both rum and brandy from the U.S. 
12/wsj_1274:In Australia, Britain, Canada and Greece, Brown-Forman Corp. has increased its marketing of Southern Comfort Liqueur.
12/wsj_1274:Using cinema, television and print ads, the company pitches Southern Comfort as a grand old drink of the antebellum American South. 
12/wsj_1274:While U.S. makers of vodka, rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad, trade agreements prohibit any other country from making bourbon. (All bourbon comes from Kentucky, though Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey often is counted as bourbon because of similarity of taste.) Moreover, just as vodka has acquired an upscale image in the U.S., bourbon has become fashionable in many foreign countries, a uniquely American product tied to frontier folklore.
12/wsj_1274:"We imagine with bourbon the Wild West, Western motion pictures and gunmen appearing," says Kenji Kishimoto, vice president of Suntory International Corp., a division of Suntory Ltd., Japan's largest liquor company.
12/wsj_1274:Bourbon makes up just 1% of world-wide spirits consumption, but it represented 57% of U.S. liquor exports last year, according to Jobson; no other category had more than 19%.
12/wsj_1274:Jim Beam Brands Co., a division of American Brands Inc., is the leading exporter of bourbon and produces 10 other types of liquor.
12/wsj_1274:The company says it will increase its international advertising 35% in 1990, with bourbon representing most of that amount. 
12/wsj_1274:The company's I.W. Harper brand is the leading bourbon in Japan, with 40% of the market. 
12/wsj_1274:To promote Jack Daniel's overseas, Brown-Forman uses the same photos of front porches from Lynchburg, Va., and avuncular old men in overalls and hightops. 
12/wsj_1274:In Australia, land of the outback, a snapshot of Jim Beam lies on a strip of hand-tooled leather.
12/wsj_1275:The broadcasting unit reported operating profit of $134.9 million, up 18% from the year-earlier $114.3 million.
12/wsj_1275:Revenue at the broadcasting unit, consisting of the network and stations, advanced 11%, to $838 million from $752.9 million.
12/wsj_1275:Chairman Thomas S. Murphy cited Capital Cities' nine daily newspapers in explaining most of the gain.
12/wsj_1276:As part of a previously announced transaction, Federal Mogul Corp. has bought approximately 565,000 shares of its common stock from Nortek Inc. at $23.50 a share.
12/wsj_1276:Nortek has agreed not to acquire any securities of Federal-Mogul for 10 years and not to influence company affairs during that period. 
12/wsj_1277:Weyerhaeuser Co. said it sold its wall-paneling business to an affiliate of one of Indonesia's largest wood-products firms. 
12/wsj_1277:Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed. 
12/wsj_1278:Manville said it expects the plant to begin operating at the end of 1991. 
12/wsj_1279:"I am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that would return interest rates to the historical level of 4% or 5% would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts, the housing stock, our industry in America, the refurbishing of our industrial system, it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit," Mr. Kemp said. 
12/wsj_1280:McDonald's Corp. said third-quarter earnings rose 14% on a hefty sales gain, but domestic franchisees apparently didn't partake of the improvement. 
12/wsj_1280:In the latest period, the company had an average of 370.8 million shares, 5.6 million shares below last year's level. 
12/wsj_1280:Compared with the first nine months of last year, average franchisee store sales this year were down nearly $3,200, reflecting a fierce discounting war among fast-food chains.
12/wsj_1280:Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Leslie Steppel said reduced labor costs helped boost margins, although she doubted "that kind of performance is sustainable." Calling sales "still relatively soft," Ms. Steppel believes that in real terms, U.S. sales slipped 3 1/2% to 4% at company-operated stores in the quarter. 
12/wsj_1280:"Going into the fourth quarter the sales comparison will be more difficult," predicted restaurant analyst Howard Hansen of Kidder, Peabody & Co. 
12/wsj_1280:Reflecting better growth prospects abroad, McDonald's noted that as of Sept. 30 more stores were under construction overseas than a year ago, while the opposite was true for domestic expansion.
12/wsj_1280:At the end of the third quarter McDonald's had 10,873 units operating world-wide. 
12/wsj_1281:Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. 's common stock was dragged down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a Finnish shipbuilder would delay delivery of three big cruise ships. 
12/wsj_1281:"There is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect, if any, of all this is," said John P. Uphoff, an analyst at Raymond James Associates Inc. "I didn't even know that a company in a socialistic country could file for bankruptcy." 
12/wsj_1281:Carnival said the "Fantasy," the first of the three $200 million ships that Carnival has on order, is scheduled to be delivered next month, just in time for the winter tourist season in the Caribbean.
12/wsj_1281:That ship, which would carry about 2,050 passengers, would expand the capacity of Carnival's existing 14-ship fleet by 24%.
12/wsj_1281:Normally, a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction.
12/wsj_1281:Carnival, for example, has already paid about $160 million of the total cost for Fantasy.
12/wsj_1281:The shipyard disclosed in mid-August that it expected losses stemming from a series of unprofitable orders. 
12/wsj_1282:The designer, whose line of modular, one-size-fits-all clothing has spawned a host of clones, has been in a dispute with her latest licensee, Jerell Inc. for several months. 
12/wsj_1282:Ms. Garratt was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in March. 
12/wsj_1282:Ms. Garratt sued the Dallas apparel maker earlier this year, charging that Jerell developed and marketed clothing lines fashioned after her designs, in violation of their contract.
12/wsj_1283:Eaton Corp. had a 26% drop in third-quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts, its largest and most profitable single business. 
12/wsj_1283:Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continue to lag previous-year rates, leading Eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels, said Stephen R. Hardis, vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer.
12/wsj_1283:The quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales didn't rebound in September from the summer doldrums as they usually do, said Patrick E. Sheridan, analyst with McDonald & Co. Mr. Sheridan, who had been expecting quarter profit of about $1.25 a share, says he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $5.70 a share, from his previous estimate of $6.10. 
12/wsj_1283:Eli Lustgarten of PaineWebber Inc., who a couple of weeks ago reduced his 1989 estimate to $5.70 a share because of the weakening truck market, says he will make another cut to about $5.50 a share in light of the third-quarter report.
12/wsj_1283:Eaton said sales of truck axles, transmissions and other parts fell 7.2% to $295 million.
12/wsj_1283:Sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose.
12/wsj_1283:The truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods, he said, and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward spiral. 
12/wsj_1283:For the nine months, net -- including profit from discontinued operations both years and in 1988 an extraordinary charge of $17.7 million related to settlement of a lawsuit -- was $170.6 million, or $4.54 a share, up 5.8% from $161.3 million, or $4.32 a share, a year ago.
12/wsj_1284:In Poland's rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative, environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy, cut cumbersome bureaucracies, and democratize local politics. 
12/wsj_1284:Even more remarkably, it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution, notwithstanding Poland's lack of functioning markets. 
12/wsj_1284:The answer lies both in the degraded environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that degradation. 
12/wsj_1284:According to a detailed report by Zbigniew Bochniarz of the University of Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey Institute, 27 areas containing a third of Poland's population are regarded as "ecological hazards" due to multiple violations of standards.
12/wsj_1284:Norms are consistently exceeded at 60% of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80% of those for dust and soot emissions.
12/wsj_1284:Four-fifths of Poland's soils have become highly acidified; 70% of its southern forests are projected to die by century's end.
12/wsj_1284:Between 1965 and 1985, Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33% to 6% of all surface waters, while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled. 
12/wsj_1284:Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe.
12/wsj_1284:Since 1978, average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP. 
12/wsj_1284:Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from (a) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources, which are not produced by labor; (b) planned economies' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government; and (c) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development, producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West.
12/wsj_1284:They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership, genuine competition based on market factors, and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions. 
12/wsj_1284:And the Poles are engaged in commerce." But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution, or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year.
12/wsj_1284:As conferees noted, scarce capital means the costs of control must be minimized through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms.
12/wsj_1284:That means simple, clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction, deferring more complex issues such as risk.
12/wsj_1284:It also means use of quantity-based pollution limits such as transferable permits, rather than price-based limits such as effluent fees.
12/wsj_1284:Even least-cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars.
12/wsj_1284:New types of financing must make funds available without draining Poland's hard-currency reserves. 
12/wsj_1284:While Polish data have been freely available since 1980, it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information.
12/wsj_1284:Mr. Levin, former head of EPA's regulatory reform staff, adapted this from his November column for the Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association. 
12/wsj_1285:Disappointing earnings news from some technology companies unnerved investors in the over-the-counter market, who sold shares of Apple Computer, Intel and many other computer-related concerns. 
12/wsj_1285:Mostly because of the sell-off in technology stocks, the Nasdaq 100 Index of the OTC's largest non-financial issues dropped 4.58 to 457.52.
12/wsj_1285:The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking issues lost 2.38 to 458.32. 
12/wsj_1285:Some traders said the sell-off of technology stocks on low volume reflected a lack of conviction by investors.
12/wsj_1285:But Charlie Howley, vice president in charge of OTC trading at SoundView Financial in Stamford, Conn., said the selling was orderly. 
12/wsj_1285:"It's a quiet retreat," said Mr. Howley. "It's nothing dramatic, just a routine sell-off." Some of it was due to lower-than-expected earnings from leading companies, he said.
12/wsj_1285:But some of it also represented profit-taking by investors who have made big gains in some issues. 
12/wsj_1285:Yesterday's volume of 117.2 million shares was far below last week's sizzling average of nearly 177 million.
12/wsj_1285:The increase of $1.25 a share is being made to settle shareholder litigation relating to SIBV-MS's tender offer. 
12/wsj_1285:SIBV-MS Holdings is a new company jointly owned by an affiliate of Jefferson Smurfit and a Morgan Stanley limited partnership.
12/wsj_1285:The Jefferson Smurfit affiliate, Smurfit International B.V., holds about 78% of the shares outstanding.
12/wsj_1285:These shares will be bought by SIBV-MS Holdings at $41.75 each after the acquisition of the minority shares. 
12/wsj_1285:Some analysts say investors will begin paying more attention to earnings, partly in response to the latest round of disappointments.
12/wsj_1285:They say investors will favor companies that historically have posted annual earnings growth of 15% to 20%.
12/wsj_1285:Michael R. Weisberg, partner in charge of research at Robertson Stephens & Co. in San Francisco, said some investors have already made the switch.
12/wsj_1285:The Robertson Stephens Index of 340 emerging growth stocks is up 23.1% for the year through Friday.
12/wsj_1285:The rise matches that of the Dow Jones industrials this year. 
12/wsj_1285:He predicted that the most popular growth companies will be those with "some kind of unique product or franchise" that makes them appear able to sustain their momentum.
12/wsj_1285:Nellcor, a maker of electronic patient monitoring systems, was up 3/4 to 16 7/8 on 258,000 shares yesterday, while retailing issue Office Club was unchanged at 10 3/4 on 65,200 shares.
12/wsj_1285:Other favorites of growth-stock analysts and money managers also had a mixed session.
12/wsj_1285:Payco American, a credit collection concern, jumped 1 3/8 to 20 5/8 on volume of 93,000, and Mail Boxes Etc., a private postal services company, advanced 1/2 to 23 1/2 on volume of 64,000.
12/wsj_1286:And the reason we don't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular, as well as to violate some cherished vested interests.
12/wsj_1286:If I were to ask a sample of American parents, "Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children?" the near-unanimous answer would be, "Yes, of course." But what do we mean, specifically, by "creativity"?
12/wsj_1286:In practice, it ends up being equated with a "self-expression" that encourages the youngsters' "self-esteem." The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves. 
12/wsj_1286:The whole notion of "creativity" in education was (and is) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction, which was (and is) regarded as "authoritarian," a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful, if as yet undefined, potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children.
12/wsj_1286:American education's future will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share. 
12/wsj_1286:The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way.
12/wsj_1286:They may not be among the "best and brightest" of their generation -- there are very few such people, by definition.
12/wsj_1286:But our education proceeded at the hands of those others, who were merely competent and conscientious.
12/wsj_1286:Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity; it is not an educational problem.
12/wsj_1286:It is the kind of libel the teachers' unions don't mind spreading, for their own narrow purposes.
12/wsj_1286:It is also the kind of libel politicians find useful, since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency.
12/wsj_1286:But there is not one shred of evidence that, other things being equal, salary differentials result in educational differentials.
12/wsj_1286:If there were such evidence, you can be sure you would have heard of it. 
12/wsj_1286:There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation, some of them in the poorest of ghettos, and they are all sending us the same message.
12/wsj_1286:Conversely, there are the majority of unsuccessful schools, and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand.
12/wsj_1286:Thus at the recent governors' conference on education, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that "this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five." A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need.
12/wsj_1286:Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children.
12/wsj_1286:If parents are dissatisfied with a school, they should have the option of switching to another. 
12/wsj_1286:Here, the experience of New York City is decisive.
12/wsj_1286:Locally elected school boards, especially in our larger cities, become the prey of ambitious, generally corrupt, and invariably demagogic local politicians or would-be politicians.
12/wsj_1286:New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance, even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute it. 
12/wsj_1286:The reason is simple: Education takes place in the classroom, where the influence of money is minimal. 
12/wsj_1286:Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons.
12/wsj_1286:There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures (in real terms) have increased sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance has declined.
12/wsj_1286:This means "tracking," whose main purpose is less to permit the gifted youngsters to flourish (though that is clearly desirable) than to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for entering the modern world of work.
12/wsj_1286:The purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential.
12/wsj_1286:-- It is generally desirable to use older textbooks -- many of them, alas, out of print -- rather than newer ones.
12/wsj_1286:One of the reasons American students do so poorly in math tests, as compared with British, French, German or Japanese students, is the influence of the "New Math" on American textbooks and teaching methods. 
12/wsj_1286:Anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is -- with students who can't add or subtract "learning" the conceptual basis of mathematical theory -- should read the article by Caleb Nelson (himself a recent math major at Harvard) in the November American Spectator. 
12/wsj_1286:-- Most important of all, schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty, the curriculum, and all matters of student discipline.
12/wsj_1286:Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head.
12/wsj_1286:With that authority, of course, goes an unambiguous accountability.
12/wsj_1286:This is a fact -- though, in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact, it is not surprising that one hears so little about it. 
12/wsj_1287:The company unveiled more than 50 products, mostly software, that are designed to integrate the three areas of a manufacturing operation -- the plant floor, design operations and production planning.
12/wsj_1287:The aim, ultimately, is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer's main computer network for use in business planning, marketing and other operations. 
12/wsj_1287:Manufacturers have already spent so heavily on automation that they are one of the computer industry's leading revenue sources.
12/wsj_1287:But many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been rendered nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used by different machines, including robots and machine tools. 
12/wsj_1287:Consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the IBM strategy to fall into place, even though the specific products IBM unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter. 
12/wsj_1287:He said he believes IBM's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers' problems and wasn't just selling technology.
12/wsj_1287:Rather than just send out marketing people to knock on customers' doors, IBM is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs.
12/wsj_1288:Japan's Big Four securities firms posted first-half unconsolidated results that mirrored softer performance as a result of slower turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during July and August. 
12/wsj_1288:The statistics follow a year-on-year rebound in consolidated and unconsolidated results in the full fiscal year ended in March 1989, recovering from dismal results in the prior fiscal year as a result of the October 1987 stock market crash. 
12/wsj_1289:Harken Energy Corp. of Dallas said it will drop its $11.75-a-share, or $190 million, offer for Tesoro Petroleum Corp. if the two companies don't have an agreement to merge by Dec. 15. 
12/wsj_1290:Francis D. John, 35-year-old president, will assume the additional job of chief executive officer.
12/wsj_1290:National Environmental also said it will move its headquarters from Hingham to Folcroft, Pa., the site of its sludge dewatering facility.
12/wsj_1291:Eagle Clothes Inc., which is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, said it reached an agreement with its creditors. 
12/wsj_1291:Under the accord, Albert Roth, chairman and chief executive officer, and Arthur Chase, Sam Beigel, and Louis Polsky will resign as officers and directors of the menswear retailer.
12/wsj_1291:Mr. Roth, who has been on leave from his posts, will be succeeded by Geoffrie D. Lurie of GDL Management Inc., which is Eagle's crisis manager.
12/wsj_1291:In addition, a Norfolk affiliate, York Capital Inc., will purchase all of the interests of Eagle's secured lenders, which total $11.5 million, and guarantee as much as $8.2 million in payments to Eagle's unsecured creditors.
12/wsj_1291:It would extinguish all of Eagle's existing capital stock and issue new stock to York as sole holder. 
12/wsj_1291:Eagle's management retired and Biny's management took control of the company. 
12/wsj_1291:At the time, Eagle reached a new credit agreement with Bankers Trust and with Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York for $8 million, and a new subordinated debt accord with First Century Partners and Biny management for $2 million.
12/wsj_1292:Standard & Poor's Corp. said it would add John H. Harland Co., an Atlanta check printer, to its 500-stock index, effective at the close of trading on Wednesday. 
12/wsj_1293:Industry assets as of Aug. 31 were $1.31 trillion, the lowest since August 1988. 
12/wsj_1293:It was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their capital in relation to their assets, the Office of Thrift Supervision said.
12/wsj_1293:"The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way," said Bert Ely, an industry consultant in Alexandria, Va. "This suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have imagined so soon." 
12/wsj_1293:James Barth, an economist with the Office of Thrift Supervision, also attributed some of the outflow to seasonal factors. "August is a month when people are paying school tuition," he said. "That and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry." 
12/wsj_1293:For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August, assets declined by $3.3 billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $1.2 billion. 
12/wsj_1293:As of Aug. 31, thrifts held $185 billion in mortgage-backed securities. 
12/wsj_1293:The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year.
12/wsj_1293:For the first eight months of 1989, thrifts' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $44.5 billion.
12/wsj_1294:The estimates of real gross national product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce significantly understate the rate of economic growth.
12/wsj_1294:Since the bureau's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by the Department of Labor, underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics. 
12/wsj_1294:If this thesis is correct, it has important implications for macroeconomic policies: It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP.
12/wsj_1294:It would also affect the perceptions of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the informed public generally, as to what constitutes a reasonable degree of price stability. 
12/wsj_1294:In the early 1980s, I predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade.
12/wsj_1294:This forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces -- such as demographic changes, the oil shock and accelerating inflation -- that had reduced productivity gains in the 1970s.
12/wsj_1294:The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data. 
12/wsj_1294:The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates (mainly employment or hours) instead of output estimates for those sectors, such as governments, paid household services and private non-profit institutions, where there are difficulties in assembling output data.
12/wsj_1294:This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor.
12/wsj_1294:In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees, it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7% during the 1980s.
12/wsj_1294:Even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector, this Labor Department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of 0.2 percentage point a year, on average. 
12/wsj_1294:The federal productivity estimators use labor input, rather than output, data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well.
12/wsj_1294:Independent estimates of output in those industries, including one by the Department of Labor for banking, suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5% a year between 1948 and 1988.
12/wsj_1294:The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes.
12/wsj_1294:I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product. 
12/wsj_1294:Finally, the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services.
12/wsj_1294:Since then, further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least 0.26 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate. 
12/wsj_1294:In sum, the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP.
12/wsj_1294:In other words, the growth rates of both total GNP and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about 20%. 
12/wsj_1294:Mr. Kendrick is professor emeritus of economics at George Washington University.
12/wsj_1294:He is co-author of "Personal Productivity: How to Increase Your Satisfaction in Living" (M.E.
12/wsj_1295:Carbide, like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry, was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong 1988 third quarter.
12/wsj_1295:"It certainly wasn't a disaster, but it does show weakness" in some of the company's chief markets, said George Krug, a chemicals-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. 
12/wsj_1295:Some producers of polyethylene, figuring the inventory reductions are near an end, have announced price boosts.
12/wsj_1295:The first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks, when the new prices become effective.
12/wsj_1295:The latest quarter included a gain of about $62 million on the sale of the company's urethane polyols and propylene glycols businesses.
12/wsj_1295:That gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $55 million from a write-down in its polysilicon business.
12/wsj_1296:The reluctance of some states to let Drexel off the hook could hamper the firm's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month, say several people familiar with the discussions. 
12/wsj_1296:Up to now, Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
12/wsj_1296:These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon. 
12/wsj_1296:Officials in some of these states say they don't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel.
12/wsj_1296:Drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $650 million in penalties.
12/wsj_1296:These stem from a two-year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on Wall Street. 
12/wsj_1296:Ohio, the District of Columbia, Tennessee and Illinois have been less resistant to Drexel than the other six states, but nonetheless have refused to settle so far, say those familiar with the discussions. 
12/wsj_1296:Drexel says it doesn't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked, and even if some are, its securities business wouldn't be directly hurt.
12/wsj_1296:Still, if nothing else, a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which Drexel could be involved. 
12/wsj_1296:"There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue," said Susan Bryant, Oklahoma's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel.
12/wsj_1296:The question, she said, is whether Drexel should be allowed to pay and move on, or "whether you should (simply) revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony." 
12/wsj_1296:While Ms. Bryant's state went ahead and accepted Drexel's settlement offer of $25,000, she said: "I don't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions.
12/wsj_1296:Similarly, Alfred Rubega, New Hampshire's director of securities regulation, said his state hadn't received any complaints about Drexel, so it really couldn't press the issue.
12/wsj_1296:Mr. Cohen, the Drexel general counsel, said, "I don't think, as we say in investment banking, that `by the end of the day' we'll be losing any licenses." Asked about states that are taking a hard line, he said, "There are states that have asked for additional information, which we are providing to them." 
12/wsj_1296:Mr. Cohen said more than $2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that Drexel still expects to pay out a total of $11.5 million.
12/wsj_1296:By the end of this week, Drexel should have another three to four settlements, Mr. Cohen said. 
12/wsj_1296:"The rate we're going, I think that by the end of the month, we're looking to have a total of 30 to 35," he said. 
12/wsj_1296:The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry.
12/wsj_1296:A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday. 
12/wsj_1296:Drexel's proposed state fines have been based on a state's population and on the size of Drexel's business in the state. 
12/wsj_1296:Connecticut already has issued a "notice of intent" to revoke Drexel's brokerage license.
12/wsj_1296:It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and asked for additional information about investors' accounts and other matters. "This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market," state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown said.
12/wsj_1296:Particularly touchy are the cases of New York, which is Drexel's base, and California, the base of Drexel's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm's legal difficulties.
12/wsj_1296:Ms. Bryant, the head of the state securities group, said Drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive check-kiting scheme several years ago.
12/wsj_1296:"This process should point out that it's not going to be easy for a firm that's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business," Ms. Bryant said. "We need to have somebody worried so they don't do this again." 
12/wsj_1296:These are the 26 states, including the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, that have settled with Drexel: Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wyoming and Puerto Rico. 
12/wsj_1297:Time Warner Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $176 million, or $2.88 cents a share, reflecting acquisition costs for a 59.3% stake in Warner Communications Inc. and the purchase method of accounting for the transaction. 
12/wsj_1297:Separately, Warner reported a net loss of $106 million, or 56 cents a share, including merger expenses of $100 million and $120 million in charges associated with stock-appreciation-based compensation plans. 
12/wsj_1297:Time Warner is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining Warner shares.
12/wsj_1297:On a pro-forma basis, assuming the merger was effective Jan 1, 1988, including the results from both Time Inc. and all of Warner, that cash flow figure would be $526 million for the latest quarter, more than double the comparable figure a year ago, or $242 million, according to Time Warner. 
12/wsj_1297:Some analysts at least are buying that argument, and weren't alarmed by the losses. "What really matters is the operating income of the divisions: I look at these numbers and I say, these businesses are doing well," said Mark Manson, a vice president of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. "For example, Warner made more than $100 million from filmed entertainment in three months.
12/wsj_1297:Warner also had a gain of more than 13% from records and music publishing, even though the domestic record business was sluggish this summer." 
12/wsj_1297:In the year-ago third quarter, Time on its own reported net income of $81 million, or $1.42 a share.
12/wsj_1297:Combined revenue for the latest quarter of Time Warner was $2.2 billion, compared with the year-ago Time revenue of $1.1 billion. 
12/wsj_1297:On a pro forma basis, including all of Warner's earnings, Time Warner had a third-quarter loss of $217 million, compared with a $342 million loss a year earlier.
12/wsj_1297:For the third quarter, Warner's $106 million loss compared with a year-ago loss of $113 million, or 90 cents a share.
12/wsj_1297:The 1988 figures were restated to include the results of Lorimar Telepictures Corp., which Warner acquired in January. 
12/wsj_1297:Warner also contributed record results from its music business, where unit sales of compact discs rose more than 50% from a year ago, the company said, helped by Prince's "Batman" soundtrack. 
12/wsj_1297:The programming division saw a decline in operating cash flow because the year-ago quarter included a $12 million dividend from Turner Broadcasting System and because the quarter includes expenses associated with the Nov. 15 launch of HBO's Comedy Channel. 
12/wsj_1298:UNR recently emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings that left 64% of the reorganized company's common stock in the hands of trustees of an asbestos-disease claims trust.
12/wsj_1299:Some House Democrats are trying to head off an appointment by President Bush to the board that oversees the savings-and-loan bailout, contending that the prospective nominee is the head of troubled banks himself. 
12/wsj_1299:Four Democrats on the House Banking Committee sent President Bush a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of James Simmons, an Arizona banker and former fund-raiser for Mr. Bush, to the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp. 
12/wsj_1299:The Oversight Board, created in the savings-and-loan law signed in August, sets policy for the RTC, which will sell hundreds of the nation's sick thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets.
12/wsj_1299:Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp are members of the board.
12/wsj_1299:An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. Simmons, the chairman of Valley National Bank in Phoenix, is the Republican appointee, and that a security clearance was under way.
12/wsj_1299:The letter, dated last Thursday, cited the losses at Valley National, and at United Bank, also of Phoenix, where Mr. Simmons was chairman for 29 years.
12/wsj_1299:Valley National, for example, had $470 million in problem assets as of June. 
12/wsj_1299:He was co-chairman of Mr. Bush's Arizona campaign committee in last year's election, and also worked for Mr. Bush in the 1980 election.
12/wsj_1299:The two met more than 30 years ago, when Mr. Simmons worked for Commercial Bank & Trust Co. of Midland, Texas, where Mr. Bush was an organizing director. 
12/wsj_1299:In 1986, Mr. Simmons also served on a committee of businessmen headed by William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp.
12/wsj_1299:Arizona Trend magazine referred to Mr. Simmons this year as one of the 25 most influential people in the state. 
12/wsj_1299:Bruce Vento (D., Minn.), the chairman of the Banking Committee's RTC Task Force, Thomas McMillen (D., Md.), Kweisi Mfume (D., Md.) and Paul Kanjorski (D., Pa.). 
13/wsj_1300:Randolph W. McElroy, a vice chairman of this bank-holding company, was named to the additional position of chairman of its principal unit, Sovran Bank.
13/wsj_1300:Mr. McElroy, 54 years old, will remain president and chief executive officer of the unit.
13/wsj_1300:Sovran also named John B. Werner a vice chairman of the parent company and the unit and elected him to the newly created position of chief credit officer of Sovran Financial, increasing the number of corporate board members to 35.
13/wsj_1300:Mr. Werner, 58, was formerly senior executive vice president of the parent company and the unit. 
13/wsj_1301:Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company.
13/wsj_1301:Moody's also said it raised its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank, now known as Bank One, Texas N.A., reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC. Officials at the New York bank-holding company weren't available for comment on the debt-rating changes. 
13/wsj_1302:At Lloyd's of London, underwriters still scratch out policies using fountain pens and blotting paper.
13/wsj_1302:Visitors are ushered into the premises by red-frocked doormen known as waiters, a reminder of the insurance market's origins in a coffeehouse in 17th century London. 
13/wsj_1302:Such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present. 
13/wsj_1302:Lloyd's, once a pillar of the world insurance market, is being shaken to its very foundation.
13/wsj_1302:The 301-year-old exchange is battered by enormous claims from a decade-long run of unprecedented disasters, the most recent of which is last week's earthquake in California's Bay Area.
13/wsj_1302:At the same time, Lloyd's is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time-honored ways of conducting business.
13/wsj_1302:The exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow, less-profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors. 
13/wsj_1302:Most troublesome is the shrinking pool of "names," the well-heeled investors (some of them royal) who, as members of about 360 syndicates, underwrite policies.
13/wsj_1302:Some 1,750 members quit the exchange last year, more than triple the number of resignations in 1987.
13/wsj_1302:Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange's most basic tenets, the concept of unlimited personal liability.
13/wsj_1302:Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims, but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe.
13/wsj_1302:During the five-year period ended 1986, roughly 80% of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates, according to Chatset consultants.
13/wsj_1302:The peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now. "I have wished I could die and be out of it -- that's how bad it is," Betty Atkins, a secretary from suburban London, says. 
13/wsj_1302:Ms. Atkins, who underwrote #20,000, or about $32,000, of insurance coverage on that syndicate, now faces potential losses of roughly #70,000, or $111,000. "If Lloyd's wants #70,000 out of me they will have to take everything I've got -- and even then I don't know if it will be enough," she says. 
13/wsj_1302:Unease is widespread among exchange members. "I can't think of any reason to join Lloyd's now," says Keith Whitten, a British businessman and a Lloyd's member since 1979. "The downside is very considerable, and at the moment the upside is very marginal." If profits don't improve, Mr. Whitten says he may quit the exchange. 
13/wsj_1302:Lloyd's is being squeezed out of low-margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance.
13/wsj_1302:Over the past decade, competitors have chipped away at the exchange's share of the #2.5 billion marine market in London, where half the world's ships are insured. 
13/wsj_1302:Lloyd's 66% stake in that market has shrunk to 50% in that period, according to an official at the Institute of London Underwriters, a Lloyd's competitor. (The official asked not to be named.) Much of the business has gone to the institute, an association of more than 100 insurers, including Cigna Corp., Allianz Versicherungs AG of West Germany and Britain's Commercial Union Assurance PLC. 
13/wsj_1302:Lloyd's has endured decades of genteel decline.
13/wsj_1302:At the peak of its power and influence a century ago, Lloyd's dominated the insurance world with a 50% stake.
13/wsj_1302:Today, Lloyd's share of the world market, excluding life insurance, is about 2%. (Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included.) Bigger rivals, such as Aetna and Allianz, backed by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches, operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates, brokers say.
13/wsj_1302:Though Lloyd's pioneered such now-standard policies as worker's compensation insurance, burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses, and bankers' liability insurance, competitors now underwrite most of that business. 
13/wsj_1302:Beyond that, many big oil, chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through "captive" offshore companies for industry-specific coverage.
13/wsj_1302:Only 10 years ago, for instance, Lloyd's was the pre-eminent insurer of thoroughbred horses.
13/wsj_1302:But since 1981, Kirk Horse Insurance Inc. of Lexington, Ky. has grabbed a 20% stake of the market. 
13/wsj_1302:Thus, he asserts, Lloyd's can't react quickly to competition. "Lloyd's has lost control of the situation," he says. "They aren't controlling their destiny like they used to." 
13/wsj_1302:Lloyd's, he says, is cut off from "the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a steadying influence" against catastrophic losses.
13/wsj_1302:By that, he means low-margin but low-risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance.
13/wsj_1302:Three years ago, the exchange took up residence in a space-age tower of steel and glass -- evocative of the kind of modern architecture that Britain's Prince Charles has denounced. (Some exchange wags call the building "the oil rig.") But along with such treasured artifacts as Lord Nelson's spyglass, Lloyd's also brought its outmoded ways of doing business. 
13/wsj_1302:Lloyd's vast trading hall houses a warren of well-polished desks.
13/wsj_1302:Sandwiched between desks, underwriters sit on benches surrounded by stacks of policies.
13/wsj_1302:A broker may have to approach as many as 20 underwriters who insure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicates.
13/wsj_1302:The magnitude of the exchange's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims.
13/wsj_1302:That year, it posted record pretax profit of #650 million, a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims. 
13/wsj_1302:Insurance analysts say the exchange's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $600 million in aviation losses (including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie, Scotland) and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September's Hurricane Hugo. 
13/wsj_1302:Lloyd's says the departures of names isn't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity, currently about #11 billion.
13/wsj_1302:Mr. Lawrence says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names.
13/wsj_1302:Mr. Wetherell, the underwriter, reckons half of his business could be transacted by computer, cutting costs at least 10%.
13/wsj_1302:But such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters, brokers and administrators before being implemented.
13/wsj_1303:Yoshitoki Chino retains his title of chairman of Daiwa, Japan's second-largest securities firm.
13/wsj_1303:In Japanese firms, the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations, while the chairman's role is more a ceremonial one.
13/wsj_1303:The title of chief executive officer isn't used. 
13/wsj_1303:While people within Daiwa, particularly internationalists, expected that Mr. Dozen, 52, would eventually become Daiwa's president, the speed of his promotion surprised many.
13/wsj_1303:Mr. Dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing. 
13/wsj_1303:Daiwa is one of the world's largest securities firms.
13/wsj_1303:As of March 31, the Daiwa group had shareholder equity of 801.21 billion yen ($5.64 billion).
13/wsj_1303:For the six months ended Sept. 30, Daiwa reported unconsolidated (parent company) net income of 79.03 billion yen ($556.5 million) on revenue of 332.38 billion yen ($2.34 billion).
13/wsj_1303:Several observers interpreted Mr. Dozen's appointment as an attempt by Daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of Japan's domestic markets, which should mean increased competition. 
13/wsj_1303:All of Japan's so-called Big Four securities firms -- Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., the world's largest, Nikko Securities Co. Ltd., Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd. and Daiwa -- have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets.
13/wsj_1303:And while the Japanese have stepped up their purchases of U.S. shares in the past several months, they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors. 
13/wsj_1303:When he arrived in the U.S. in 1969 -- the start of an eight-year tour -- he tried selling Japanese yen-denominated bonds to U.S. investors. "He made desperate efforts, using the yellow pages from beginning to end," said Koji Yoneyama, president of Daiwa's U.S. unit. "But not a single piece of paper was sold." 
13/wsj_1303:In an interview a few months ago, he recalled how after some training at Salomon Brothers Inc., he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of 20 U.S. corporate bond issues.
13/wsj_1303:In his climb to the top, Mr. Dozen also headed the company's stock-exchange division, its fixed-income units and its international operations. "He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience; he is very well-balanced," said Takuro Isoda, chairman of Daiwa's U.S. unit in New York. 
13/wsj_1303:Commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of Japanese securities companies' earnings.
13/wsj_1303:And anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force "would be fragile," said a Daiwa executive. 
13/wsj_1303:If Mr. Dozen has a weakness, it may be his golf game. "He digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball, like a farmer," said Mr. Yoneyama. 
13/wsj_1304:The nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 20 cents and said it may buy back as much as 4.8% of its common outstanding. 
13/wsj_1304:Some analysts said Inco, which had cash reserves of $272 million as of Sept. 30, could still announce a special dividend in the next few months, though it would be smaller than the $10-a-share special dividend it paid last year. 
13/wsj_1304:The quarterly dividend is payable Dec. 1 to shares of record Nov. 3. 
13/wsj_1304:Inco said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company's Manitoba operations due to high levels of arsenic in the ore. 
13/wsj_1304:Under a previous buyback program, Inco has purchased 1.7 million of its shares since April. 
13/wsj_1305:UAL Corp. 's board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out, saying United Airlines' parent should remain independent for now. 
13/wsj_1305:As a result, UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company. 
13/wsj_1305:The two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters, including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility. 
13/wsj_1305:UAL, which had risen $9.875 to $178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group, reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement. 
13/wsj_1305:Among the first trades reported by the securities firm of Jefferies & Co., which makes a market in UAL after the exchange is closed, were 10,000 shares at $170, 6,000 shares at $162, 2,500 at $162, and 10,000 at $158. 
13/wsj_1305:Twelve of UAL's outside directors met at a five-hour meeting yesterday in Chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid.
13/wsj_1305:The board said it concluded that "the welfare of the company, its shareholders, its employees and the broader public . . . can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong, viable, independent company." 
13/wsj_1305:That contract was tied to the success of the buy-out.
13/wsj_1305:The machinists' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks' interest in financing the transaction. 
13/wsj_1305:The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. Wolf, but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union.
13/wsj_1305:They paid $15 million for a 1% stake and received an additional 9% of the company at no additional cost. 
13/wsj_1305:Until the collapse of this bid, Mr. Wolf was regarded as one of the nation's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines. 
13/wsj_1305:But he and his chief financial officer, John Pope, sowed some of the seeds for the deal's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates, while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $114.3 million they stood to gain from sale of their UAL stock and options. 
13/wsj_1305:It also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits. 
13/wsj_1306:Tandy said its experience during the shortage didn't merit the $5 million to $50 million investment U.S. Memories is seeking from each investor. "At this time, we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need {for DRAMs} from the market as a rule," said Ed Juge, Tandy's director of market planning. 
13/wsj_1306:But "they weren't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it." 
13/wsj_1306:Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June, when the group was formed by seven electronics companies: Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment Corp.; Hewlett-Packard Co.; Intel Corp.; International Business Machines Corp.; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp. 
13/wsj_1307:In a startling turnabout, Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them.
13/wsj_1307:David Boren, the Intelligence Committee chairman, is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration suggesting that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination. 
13/wsj_1307:But there's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue.
13/wsj_1307:And if Congress is going to assume authority to micromanage foreign policy, it's going to have to take some of the responsibility too. 
13/wsj_1307:The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega.
13/wsj_1307:When they did, his commanders didn't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads.
13/wsj_1307:But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by Congress? 
13/wsj_1307:Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning: You have the right to conceal your coup intentions, because we may rat on you.
13/wsj_1307:The CIA's Deputy Director of Operations, Richard Stoltz, tried to smooth things over a few days later, but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster's point. "The interpretation" of the executive order, Mr. Stoltz said, "and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it, has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators, including me." In other words, Congress won't let the CIA do much of anything anymore, and that's fine with the CIA.
13/wsj_1307:And of course, doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties.
13/wsj_1307:Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North.
13/wsj_1307:The Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Senator William Cohen, joined with Senator George Mitchell to write a best seller about Iran-Contra, deploring "Men of Zeal." No doubt many people in the CIA, the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it.
13/wsj_1307:What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who've read all this and know what can happen if they fail?
13/wsj_1307:The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set, a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action.
13/wsj_1307:There are of course good reasons the U.S. shouldn't get into the assassination business, but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars.
13/wsj_1307:Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him. 
13/wsj_1308:Both have been raised at least 30% in recent years, even while the price of gasoline has fallen.
13/wsj_1309:A series of explosions tore through the huge Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics plant near here, injuring more than a hundred and closing parts of the Houston Ship Channel. 
13/wsj_1309:There were no immediate reports of deaths, but officials said a number of workers were still unaccounted for last night. 
13/wsj_1309:The Bartlesville, Okla., oil company late yesterday still hadn't said officially what caused the explosions and fires, which sent columns of heavy black smoke billowing high into the air.
13/wsj_1309:One local Phillips manager said a seal blew in one of the plant's reactors.
13/wsj_1309:Glenn Cox, Phillips' president and chief operating officer, and other Phillips officials flew from Bartlesville to assess the damage and determine the cause of the afternoon explosions. 
13/wsj_1309:The plastics plant is located on an 800-acre tract in the heart of the petrochemical corridor that reaches along the U.S. Gulf Coast.
13/wsj_1309:The U.S. Coast Guard closed six miles of the Houston Ship Channel, where about 150 companies have operations, because the thick, black smoke obscured the area.
13/wsj_1309:The Port of Houston closed its terminal for handling bulk cargo. 
13/wsj_1309:The number working at the time of the blast wasn't known. 
13/wsj_1309:The Phillips facility manufactures polyethylene, polypropylene and K-resin, plastics used in a wide array of applications, including milk jugs and toys.
13/wsj_1309:Plastics are the cornerstone of Phillips' chemicals operations, which is the biggest single contributor to the company's profits. 
13/wsj_1310:A federal judge in Manhattan has entered a judgment requiring a Chicago organized crime figure to pay the government $250,000, representing alleged profits he gained from his involvement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. 
13/wsj_1310:Joseph Lombardo, who the government alleged was the "captain" of organized crime in Chicago, was one of numerous defendants in the government's sweeping racketeering suit against the Teamsters.
13/wsj_1310:In the suit, filed in June 1988, the government accused the union's leadership of depriving its 1.6 million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering.
13/wsj_1310:Mr. Lombardo, the last of the defendants to settle the suit, agreed to pay the government the $250,000 within one week. 
13/wsj_1311:Exxon Corp. said its third-quarter earnings slipped 9% as profits from two of its three major businesses sagged.
13/wsj_1311:Although Exxon spent heavily during the latest quarter to clean up the Alaskan shoreline blackened by its huge oil spill, those expenses as well as the cost of a continuing spill-related program are covered by $880 million in charges taken during the first half. 
13/wsj_1311:An Exxon official said that at this time the oil company doesn't anticipate any additional charges to future earnings relating to the cleanup of oil spilled when one of its tankers rammed into an underwater reef.
13/wsj_1311:She added, however, that charges already taken don't take into account the potential effect of litigation involving the oil spill.
13/wsj_1311:During the third quarter, Exxon purchased 8.34 million shares of its stock at a cost of $373 million.
13/wsj_1311:Exxon's profitability, like that of many other oil companies, was hurt during the third quarter by declining returns from the chemicals and refining and marketing businesses.
13/wsj_1311:He estimates that the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, was $4.04 a barrel higher during the third quarter of this year than in the same period last year. 
13/wsj_1311:A rash of one-time charges left Ashland Oil with a loss of $39 million for its fiscal fourth quarter.
13/wsj_1311:The Ashland, Ky., oil company reported a $38 million charge resulting from settlement of a 10-year dispute with the National Iranian Oil Co. over claims that Ashland didn't pay for Iranian crude it had received.
13/wsj_1311:Ashland also took a $25 million after-tax charge to cover anticipated costs to correct problems with boilers built by one of its subsidiaries.
13/wsj_1311:The oil refiner also booked a $15 million charge for selling Ashland Technology Corp., one of its subsidiaries, at a loss. 
13/wsj_1311:Hess's earnings were up despite a $30 million charge to cover the cost of maintaining operations after Hurricane Hugo heavily damaged the company's refinery at St. Croix.
13/wsj_1311:Shrinking profit margins in chemical and refining and marketing sectors accounted for most of the decline, said Chairman C.J. Silas in a statement.
13/wsj_1311:Despite higher oil prices, exploration and production profits were off because of foreign-currency losses and some construction costs incurred in one of Phillips' North Sea oil fields.
13/wsj_1311:The latest quarter included an after-tax gain of $71 million from non-recurring items.
13/wsj_1311:The latest period included a $54 million gain from the sale of various oil and gas properties, a $22 million charge from the restructuring of Occidental's domestic oil and gas operations, and tax credits of $42 million.
13/wsj_1311:Both periods included non-recurring charges of $3 million for early retirement of debt. 
13/wsj_1311:The latest period includes net gains of $32 million in non-recurring credits from the sale of properties, indicating operating losses for the quarter in the oil and gas division.
13/wsj_1311:Chemical earnings fell 10%, reflecting softening of demand. 
13/wsj_1311:For the nine months, Arco reported net income of $1.6 billion, or $8.87 a share, up 33% from $1.2 billion, or $6.56 a share a year earlier.
13/wsj_1312:Imo Industries Inc. -- $150 million of senior subordinated debentures due 2001, priced at par to yield 12%.
13/wsj_1312:San Antonio, Texas -- $575 million of electric and gas system revenue refunding bonds, Series 1989, 1989A and 1989B, tentatively priced by a First Boston Corp. group to yield from 6.15% in 1991 to 7.30% in 2009.
13/wsj_1312:There are about $100 million of 7% term bonds due 2009, priced to yield 7.30%, which is the issue's high yield.
13/wsj_1312:There are also about $124 million of 6 1/2% bonds priced to yield 7.25% in 2012; about $97 million of 6% bonds priced to yield 7.20% in 2014; and about $26.5 million of 5% bonds priced to yield 7.15% in 2016.
13/wsj_1312:All of the term bonds are original issue discount bonds, according to the lead underwriter.
13/wsj_1312:Maryland Stadium Authority -- $137.6 million of sports facilities lease revenue bonds, Series 1989 D, due 1992-1999, 2004, 2009 and 2019, tentatively priced at par by a Morgan Stanley group to yield from 6.35% in 1992 to 7.60% in 2019.
13/wsj_1312:There are $15,845,000 of 7 3/8% bonds priced at par and due 2004; $22,985,000 of 7 1/2% bonds priced at par and due 2009; and $82.6 million of 7.60% bonds priced at par and due 2019.
13/wsj_1312:Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. -- $250 million of Remic mortgage securities being offered in 11 classes by Morgan Stanley.
13/wsj_1312:Federal National Mortgage Association -- $500 million of Remic mortgage securities being offered in 10 classes by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
13/wsj_1312:Separately, a $400 million issue of Fannie Mae Remic mortgage securities is being offered in 15 classes by Bear, Stearns & Co.
13/wsj_1312:Finally, a $300 million issue of Fannie Mae Remic mortgage securities is being offered in 12 classes by Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
13/wsj_1312:Credit Agricole (CNCA) (French) -- $250 million of 8 3/4% bonds due Nov. 21, 1994, priced at 101.80 to yield 8.77% annually less full fees, via IBJ International Ltd. Fees 1 7/8. 
13/wsj_1312:Hokuriku Electric Power Co. (Japan) -- $200 million of 8 7/8% bonds due Nov. 20, 1996, priced at 101 3/4 to yield 8.90% less full fees, via Yamaichi International (Europe) Ltd. Fees 1 7/8.

13/wsj_1312:Royal Bank of Canada, Grand Cayman branch (Canada) -- 100 million Canadian dollars of 10 3/4% deposit notes due Nov. 30, 1994, priced at 101 3/4 to yield 10.78% less full fees, via RBC Dominion Securities International Ltd. Fees 1 7/8. 
13/wsj_1312:Union Bank of Finland -- 100 million Australian dollars of 9% bonds due Nov. 9, 1990, priced at 94 to yield 17.20% less full fees, via Banque Paribas Capital Markets Ltd. Fees 1.
13/wsj_1312:Ford Motor Credit -- $2.57 billion of certificates backed by automobile loans with a coupon rate of 8.70%, priced at 99 19/32 to yield 8.903% through an underwriting group headed by First Boston Corp.
13/wsj_1312:The issue is the first by Ford Motor Credit, a unit of Ford Motor Co., and the second largest in the four-year history of the $45 billion asset-backed market.
13/wsj_1312:The largest issue was a $4 billion offering of auto-loan securities by General Motors Acceptance Corp. in 1986.
13/wsj_1312:The Ford issue, through Ford Credit 1989-A Grantor Trust, was priced at a yield spread of 95 basis points above the Treasury 7 3/4% issue due July 1991.
13/wsj_1312:The offering is rated doubleA-2 by Moody's and double-A by S&P, based on the quality of the underlying auto loans and a guarantee covering 9% of the deal from Ford Motor Credit.
13/wsj_1312:The certificates have an estimated average life of 1.8 years, assuming monthly prepayments at 1.3% of the original balance.
13/wsj_1313:The premiere of "Showdown," with Mr. Downey and Richard G. Carter, a columnist with the New York Daily News, is scheduled for Dec. 4 at 8 p.m. CNBC is available to 13 million cable households. 
13/wsj_1313:Michael Eskridge, president of CNBC, said that although there will be a studio audience, viewers will no longer have to endure the shouting of "Mort! Mort! Mort!" But just how does Mr. Downey's unorthodox style mesh with the sedate tone of CNBC's business programming? 
13/wsj_1313:"Ninety percent of Mort's old show fits into our style," said Mr. Eskridge. "That is consumer issues." 
13/wsj_1314:Investors dumped stocks of big companies whose earnings fluctuate with the economy. 
13/wsj_1314:Many of those "cyclical" issues are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell 26.23 to 2662.91.
13/wsj_1314:Analysts say that the selling of cyclical stocks yesterday will be followed by a sell-off in shares of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets.
13/wsj_1314:In an economic slowdown, heavy debt loads reduce the flexibility of companies because cash that would normally be used to keep the company buoyant must be diverted to interest payments. 
13/wsj_1314:Among the 30 Dow industrials, they bought McDonald's, Coca-Cola Co. and Procter & Gamble and sold Aluminum Co. of America.
13/wsj_1314:In another sign of slowdown fears, investors dumped technology shares. 
13/wsj_1314:Many money managers are bracing for a decline in stocks of companies with big debt loads on their balance sheets. "The junk bond market is being taken apart" because of recession fears, said J. David Mills, senior vice president at Boston Company Advisers. "Under this scrutiny, the first thing you do is sell your cyclical stocks and the second thing you do is sell your over-leveraged companies." 
13/wsj_1314:In fact, much of the buying in blue chips yesterday was a pursuit of companies with lower debt levels.
13/wsj_1314:In a recent investment letter entitled "Winners of the `Leverage Wars, ' " Edward Kerschner, chairman of PaineWebber's investment policy committee, suggested that investors buy stocks of companies that have avoided loading up on debt. 
13/wsj_1314:He suggested that investors buy the shares of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea, J. Baker, McDonald's, Philip Morris and Sara Lee.
13/wsj_1314:He said that all of these companies will be able to compete fiercely in an economic downturn.
13/wsj_1314:McDonald's has long-term debt equaling 91% of shareholder equity currently, but Mr. Kerschner said the company is carrying real estate assets at about $2.6 billion below their real value. 
13/wsj_1314:According to Salomon Brothers' "stub" stock index of 20 companies whose debt is giant compared with shareholder equity, investors are already beginning to retreat from shares of debt-laden companies.
13/wsj_1314:From January to early September, the index of stub stocks -- the tiny portion of equity that's publicly traded following a recapitalization -- outperformed Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by about 20%.
13/wsj_1314:"Stocks that have a high default risk have started to underperform those stocks that have a lower default risk," said Eric Sorenson, director of quantitative analysis at Salomon Brothers. "Companies that have the most exposure to the business cycle have underperformed since late last summer." 
13/wsj_1314:Union Carbide, whose third-quarter earnings dropped about 35% from a year earlier and fell short of analysts' expectations, declined 1/2 to 24 1/2.
13/wsj_1314:Other weak blue-chip issues included Chevron, which went down 2 to 64 7/8 in Big Board composite trading of 1.3 million shares; Goodyear Tire & Rubber, off 1 1/2 to 46 3/4, and American Express, down 3/4 to 37 1/4.
13/wsj_1314:Pinnacle West Capital, whose earnings have been hurt by continued problems at its MeraBank unit, fell 1 5/8 to 9 1/8 on 2.1 million shares to lead the Big Board's list of most active issues.
13/wsj_1314:After declining about 41% last week, UAL advanced 9 7/8 to 178 3/8 on 1.1 million shares on anticipation of a revised takeover offer from a labor-management group for the parent company of United Airlines.
13/wsj_1314:Ramada gained 7/8 to 11 1/4 after revamping the terms of its restructuring plan, which calls for the company to sell its hotel operations for $540 million and spin off its casino business to shareholders.
13/wsj_1314:The revision follows last month's withdrawal of a $400 million junk-bond offering for the new casino company, Aztar Corp. 
13/wsj_1314:USA Today reported that the Rales brothers, Washington, D.C.-based investors who made an unsuccessful offer to acquire Interco last year, have bought nearly 3% of Mead's common shares. 
13/wsj_1315:"Hacksaw" and "Bonecrusher" are the sort of nicknames normally associated with linebackers and heavyweight contenders.
13/wsj_1315:Who'd have thought that the next group of tough guys carrying around reputations like that would be school superintendents? 
13/wsj_1315:In New York City, the new Chancellor, Joseph Fernandez, has landed like a 16-inch shell in the middle of a system that has been impervious to serious reform. 
13/wsj_1315:Both men fit the mood of the times -- the mood being one of a public fed up with officials' rationalizations for why their schools don't work. 
13/wsj_1315:Former Patterson, N.J., principal Joe Clark was no doubt the general public's first experience with this new breed of no-nonsense administrator.
13/wsj_1315:The subject of the movie "Lean on Me," Mr. Clark controlled his school with a bullhorn and a baseball bat.
13/wsj_1315:He may have gone overboard in his pursuit of good discipline, but isn't it interesting that some of the country's biggest, most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel-chewing mold?
13/wsj_1315:Elena Scambio, the woman assigned to run the Jersey City school system that was taken over by the state, says her top priority will be to "cut through the dead hand of bureaucracy." 
13/wsj_1315:He's attacked the concept of "building tenure," one of the most disgraceful institutions in American public schools.
13/wsj_1315:We suggest that Mr. Fernandez find an incompetent principal, toss him out of the building and let the forces of the status quo explain to the parents whatever it is they're defending.
13/wsj_1315:He takes over a school system in the midst of radical reform.
13/wsj_1315:This of course led to disaster in New York City.
13/wsj_1315:Getting a community of parents to care again about its schools is essential, but in Chicago the new boards will make mistakes and Mr. Kimbrough will have to identify them. 
13/wsj_1315:The rise of superintendents such as Joseph Fernandez and Ted Kimbrough suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems.
13/wsj_1315:The schools' central mission, educating children, became subsumed by the competing interests of bureaucrats, politicians and unions.
13/wsj_1315:The classroom itself operated on the periphery of this awful system, discipline collapsed, and kids stopped learning. 
13/wsj_1315:Until then, it's clear that some of the people who've been keeping big-city schools down are going to be dealing with the Terminator. 
13/wsj_1316:As part of the agreement, Goodson also terminated the contract under which Ingersoll manages Goodson's 66 newspapers, ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently.
13/wsj_1316:Goodson has accused Ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the St. Louis Sun. 
13/wsj_1316:Under the terms of the accord, Ingersoll will pay about $255 million for the Register, a daily that Goodson bought for about $170 million in 1986.
13/wsj_1316:Goodson will pay the additional $20 million in settlement of the management contract.
13/wsj_1316:Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers.
13/wsj_1316:Goodson, which is based here, will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $155 million in 1987.
13/wsj_1316:The New Jersey paper, like the New Haven, Conn., paper, was purchased by Ingersoll on Goodson's behalf as part of the management contract.
13/wsj_1316:Investment bankers familiar with the company said Goodson is seeking a new bank credit line of $190 million and may have to sell additional newspapers. 
13/wsj_1316:David N. Hurwitz, president and chief operating officer of Goodson, said in a telephone interview that the company doesn't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers. 
13/wsj_1316:Goodson said David Carr, former president of Ingersoll Publications, and Ray Cockburn, former senior vice president, would head the new in-house management team at Goodson, which had revenue of $225 million in 1988. 
13/wsj_1316:The latter's son, Ralph Ingersoll Jr., took over the company and has been managing the Goodson properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for Goodson.
13/wsj_1316:Ingersoll President Robert M. Jelenic said in a statement that the company is "delighted by the conclusion of the Goodson relationship" and will be able to "concentrate all our energies" on Ingersoll's own papers.
13/wsj_1317:Mr. Freeman said in August that he would retire by the end of this year to take "executive responsibility" for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker Edmond Safra.
13/wsj_1317:American Express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. Safra.
13/wsj_1317:The agency, under his direction, bitterly fought a takeover attempt by WPP Group PLC of London before succumbing in May.
13/wsj_1317:And although Mr. Roman and WPP's chief executive, Martin Sorrell, have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other, people close to Mr. Roman say he was unhappy giving up control of the company.
13/wsj_1317:Some executives also cite tension because of efforts by Mr. Sorrell, a financial man, to cut costs at the agency. 
13/wsj_1317:Mr. Roman will be succeeded as the head of Ogilvy's flagship ad agency, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, by Graham Phillips, 50, who had been president of North American operations and who, like Mr. Sorrell, is British.
13/wsj_1317:Alexander Brody, 56, will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations.
13/wsj_1317:He had been president of the international operations.
13/wsj_1317:Moreover, after 26 years at Ogilvy he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident.
13/wsj_1317:He also is close to American Express's chairman and chief executive officer, James D. Robinson III. Aside from working with Mr. Robinson on the American Express advertising account for about 11 years, Mr. Roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. Robinson. 
13/wsj_1317:The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that Mr. Roman had been pushed out of Ogilvy's top spot by Mr. Sorrell.
13/wsj_1317:But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation, saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay, offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine (The wine, naturally, was Seagram's brand, an Ogilvy client). "He asked me not to resign.
13/wsj_1317:"I'm the guy who made him head of New York, head of the U.S., president of North America, and recommended him {to Mr. Sorrell} as my successor.
13/wsj_1317:He labeled reports of friction "ridiculous," and said that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips's boat in Connecticut. 
13/wsj_1317:He also will sit on the company's corporate planning and policy committee, made up of the top corporate and operating executives. 
13/wsj_1317:American Express, Kraft General Foods, and Mattel executives said the move won't affect their relationships with the ad agency. "General Foods's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies' work, and will continue to be," said David Hurwitt, a vice president of Kraft General Foods. 
13/wsj_1317:But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. Phillips isn't as well-known to many clients. "Ken was my key contact," said J. Nicholas Hahn, president and chief executive officer of Cotton Inc., which represents cotton producers. "I don't know {Mr.
13/wsj_1317:While the agency has done well in many parts of the world, its flagship New York office has had a dismal track record recently; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones, including Maxwell House. "I think {Mr.
13/wsj_1317:Sale of Saatchi Unit Close 
13/wsj_1317:But David Lord, managing editor of Consultants News, an industry publication based in Fitzwilliam, N.H., said an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times Cleveland Consulting's approximately $15 million annual revenue. 
13/wsj_1317:Both Saatchi & Saatchi, which announced its intention to sell off most of its consulting business in June, and Cleveland Consulting declined to comment on the proposed sale. 
13/wsj_1317:Details of the commercial, which will be part of the brand's 1990 advertising campaign, weren't disclosed.
13/wsj_1317:Mr. John becomes the latest of many music stars, including George Michael and Whitney Houston, to appear in ads for the diet drink. 
13/wsj_1318:The operator of cable-television networks said the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner Broadcasting's Turner Network Television channel, or TNT, and then will be released internationally in movie theaters. 
13/wsj_1318:The unit's first two offerings are slated to be "The Secret Life of Ian Fleming," a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the James Bond novels, and "Treasure Island," produced by Charlton Heston, who also stars in the movie. 
13/wsj_1318:Ted Turner, Turner Broadcasting's chairman, was named chairman of Turner Pictures, and Gerry Hogan, president of Turner Entertainment Networks, was named president of the unit. 
13/wsj_1318:Mr. Hogan said "The Secret Life of Ian Fleming" and "Treasure Island" cost more than $6 million each to make, which is only about one-third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release. 
13/wsj_1318:The Turner move is in line with a cable-TV trend toward more original programming -- and toward finding more ways to amortize the high cost of producing films.
13/wsj_1319:Financiere de Paribas said it intends to bid for one of France's other large financial and industrial holding companies, Cie. de Navigation Mixte. 
13/wsj_1319:Its cash-or-shares bid values Navigation Mixte at about 22.82 billion francs ($3.62 billion), making this one of France's largest-ever attempted takeovers.
13/wsj_1319:The cost of buying the additional 48% stake would be 10.95 billion francs ($1.74 billion). 
13/wsj_1319:It also would make Paribas a major French ally of West Germany's Allianz AG insurance group. 
13/wsj_1319:Moreover, Suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of Societe Generale de Belgique. 
13/wsj_1319:Although Paribas Chairman Michel Francois-Poncet wouldn't rule out eventually selling all of Navigation Mixte's insurance operations to Allianz, he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate. 
13/wsj_1319:Alternatively, it said it would offer three Paribas shares, themselves eligible for dividends as of next Jan. 1, for one Navigation Mixte share.
13/wsj_1319:Paribas shares closed down 30 francs at 610 francs, and Navigation Mixte shares were suspended at 1,800 francs pending the outcome of the bid. 
13/wsj_1319:Paribas said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it.
13/wsj_1319:This is one of the first bids under new takeover rules aimed at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes. 
13/wsj_1319:He told reporters he had information that Mr. Fournier was preparing to buy as much as 20% of Paribas, up from less than 5% currently. 
13/wsj_1320:Crude oil futures prices fell further as analysts and traders said OPEC oil producers aren't putting the brakes on output ahead of the traditionally weak first quarter. 
13/wsj_1320:Analysts pointed to reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of 20.5 million barrels a day, with some accounts putting the 13-nation group's output as high as 23 million barrels a day. 
13/wsj_1320:That level of production didn't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter, when demand is traditionally strong.
13/wsj_1320:But because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year, several market participants say, OPEC production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further.
13/wsj_1320:With prices already headed lower, news of a series of explosions at a major Phillips Petroleum Co. chemical facility on the Houston Ship Channel also was bearish for prices.
13/wsj_1320:Even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude, analysts say, now the facility won't need any, at a time of already high availability. 
13/wsj_1320:Dozens of workers were injured, authorities said.
13/wsj_1320:There was no immediate estimate of damage from the company. 
13/wsj_1320:London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons; expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons.
13/wsj_1320:The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $1.23-a-pound level, selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in.
13/wsj_1320:Mr. Savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar, which would normally support the U.S. copper market.
13/wsj_1320:Copper has been stuck in a trading range of $1.19 to $1.34.
13/wsj_1320:Mr. Savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $1.04. 
13/wsj_1320:PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum and palladium struggled to maintain their prices all day despite news stories over the weekend that recent cold fusion experiments, which use both metals, showed signs of producing extra heat.
13/wsj_1320:He said the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again.
13/wsj_1320:Also weighing on both metals' prices is the role of the chief supplier, the Soviet Union.
13/wsj_1320:On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for November delivery closed at $5.63 a bushel, down half a cent, while the December wheat contract rose three-quarters of a cent to $4.0775 a bushel.
13/wsj_1320:Supporting prices was the announcement late Friday of additional grain sales to the Soviet Union.
13/wsj_1320:But acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the Farm Belt.
13/wsj_1320:For the past week or so, traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar, and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan.
13/wsj_1320:But with no reports of either country actually entering the market, analysts said, futures prices became vulnerable.
13/wsj_1320:Developing countries such as India, some analysts said, seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range, around 14.75 cents, and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range, around 13.50 cents.
13/wsj_1320:But Erik Dunlaevy, a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd., said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler: Speculators, he said, "got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs." A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption, sugar isn't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country. 
13/wsj_1320:At such prices, according to Mr. Savaiko, bargain hunting and short-covering -- buying back of contracts previously sold -- by speculators isn't uncommon.
13/wsj_1320:He also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in New York as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move.
13/wsj_1320:Sandra Kaul, research analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the Ivory Coast, a major cocoa producer. 
13/wsj_1321:Rockwell International Corp. bought out Ikegai Corp. 's interest in Ikegai-Goss, a joint venture of the two companies based in Tokyo.
13/wsj_1321:The purchase was made by Rockwell Graphic Systems, a Chicago subsidiary of the El Segundo, Calif., concern. 
13/wsj_1322:Early in the day, bonds rose modestly on economists' forecasts that this week's slate of economic data will portray an economy headed for trouble.
13/wsj_1322:For example, today the Department of Commerce is scheduled to release the September durable goods report.
13/wsj_1322:The consensus forecast of 14 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report is for a 1.2% drop in September orders.
13/wsj_1322:Prices of high-yield, high-risk corporate securities ended unchanged. 
13/wsj_1322:In more evidence of the growing division between "good" and "bad" junk bonds, a $150 million issue by Imo Industries Inc. was snapped up by investors while underwriters for Beatrice Co. 's $350 million issue are considering restructuring the deal to attract buyers. 
13/wsj_1322:"On the negative side, the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market," said William M. Brachfeld, economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. "On the other hand, we have economic news that is {expected to be} relatively positive for the bond market.
13/wsj_1322:Today, the Treasury will sell $10 billion of new two-year notes.
13/wsj_1322:Tomorrow, Resolution Funding Corp., a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation's troubled thrifts, will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds. 
13/wsj_1322:While some say the auction should proceed smoothly, others contend that yesterday's sale of $2.58 billion of asset-backed securities by Ford Motor Credit Corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government's note sale. 
13/wsj_1322:The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market's four-year history.
13/wsj_1322:The issue yields 8.90% and carries a guarantee covering 9% of the deal from the company.
13/wsj_1322:The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 3/32, compared with 101 17/32 Friday.
13/wsj_1322:The Treasury sold $7.81 billion of three-month bills with an average discount rate of 7.52%, the highest since the average of 7.63% at the auction on Oct. 10.
13/wsj_1322:The $7.81 billion of six-month Treasury bills were sold with an average discount rate of 7.50%, the highest since the average of 7.60% at the Oct. 10 auction. 
13/wsj_1322:In the junk bond market, Imo Industries' issue of 12-year debentures, considered to be one of the market's high-quality credits, was priced at par to yield 12%. 
13/wsj_1322:Morgan Stanley is expected to price another junk bond deal, $350 million of senior subordinated debentures by Continental Cablevision Inc., next Tuesday. 
13/wsj_1322:In light of the recent skittishness in the high-yield market, junk bond analysts and traders expect other high-yield deals to be sweetened or restructured before they are offered to investors. 
13/wsj_1322:In the case of Beatrice, Salomon Brothers Inc. is considering restructuring the reset mechanism on the $200 million portion of the offering.
13/wsj_1322:Under the originally contemplated terms of the offering, the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above Treasurys.
13/wsj_1322:Under the new plan being considered, the notes would reset annually at a rate to maintain a market value of 101.
13/wsj_1322:Price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced at a yield of between 13 1/4% and 13 1/2%. 
13/wsj_1322:Activity in derivative markets was strong with four new real estate mortgage investment conduits announced and talk of several more deals in today's session. 
13/wsj_1322:The Federal National Mortgage Association offered $1.2 billion of Remic securities in three issues, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. offered a $250 million Remic backed by 9% 15-year securities. 
13/wsj_1322:Part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that underwriters are repackaging mortgage securities being sold by thrifts.
13/wsj_1322:The refunding issue, which had been in the wings for two months, was one of the chief offerings overhanging the market and limiting price appreciation.
13/wsj_1322:The benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at a price of 95.39, off 0.28.
13/wsj_1322:West German bond prices ended lower after a day of aimless trading.
13/wsj_1322:The benchmark 11 3/4% Treasury bond due 2003/2007 rose 1/8 to 111 21/32 to yield 10.11%, while the 12% issue of 1995 rose 3/32 to 103 23/32 to yield 11.01%. 
13/wsj_1323:Right now he takes people out to fish in the bays behind the barrier islands that curve for hundreds of miles along the eastern coast of Texas, enclosing milky green lagoons behind ridges of sand and grassy scrub that rim the deep blue of the Gulf beyond. 
13/wsj_1323:There have been three days of hot, wind-swept rain, and now with the first sun we are after speckled seatrout, which with redfish provides most of the game fishing hereabouts.
13/wsj_1323:The fish often are plentiful around the pilings of the old gas wells that dot the flat surface like the remains of sunken ships.
13/wsj_1323:We cruise toward another set of pilings.
13/wsj_1323:The radio queries again. "Pickin' one or two," says the guide, chuckling. "You can tell they've got nothin'." A pair of black skimmers zig-zag past close to the surface.
13/wsj_1323:Soon we have our limit of the shimmering fish stippled in rose-gold and black.
13/wsj_1323:This must be the last big stretch of the American seacoast that is "undeveloped." There are a few ramshackle fishing towns with quiet atolls of resort houses nearby.
13/wsj_1323:Jutting out just to the north of us is the Blackjack Peninsula (after the oak, not the game) which forms the core of the Aransas Wildlife Refuge.
13/wsj_1323:It is famous as the winter home of the whooping crane, that symbol of the destruction of wild America.
13/wsj_1323:The peninsula comes off the vast southeastern alluvial plain with fields of rice and cotton and sorghum as far as the eye can see.
13/wsj_1323:Near the coast there are dense coverts of live oak interspersed with marshes and prairies.
13/wsj_1323:Above the blossoms of lantana and scarlet pea the inky-brown and golden palamedes butterfly floats on its lazy wingbeat. 
13/wsj_1323:Inland a few miles from the refuge there is a place called Tivoli, with a white church, a gas station and a grocery, the houses relatively close together for such a settlement in these parts. "Tivoli Motel," I read a sign in the usual pronunciation of the name as we whoosh through. "Here in south Texas we say Tie-vole-ee," my host gently corrects. 
13/wsj_1323:Mr. King is the director of the Foreign Press Center in New York. 
13/wsj_1324:The joint venture will have nominal capital of 50 million marks ($26.9 million) and 700 employees.
13/wsj_1325:The company, which supplies transmissions and other drive-train parts to auto makers, said about half the earnings drop came from the "virtual collapse" of the Venezuelan auto industry.
13/wsj_1326:Norimasa Furuta, president of Japan's Mazda Motor Corp., said the Japanese car maker is planning joint production with Ford Motor Co. in Europe ahead of the European Community's 1992 integration. 
13/wsj_1326:Mr. Furuta didn't disclose further details of the arrangement at a news conference, but said the project would be undertaken with Ford's European subsidiary. 
13/wsj_1327:It is the stuff of dreams, but also of traumas.
13/wsj_1327:Her bare breasts, her dancing, her voice, her beauty and, perhaps most famously, her derriere, were prominent attractions, but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible.
13/wsj_1327:Bricktop, another American black woman who found a measure of fame in Paris, said: "I don't think I've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life, or whose life was more complicated than Josephine's." 
13/wsj_1327:Baker had lots of them.
13/wsj_1327:She adopted 12 of assorted races, naming them the Rainbow Tribe, and driving her husband first to despair and then to Argentina. 
13/wsj_1327:Finally, Prince Rainier and Princess Grace saved her with the offer of a house in Monaco. 
13/wsj_1327:African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks.
13/wsj_1327:Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater, where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line (performing of course for all-white audiences). 
13/wsj_1327:Paris loved her at first sight. "She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her," sniffed the literary world's Maria Jolas, not entirely inaccurately. "One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end," Ms. Rose writes.
13/wsj_1327:Ms. Rose, who teaches literature at Wesleyan University, quickly proceeds to overemphasize, claiming that Baker's dancing "had uncovered a new region for desire" and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous. 
13/wsj_1327:"Jazz Cleopatra" contains other, more important, false notes that undermine what is, for the most part, a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works.
13/wsj_1327:It is easy to see why Baker, a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women, attracts Ms. Rose, the author of "Parallel Lives," a wonderful study of Victorian marriage. 
13/wsj_1327:Still, even the title raises questions about the author's vision of her subject.
13/wsj_1327:Baker's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term.
13/wsj_1327:Baker was 68 years old when she died in Paris, two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show: a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life.
13/wsj_1327:During World War II, her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted, a decision made by only about 2% of French citizens.
13/wsj_1327:She was devoted to Charles de Gaulle's cause, accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk to become first a spy and then a one-woman USO tour for the forces of Free France. 
13/wsj_1327:The night the Germans occupied all of France, Baker performed in Casablanca.
13/wsj_1327:One chapter opens: "World War II was not one of France's glorious moments." 
13/wsj_1327:In "Josephine Baker" (Jonathan Cape, 304 pages, $35), which was published in Britain last year and distributed in the U.S. this month, Mr. Hammond has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star.
13/wsj_1327:Mr. Lescaze is foreign editor of the Journal. 
13/wsj_1328:Manville, having rid itself of asbestos, now sells fiberglass, forest products, minerals and industrial goods.
13/wsj_1328:But Manville's ownership is unusual, and it has caught the eye of some canny -- and patient -- investors.
13/wsj_1328:The trust, which owns 80% of Manville's stock on a fully diluted basis, is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims. 
13/wsj_1328:When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its Manville stock to cash.
13/wsj_1328:But as an 80% owner, if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market, it would likely depress the price of its shares. 
13/wsj_1328:Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will, instead, seek to convert the company's shares to cash, in some sort of friendly restructuring that wouldn't involve just dumping stock on the market. 
13/wsj_1328:What makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares." 
13/wsj_1328:However, the trust's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims.
13/wsj_1328:Its cash and liquid securities fell by $338 million in the first six months of 1989. 
13/wsj_1328:And, beginning in 1992, it will have a claim on as much as 20% of Manville's annual net income.
13/wsj_1328:As of June 30, it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims, for an average of $40,424 each. (The average should drop over time, since the most expensive claims are being settled first).
13/wsj_1328:And as of midyear, settled but unpaid claims amounted to $136 million -- more than half the trust's total of $268 million in cash and marketable securities. "At some point, we're going to need an infusion of funds," a person close to the trust says. 
13/wsj_1328:Moreover, with 88% of its assets tied up in Manville, the trust is badly in need of diversification. "Obviously, a diversified portfolio would have less risk," the person close to the trust says. 
13/wsj_1328:Though the ink is barely dry on its new, post-bankruptcy law structure, Bill Bullock, Manville's head of investor relations, says the company is continually pondering "whether there is a better way to be structured.
13/wsj_1328:We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares," he says. 
13/wsj_1328:Of course, one option would be for Manville to buy out the trust's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders.
13/wsj_1328:Thus, analysts say, the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt Manville's other shareholders. "This is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders," one investor says. 
13/wsj_1328:Mr. Bullock says 45% of revenues are tied to construction.
13/wsj_1328:They are, nonetheless, high on Manville's management. "It's one of the best in the business," says Salomon Brothers analyst Stephen Dobi.
13/wsj_1328:With a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 1-to-1 -- and $329 million in cash -- Manville is indeed actively on the prowl. 
13/wsj_1328:Paul Kleinaitis, an analyst at Duff & Phelps, says, "Even though they have borrowing power, they have been disciplined about acquisitions." And Mr. Kleinaitis says that with 80% of its stock in friendly hands, Manville is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short-term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul. 
13/wsj_1329:Spokesmen for Emerson and Vermont American, which has agreed to be acquired, said they don't anticipate "any problems" with the completion of the transaction. 
13/wsj_1329:Emerson and Bosch, through their joint acquisition arm, Maple Acquisition, have begun a cash tender offer for all of Vermont's common shares outstanding.
13/wsj_1329:The offer, set to expire Nov. 1, may be extended pending the timing and resolution of the FTC request, the companies said. 
13/wsj_1329:The Vermont American acquisition is designed to enhance their position in the accessories portion of the power-tool industry. 
13/wsj_1330:The plan places an indicated value on the real estate operation, Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp., of $2 billion.
13/wsj_1330:If approved, the sale is expected to close by year's end, with the spinoff occurring by the end of 1992.
13/wsj_1330:As a result of the partial sale and spinoff, the $56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System would obtain two seats on the board of the real estate operation, according to officials of the fund, who described the plan. 
13/wsj_1330:Also holding two seats each on the board, they said, would be Olympia & York Developments Ltd., controlled by the Reichmann family of Canada, and Itel Corp., controlled by Chicago businessman Sam Zell.
13/wsj_1330:The Reichmanns and Mr. Zell, the largest holders of Santa Fe Pacific stock, have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments, including possible spinoffs. 
13/wsj_1330:The sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of Santa Fe Pacific into free-standing companies for its railroad and energy operations, as well as real estate.
13/wsj_1330:In addition, pension funds are rarely given seats on company boards and most often try to avoid them because of legal concerns. 
13/wsj_1330:Under the proposed plan, the fund would also lend Santa Fe Pacific Realty $75 million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the then-prevailing market price.
13/wsj_1330:The note would accrue interest at the rate of 13.5% a year, which would be payable to the fund after five years, according to Stephen E. Roulac, a real estate consultant working for the fund. 
13/wsj_1330:The purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun-off company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments, Mr. Roulac said.
13/wsj_1330:The spun-off concern "clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio," he said. 
13/wsj_1330:For the last year, Santa Fe Pacific has redirected its real estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties, hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio.
13/wsj_1330:That would help reduce Santa Fe Pacific's remaining debt to about $600 million from a high of $3.7 billion in early 1988. 
13/wsj_1330:It wasn't clear where Santa Fe Pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $500 million, which would be well above the $400 million that California pension fund officials say they plan to provide.
13/wsj_1330:Santa Fe Pacific Realty owns 2.8 million acres of property, including 219 buildings with more than 11 million square feet of space.
13/wsj_1330:It also holds nearly 40,000 acres of raw land with development potential, but under a previously announced strategy, the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in California, Arizona and the Chicago area.
13/wsj_1330:Fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with Santa Fe Pacific, but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago.
13/wsj_1331:After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have changed considerably.
13/wsj_1331:The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the government's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations. 
13/wsj_1331:In an eight-count indictment, the government charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., chemical maker, and Mr. Sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986. 
13/wsj_1331:The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian.
13/wsj_1331:After 93 hours of deliberation, the jurors in the second trial said they were hopelessly deadlocked, and another mistrial was declared on March 22. 
13/wsj_1331:The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF, Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo.
13/wsj_1331:For Mr. Sherwin, a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count.
13/wsj_1331:GAF faces potential fines of $500,000 for each count. 
13/wsj_1331:Individuals familiar with the case said that throughout September, defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial, but by the end of the month the talks had ended. 
13/wsj_1331:There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of GAF's attorney, Arthur Liman, and Mr. Sherwin's counsel, Stephen Kaufman, will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman.
13/wsj_1331:Attorneys for more than 18,000 women who claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for A.H. Robins Co., which manufactured the device. 
13/wsj_1331:The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other.
13/wsj_1331:Baltimore attorney Michael A. Pretl and 17 other attorneys representing 18,136 claimants in the U.S. and abroad argue that the appeal would delay -- and perhaps even destroy -- a $2.38 billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan. 
13/wsj_1331:The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims.
13/wsj_1331:It also bars future suits against Robins company officials, members of the Robins family and Robins's former insurer, Aetna Life & Casualty Co.
13/wsj_1331:The latter provision is "legally unprecedented," said Alan B. Morrison, a public interest lawyer in Washington, D.C., who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants. 
13/wsj_1331:Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts.
13/wsj_1331:Charles A. Donohoo, sole proprieter of a Louisville, Ky., demolition company, was found guilty of violating the Superfund law as well as the Clean Air Act. 
13/wsj_1331:Under Superfund, those who owned, generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup, regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time. 
13/wsj_1331:Environmental lawyers say virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities.
13/wsj_1331:But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment.
13/wsj_1331:Mr. Donohoo was convicted in Louisville late last month of violating Superfund by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building he was demolishing.
13/wsj_1331:He was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building, a violation of the Clean Air Act. 
13/wsj_1331:Mr. Donohoo faces as much as three years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the Superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $100,000 fine for the violation of the Clean Air Act. 
13/wsj_1331:Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, the Washington, D.C., law firm that spent over $1 million fighting the execution of mass-murderer Ted Bundy -- who eventually was executed -- has taken on another death penalty case before the Supreme Court, this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in Arkansas. 
13/wsj_1331:The law firm has filed a friend-of-the-court brief jointly with the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group.
13/wsj_1331:The key issue in the case, which the law firm is handling without a fee, or pro bono, is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review. 
13/wsj_1331:The murderer, Ronald Gene Simmons, was convicted of killing 14 people.
13/wsj_1331:Wilmer Cutler's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the inmate who filed the appeal lacks proper standing. 
13/wsj_1331:The coupling of the law firm and the Washington Legal Foundation is odd also, because Wilmer Cutler was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work. 
13/wsj_1331:"We give them a lot of credit for taking this case," says WLF's Alan Slobodin. 
13/wsj_1331:THE CASE OF THE FAKE DALIS: In federal court in Manhattan, three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake Salvador Dali lithographs.
13/wsj_1331:James Burke and Larry Evans, formerly owners of the now-defunct Barclay Gallery, and Prudence Clark, a Barclay sales representative, were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed, limited-edition lithographs.
13/wsj_1331:The posters were sold for $1,300 to $6,000, although the government says they had a value of only $53 to $200 apiece.
13/wsj_1332:Westamerica Bancorp. said Richard W. Decker resigned as president and chief executive officer after only a year on the job because of "differences" with the board. 
13/wsj_1332:It didn't specify the nature of the differences, saying only that they related to "management style" and "strategic objectives." 
13/wsj_1332:Westamerica said Mr. Decker's posts were assumed by David Payne, Westamerica's chairman, who at 34 years of age becomes one of the youngest chief executives of a sizable bank in the country.
13/wsj_1332:Westamerica has about $1.3 billion of assets and is the largest independent bank in northern California.
13/wsj_1332:It controls about 35% of the affluent Marin County market across the Golden Gate bridge from San Francisco. 
13/wsj_1332:The bank had been suffering in late 1987 from a slew of bad real estate loans made in Arizona.
13/wsj_1332:When he was hired, Mr. Payne lauded Mr. Decker's "extraordinary . . . skills" and his "outstanding reputation as one of the West's brightest bankers." 
13/wsj_1332:Though the bank isn't performing as well as some of its competitors in the lucrative California market, its condition has improved since Mr. Decker took over.
13/wsj_1332:For the six months ended June 30, it earned $3.1 million, or 61 cents a share, compared with net income of $2.4 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. 
13/wsj_1332:Interstate banking is scheduled to begin in California in 1991, and larger California banks, such as Wells Fargo & Co., have been paying fat premiums to buy smaller banks to control markets before any out-of-state banks enter the fray. 
13/wsj_1333:A profit last year in both the quarter and year included a net gain of $9.6 million, or 44 cents a share, from the sale of a division.
13/wsj_1333:Additionally, the full-year profit last year reflected an after-tax restructuring charge of $22.8 million, or $1.04 a share. 
13/wsj_1333:Shares of Varian, which last month warned there would be a fourth-quarter plunge, closed at $22.75, down 62.5 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
13/wsj_1334:In a last-ditch effort to keep its sales force and customer base, Integrated Resources Inc. said it agreed in principle to transfer ownership of its broker-dealer subsidiary to two of its top executives. 
13/wsj_1334:The financial-services firm, struggling since summer to avoid a bankruptcy-law filing after missing interest payments on about $1 billion of debt, will retain the right to regain the subsidiary.
13/wsj_1334:It said it will exercise that right only if it sells substantially all of its other core businesses.
13/wsj_1334:Because of Integrated's widely reported troubles, the unit's representatives had been requesting a name change.
13/wsj_1334:In the transaction, Integrated will transfer 100% ownership of the subsidiary to Gerard M. Lavin, executive vice president of Integrated and head of back-office operations at the subsidiary, and Gary W. Krat, executive vice president of the parent and president of the subsidiary. 
13/wsj_1334:In an interview, Mr. Krat said that based on criteria yet to be determined, he expects to distribute 49% of Royal Alliance to the representatives, who sell Integrated's insurance and mutual-fund products.
13/wsj_1334:Mr. Krat indicated that completion of the transaction could take several weeks, and it wasn't immediately clear what would happen to the broker-dealer subsidiary if Integrated files for bankruptcy-law protection in the meantime. 
13/wsj_1334:Many aspects of the agreement were worked out Wednesday in Chicago, when Integrated senior managers met with about 150 representatives. "I think it was something that we and they thought was constructive," said Stephen D. Weinroth, chairman and co-chief executive officer of Integrated. 
13/wsj_1335:The dollar weakened in indecisive trading as foreign-exchange dealers awaited fresh economic news that they hope will jolt the U.S. unit out of its narrow ranges. 
13/wsj_1335:The Canadian dollar climbed to its highest level against the U.S. dollar since late August, prompting the Bank of Canada to sell the Canadian currency on the market. 
13/wsj_1335:Traders say that after a week of nervously tracking every development on Wall Street, the foreign-exchange market has settled back to catch its breath ahead of new U.S. economic data.
13/wsj_1335:In Tokyo Tuesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.80 yen, down from Monday's Tokyo close of 142.40 yen. 
13/wsj_1335:The consensus view on real GNP, the total value of the U.S. output of goods and services adjusted for inflation, calls for a 2.3% gain on an annual basis, slowing somewhat from the second quarter's 2.5%, but still fairly strong. 
13/wsj_1335:Hubert Pedroli, managing director of foreign exchange at Credit Suisse in New York, adds, "The market sees this as the last piece of good news." 
13/wsj_1335:Mr. Pedroli notes that the GNP deflator, a measure of inflation, is expected to slow, which would give the Federal Reserve more room to ease key U.S. rates. 
13/wsj_1335:They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in August was reported earlier this month, hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed and sentiment gripped the market that the U.S. economy was losing its momentum.
13/wsj_1335:While the market expects little reaction from news of U.S. durable goods orders, scheduled for release today, participants note that the figures will probably serve to reinforce this bearish sentiment. 
13/wsj_1335:U.S. durable goods orders are expected to show a decline of 1.2% in September, according to economists.
13/wsj_1336:Liz Claiborne Inc., New York, said its third-quarter net income jumped 62%, citing continued strength in apparel sales and the start of shipments of its new product lines: a men's fragrance, large-size women's apparel and casual knitwear. 
13/wsj_1336:Claiborne's directors also declared its regular cash dividend payment of five cents a share payable on Dec. 5 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Nov. 13. 
13/wsj_1337:The index moved above 35670 at midmorning, nearly reaching the record of 35689.98 set Sept. 28.
13/wsj_1337:But the market lost part of the early gains on index-linked investment trust fund selling. 
13/wsj_1337:On Monday, traders noted that some investors took profits against the backdrop of the Nikkei's fast-paced recovery following its plunge last Monday in reaction to the Oct. 13 drop in New York stock prices. 
13/wsj_1337:The Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was up 7.81 at 2687.53. 
13/wsj_1337:But institutional investors may wait a little longer to appraise the direction of the U.S. monetary policy and the dollar, traders said. 
13/wsj_1337:Hiroyuki Wada, general manager of the stock department at Okasan Securities, said Monday's trading was "unfocused." 
13/wsj_1337:He said investors were picking individual stocks based on specific incentives and the likelihood of a wider price increase over the short term.
13/wsj_1337:Fujisawa continued to attract investors because of strong earning prospects stemming from a new immune control agent.
13/wsj_1337:London prices closed modestly higher in the year's thinnest turnover, a condition that underscored a lack of conviction ahead of a U.K. balance of payments report Tuesday. 
13/wsj_1337:Limited volume ahead of the September trade data showed the market is nervous, but dealers added that the day's modest gains also signaled some support for London equities. 
13/wsj_1337:"It's a case of the market being too high to buy and too afraid to sell," a senior dealer with Kleinwort Benson Securities said. "It's better to wait." 
13/wsj_1337:Volume was 276.8 million shares, beneath the year's previous low of 280.5 million shares Sept. 25, the session before the August trade figures were released. 
13/wsj_1337:Analysts' expectations suggest a September current account deficit of #1.6 billion ($2.54 billion), compared with August's #2.0 billion deficit.
13/wsj_1337:"The range of expectations is so broad," a dealer at another major U.K. brokerage firm said, "the deficit may have to be nearer or above #2 billion for it to have any impact on the market." 
13/wsj_1337:Share prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange closed narrowly mixed in quiet dealings after recovering most of their early losses.
13/wsj_1337:Brokers said the declines early in the day were partly caused by losses of the ruling Christian-Democratic Union in communal elections in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.
13/wsj_1337:The start of a weeklong conference by the IG Metall metal worker union in Berlin is drawing attention to the impending wage negotiations, which could boost companies' personnel costs next year, they said. 
13/wsj_1337:The market is still 4% short of its level before the plunge, and analysts aren't sure how long it will take until the DAX has closed that gap. 
13/wsj_1337:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
13/wsj_1338:Further, GSX will buy $1 million of Enviropact common stock, at $2.625 a share, plus an option to acquire an additional $1.5 million of common at the same price, the company said.
13/wsj_1338:Enviropact said the two divisions account for about $8 million of the company's $20 million in annual revenue.
13/wsj_1338:Enviropact said the proceeds will be used as working capital for expansion and to pay its existing tax liability of about $1.5 million that was due Sept. 15.

13/wsj_1347:Exxon Corp. filed suit against the state of Alaska, charging state officials interfered with the oil company's initial efforts to treat last spring's giant oil spill. 
13/wsj_1347:The state's suit alleges that Exxon's response to the spill failed to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound.
13/wsj_1347:Litigation, if not settled out of court, could drag on for years. 
13/wsj_1347:Exxon said in its suit that it will seek reimbursement from the state for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims it says resulted from the state's conduct.
13/wsj_1347:The oil company claims that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef. 
13/wsj_1347:Exxon claims that use of dispersants, which break an oil slick into microscopic droplets, was a crucial part of its immediate-response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather following the spill. 
13/wsj_1347:The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard.
13/wsj_1347:The state's opposition to the use of dispersants, Exxon says, caused the Coast Guard "to delay granting permission."

13/wsj_1349:The package was termed excessive by the Bush administration, but it also provoked a struggle with influential California lawmakers who sought unsuccessfully to add nearly $1 billion more and waive current restrictions to expedite the distribution of funds. 
13/wsj_1349:"I have no regrets about going forward," said Rep. Vic Fazio (D.,Calif.), who sought later to play down the sometimes hostile tone of the long evening meeting. "We are the Golden State," Mr. Fazio said, "and there is a certain amount of jealousy." 
13/wsj_1349:The funding is attached to a stopgap bill to keep most of the government operating through Nov. 15.
13/wsj_1349:"Everybody appreciates that it is a national disaster and that we've got to address it," said Mr. Darman, who came to the Capitol to meet with Mr. Whitten and California lawmakers before the committee session.

13/wsj_1349:A master of pork-barrel politics, he had crafted the $2.85 billion package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative.

13/wsj_1351:The company attributed the improvement to strong demand in the semiconductor equipment segment as well as the acquisition of Echelon Service Co. and the inclusion of a full year's results of operations for RTS Inc., compared with seven months' results for the prior year. 
13/wsj_1352:The program matches funds raised from the sale of the commercial paper with small to medium-sized leases.

13/wsj_1354:A year earlier, CMS posted profit of $1.1 million, or 13 cents a share, on sales of $48 million.
13/wsj_1354:Mr. Farooquee attributed the decline to an industrywide softening of demand for computer enhancement products.

13/wsj_1355:Property Capital, which is based in Boston, had told shareholders it expected to distribute at least $21 a share, or $229 million, in a liquidation, based on an expected asset sale price of $290 million or more.
13/wsj_1355:As a result of dropping the liquidation plan, shareholders will have to treat dividends received this year as ordinary income or capital gains rather than as tax free returns of capital, the company said. 
13/wsj_1356:A.H. Belo Corp. said its net income was $3.1 million, or 15 cents a share, in the third quarter, more than four times its profit of $663,000, or three cents a share, last year. 
13/wsj_1356:Belo said it increased its effective tax rate to 52% from 47% to account for potential liabilities related to an Internal Revenue Service investigation of its tax returns for the years 1984 through 1988.

13/wsj_1357:The California Student Aid Commission took the action Oct. 15 after a government audit cited National Technical Schools for having courses too short to be eligible for the educational loan program and having a student drop-out rate far in excess of federal standards, and it alleged other serious violations of law and regulations.

13/wsj_1359:The regulations, required under legislation enacted by Congress last year, will apply to imports of vehicles that weren't built to meet U.S. government auto safety standards and were intended for use in Europe or elsewhere abroad. 
13/wsj_1359:U.S. officials estimated that gray-market imports total about 2,100 units a year, a small part of the more than three million vehicles exported to the U.S. each year. 
13/wsj_1359:Congress tightened auto safety standards for gray-market imports after U.S. auto dealers, including franchised foreign-car dealers, complained that they often were blamed when the second and third buyers of such vehicles found that the cars couldn't meet U.S. auto safety standards. 
13/wsj_1360:In the year-ago quarter, the software developer reported pro forma earnings of $4.8 million, or 24 cents a share.

13/wsj_1360:For the fiscal year, the company said it anticipates reporting earnings of $23 million, or about $1.15 a share, including a charge of about $5.9 million, or 22 cents a share, related to the merger that created Legent out of Duquesne Systems Inc. and Morino Inc. in March 1989.
13/wsj_1360:Pro forma earnings for fiscal 1988 were $19.6 million, or 99 cents a share, on revenue of $97.2 million. 
13/wsj_1360:The company attributed much of the growth in earnings to increased demand for its systems productivity software. 
13/wsj_1361:Archive Corp. said it expects to report net income for its fiscal year ended Sept. 29 of a record $15 million, or $1.15 a share, up 43% from $10.5 million, or 80 cents a share, for the prior year. 
13/wsj_1361:The Costa Mesa, Calif., maker of computer tape drives also projected record revenue for the year of $181 million, up from $122.7 million for the previous year. 
13/wsj_1361:Archive attributed the gains to strong demand for its products, continued growth of the reseller market and the acquisition of Maynard Electronics in February, which accounted for about 14% of the company's revenue. 
13/wsj_1362:Detrex, which has annual sales of about $100 million, declined to say if it would post a loss in the third quarter.
13/wsj_1362:Detrex is setting aside $3.1 million for the cleanup, but said the reserve reduced its quarterly income by only $1.9 million because of tax considerations. 
13/wsj_1362:Detrex said it is one of at least 17 companies notified by the Environmental Protection Agency that they may be potentially responsible for cleaning up the Fields Brook watershed near Detrex's Ashtabula plant at a total cost the EPA estimates at $48 million -- a figure Detrex said the companies dispute. 
13/wsj_1363:First Executive Corp. said about 96% of the rights to purchase its depositary shares and warrants have been exercised. 
13/wsj_1363:Of the 17.6 million rights units issued, just under 17 million were exercised before the Oct. 10 expiration of the offering, the insurance holding company said.
13/wsj_1363:Remaining units will be sold to the underwriters, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder, Peabody & Co., which will also purchase an over-allotment of 2.3 million additional units. 
13/wsj_1363:In addition, analysts have viewed the rights offering as a takeover defense that prospectively balloons the number of shares outstanding. 
13/wsj_1363:Each of the units consists of two warrants, each of which could be used to purchase a half-share of common stock, and one depositary preference share.
13/wsj_1364:UNITED AIR'S PARENT quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of the labor-management buy-out, saying UAL should remain independent for now.

13/wsj_1364:His resignation follows a hostile takeover of the ad agency in May by WPP of Britain. 
13/wsj_1364:The Justice Department took steps that could restrict the use by prosecutors of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants. 
13/wsj_1364:Shearson was sued by money manager George Soros, who claimed one of his funds was defrauded out of $60 million during stock-index futures trading just after the 1987 crash. 
13/wsj_1364:Prime Computer plans to dismiss 20% of its work force to cut costs following its recent leveraged buy-out.
13/wsj_1364:The rapid advance of the 52-year-old executive surprised many at the company. 
13/wsj_1365:The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants. 
13/wsj_1365:The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors avoid disrupting "the normal business functions" of companies charged under the racketeering law, a senior department official said. 
13/wsj_1365:Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors "not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties" in a case brought under the racketeering law, the official, David Runkel, said. 
13/wsj_1365:The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines, Mr. Runkel said.
13/wsj_1365:Under that law, defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a "criminal enterprise" may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise. 
13/wsj_1365:They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged. 
13/wsj_1365:The department's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants "in proportion" to the nature of the alleged offense, Mr. Runkel said. "That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business, you don't attempt to seize the whole business; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime," he explained. 
13/wsj_1365:In general, the thrust of the department's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction, Mr. Runkel said. 
13/wsj_1366:It was the kind of snubbing rarely seen within the Congress, let alone within the same party. 
13/wsj_1366:Sen. Alan Cranston trekked over to the House side of Capitol Hill a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. Henry Gonzalez.
13/wsj_1366:It was offered as an expression of cooperation to Mr. Gonzalez, who is investigating the $2.5 billion failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association. 
13/wsj_1366:But instead of thanks, Sen. Cranston was treated with cool formality. "Every witness receives a formal subpoena," Rep. Gonzalez told him. 
13/wsj_1366:Seldom have House hearings caused so much apprehension in the Senate, where California Sen. Cranston and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of Lincoln by their friend and political benefactor, Charles Keating Jr., principal stockholder of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, Ariz. 
13/wsj_1366:At the first day of the House Banking Committee's hearings last week, William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency created to sell sick thrifts, said the agency is investigating whether Lincoln made illegal political contributions.
13/wsj_1366:Mr. Keating arranged nearly $1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes, and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers.
13/wsj_1366:Future witnesses include a former federal S&L regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to "subvert" the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of Mr. Keating. 
13/wsj_1366:Lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues, even those of opposing political parties.
13/wsj_1366:Early in his political career, as a city councilman in San Antonio, he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced, denouncing the closed-door affair publicly as a "bat-roost meeting." 
13/wsj_1366:The immediate target of Rep. Gonzalez's inquiry is Danny Wall, chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
13/wsj_1366:As the principal regulator of the thrift industry, Mr. Wall delayed seizing Lincoln S&L for more than two years after his staff told him that the California thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly. 
13/wsj_1366:Mr. Wall relieved them of responsibility for supervising Lincoln in 1988.
13/wsj_1366:Mr. Wall, however, is a self-proclaimed "child of the Senate" and former staff director of its Banking Committee.
13/wsj_1366:An inquiry into his handling of Lincoln S&L inevitably will drag in Sen. Cranston and the four others, Sens.
13/wsj_1366:They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of Lincoln S&L had dragged on for two years. "I'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names {of the senators} will be brought out," Mr. Gonzalez says. 
13/wsj_1366:This is raising eyebrows. "When I first got a glimpse at the witness list, I couldn't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this," says Michael Waldman, director of Congress Watch, a consumer group. "There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators." 
13/wsj_1366:And a Democratic aide to a Banking Committee member remarks, "I too am astounded by it, because Gonzalez has certainly placed a lot of Democratic senators in a very bad position." 
13/wsj_1366:Chairman Gonzalez expresses sympathy for Sen. Riegle, his counterpart as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. "He's wise, he's good and I know he's an honest man," the Texan says.
13/wsj_1366:Cranston and Riegle and Mr. Wall's principal sponsor, Republican Sen. Jake Garn of Utah. 
13/wsj_1366:At the time, Mr. Gonzalez said several senators told him that they "could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on Garn's insistence on Wall." Now Mr. Gonzalez is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway, under the guise of the Lincoln investigation. "In a way, that's what this is," Mr. Gonzalez concedes. 
13/wsj_1366:But he said he is prepared to testify that executives of Lincoln and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them to make specific contributions. 
13/wsj_1366:He has characterized the five senators' roles as "tantamount to an attempt to subvert the . . . regulatory process," and he isn't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a 1987 meeting. 
13/wsj_1367:Her husband and older son -- a computer prodigy profiled in The Wall Street Journal in 1981, when he was 13 -- run a software company with expected sales this year of $10 million.
13/wsj_1367:Most recently, she has become the publisher of Movieline, a four-year-old Los Angeles magazine that began national distribution last month, with an initial press run of 100,000 copies.
13/wsj_1367:Certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in Kiev, when she lived with her parents, her husband and her two sons in a 2 1/2-room apartment in what she calls "silent internal immigration," dreaming of escape. 
13/wsj_1367:With obvious satisfaction, she says she told him: "No darling, I just give it a Chanel look." She keeps track of the rest of her hats by stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of each hatbox. 
13/wsj_1367:Are the hats merely part of her new L.A. persona, along with the many ultra-thin Capri cigarettes she smokes, the parties she throws for 500 people, the Chekovian feasts she offers guests at her weekend place in Santa Barbara? 
13/wsj_1367:That done, Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with: an understanding of food, business, Russian culture, human nature, and parties. "Parties are rather a state of mind," she said, pausing only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik ("a little well done, but very good"). "If you are born to give parties, you give parties.
13/wsj_1367:As publisher of a magazine devoted to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies, Ms. Volokh sees her party-giving as an important part of business.
13/wsj_1367:She has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of people, but prefers more intimate gatherings. "At American cocktail parties everyone's always looking over your shoulder to see who they can talk to next.
13/wsj_1367:I like rather tea, because it is at the end of the day." She serves high Russian tea, at 5 p.m. "It's supposed to be later but I just moved it.
13/wsj_1367:She also frequently invites directors, producers, actors, writers and other show business people for "coffee and clips in the pleasure dome." Guests bring movies on tape, and show their favorite three-to-five minute segments on the screen that unrolls from the ceiling of the Volokhs' art-nouveau library ("the pleasure dome").
13/wsj_1367:The idea for Movieline actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the Volokhs, Boris Krutchensky (who has the title of co-publisher), and Laurie Halpern Smith, now the magazine's co-editor.
13/wsj_1367:She'll think of an idea the editorial people think is impossible, then she'll have us make it work." 
13/wsj_1367:Those columns -- vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of food as well as practical advice on how to glamorize dreary Sovietized meals -- became the basis for her erudite and entertaining cookbook, "The Art of Russian Cuisine," brought out in 1983 by Macmillan Publishing Co. 
13/wsj_1367:She was the child of relative privilege.
13/wsj_1367:Mr. Volokh was fired from his job, and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co-workers, accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities.
13/wsj_1367:The Volokhs were afraid that they'd end up like a friend of theirs who'd applied for a visa and waited for 10 years, having been demoted from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk. 
13/wsj_1367:Mr. Volokh soon found work in his field, but Ms. Volokh refused the obvious and available occupation-as translatorfor a Russian who spoke fluent English. "That's always looking back," she said. "I wanted to be in business." On the way to that goal, she received her first U.S. paycheck for proofreading a book of Polish poetry, attended secretarial school, then went to work for a fund-raising organization.

13/wsj_1368:Undeterred by such words of caution, corporate America is flocking to Moscow, lured by a huge untapped market and Mikhail Gorbachev's attempt to overhaul the Soviet economy.
13/wsj_1368:Doing business with the Russians, once the pursuit of a handful of hardened veterans, has become the goal of such major companies as General Motors Corp., Federal Express Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co., as well as a cluster of smaller firms.
13/wsj_1368:But while U.S. interest may be big and growing, the difficulties that have stymied deals in the past show no sign of abating.
13/wsj_1368:Alongside the old problems of a non-convertible currency and an inpenetrable bureaucracy, Western business executives must now grapple with new complexities linked to perestroika, the restructuring of the Soviet economy. 
13/wsj_1368:Changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of inexperienced Soviet players, many who promise more than they can deliver.
13/wsj_1368:And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles, their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation's republics. 
13/wsj_1368:"You have to go out to all your constituents," says James H. Giffen, who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market, involving investment of more than $5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures.
13/wsj_1368:As part of that attempt, by the American Trade Consortium, Mr. Giffen says he spends a lot of time lobbying. 
13/wsj_1368:Over the past two years, Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms, including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S., Montedison S.p.
13/wsj_1368:A. of Italy and several Japanese groups, about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants.
13/wsj_1368:For political as well as economic reasons, U.S. companies are at the top of his priorities -- a point he underscored by spending two hours walking around the U.S. trade show last week. 
13/wsj_1368:Talking to a small group of U.S. executives afterwards, Mr. Gorbachev appeared impatient for a big expansion in U.S.-Soviet trade, which now amounts to a meager $3 billion annually.
13/wsj_1368:The U.S. ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures, behind West Germany, Finland and Italy.
13/wsj_1368:According to several people present at the meeting, Mr. Gorbachev also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the U.S., possibly at his next summit meeting with President Bush. 
13/wsj_1368:Hundreds of people lined up every day at the Colgate-Palmolive Co. stand to receive a free tube of toothpaste, a commodity in chronically short supply here.
13/wsj_1368:The American Trade Consortium says it is planning to ship some $500 million of consumer goods, financed by bank credits, in the first few months of next year. 
13/wsj_1368:The goal of most U.S. firms -- joint ventures -- remains elusive.
13/wsj_1368:Because the Soviet ruble isn't convertible into dollars, marks and other Western currencies, companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find Soviet goods they can take in a counter-trade transaction. 
13/wsj_1368:Shelley M. Zeiger, an entrepreneur from New Jersey who buys Soviet porcelain and "matryoshka" nesting dolls for export to the U.S., says West German companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items. 
13/wsj_1368:Seeking to overcome the currency problems, Mr. Giffen's American Trade Consortium, which comprises Chevron Corp., RJR, Johnson & Johnson, Eastman Kodak Co., and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings, largely from the revenues of a planned Chevron oil project.
13/wsj_1368:"It's hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other countries," says Dennis A. Sokol, president of Medical Service Partners Inc., who is putting the medical consortium together. 
13/wsj_1368:One group seeks to publish a U.S.-Soviet medical journal in conjunction with the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Health.
13/wsj_1368:According to Richard P. Mills, a Boston-based official of the U.S. partner, 10,000 copies of the quarterly will be printed in Russian from next year.
13/wsj_1368:It will be financed by advertisements from U.S. companies and by simultaneous publication of an English-language journal containing details of Soviet medical advancements. 
13/wsj_1370:Cray Research Inc. said it sold one of its newest and largest computer systems, the Cray Y-MP/832, to the United Kingdom Meteorological Office.
13/wsj_1370:The supercomputer, which lists for $18.5 million, will be installed in the first quarter of 1990 in the meteorological office's headquarters in Bracknell, England. 
13/wsj_1371:Shareholders of Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano S.p.
13/wsj_1371:A. voted to accept a bid of 5,500 lire ($4.03) a share by France's Credit Agricole for 13.32% of the bank, rejecting an earlier, equal offer by Italy's Assicurazioni Generali S.p.
13/wsj_1371:It also opens a rift in the bank's shareholders' syndicate that could lead to a battle for control of the concern.
13/wsj_1371:Gemina, which owns 13.26% of Nuovo Banco, abstained in the final vote on Credit Agricole, which was nonetheless approved by a majority of shareholders. 
13/wsj_1371:The linkup with Credit Agricole will give Nuovo Banco its first foreign presence since it was formed from the wreck of the old Banco Ambrosiano, which collapsed amid scandal after the death of Chairman Roberto Calvi in 1982.
13/wsj_1371:Gemina said in a statement that "it reserves the right to take any action to protect its rights as a member of the syndicate." A company spokeswoman said the company hadn't decided what measures to take, but didn't rule out legal action. 
13/wsj_1371:A Generali spokesman declined to comment on Nuovo Banco's rejection of the insurer's offer. 
13/wsj_1372:Mr. Skase also said the restructuring plan calls for the merger of Qintex Australia with Qintex Ltd., which owns 55% of Qintex Australia.
13/wsj_1372:He said the move will "significantly reduce administrative and operating costs," but he didn't provide details of the merger. 
13/wsj_1372:Company officials said over the weekend that Qintex Australia's bank creditors have become concerned about a barrage of bad news at the company, including a failed US$1.5 billion plan to buy MGM/UA Communications Co., a Beverly Hills, Calif., movie and television production concern. 
13/wsj_1372:Friday, Qintex Entertainment Inc., a 43%-owned U.S. affiliate, filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
13/wsj_1372:The company's latest moves were disclosed after the Australian Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of Qintex Australia and Qintex Ltd. because the companies hadn't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans, investments and deposits at Qintex Entertainment. 
13/wsj_1372:Qintex Australia also said it has an investment of A$83.3 million in Qintex Entertainment shares. 
13/wsj_1372:In the statement, Mr. Skase said that on the basis of current interest rates in Australia, the company's asset sales would reduce interest expense by about A$120 million a year in addition to eliminating certain liabilities. 
13/wsj_1372:In March, Qintex sold 49% of the three Mirage resorts to Japan's Nippon Shinpan Co. and Mitsui & Co. for A$433 million.
13/wsj_1372:They were what he called an "unlawful termination" by MGM/UA of the acquisition agreement with Qintex, high Australian interest rates, a pilots' strike at Australian domestic airlines that cut revenue at the company's Australian resorts and delays in completing a sale of two regional TV stations in Queensland state.
13/wsj_1372:MGM/UA has sued Qintex Australia for breach of contract and fraud over the collapsed acquisition agreement, and Qintex Australia has threatened a countersuit. 
13/wsj_1372:Shareholders' funds as of July 31 were estimated at more than A$1 billion, Mr. Skase said, compared with A$725 million a year earlier. 
13/wsj_1372:The company will make "adequate provisions" to cover costs of the dispute with MGM/UA and any loss from the investment in Qintex Entertainment, he said. 
13/wsj_1372:Mr. Skase also disclosed a disagreement among directors of Qintex Australia over certain fees claimed by Qintex Group Management Services Pty., a management-services concern in which Qintex Australia executives have an interest. 
13/wsj_1372:Mr. Skase said most of the money went to other parties for expenses such as rent and travel, but a smaller portion is owed to senior executives and others for management services. 
13/wsj_1372:Non-executive directors of Qintex Australia, who must approve payments to the senior executives, balked at the amount.
13/wsj_1372:Two of the directors resigned, Mr. Skase said, so the payments haven't yet been approved. 
13/wsj_1373:Today's most widely used data-storing chips have "volatile" memories -- their data disappear if they aren't fed a steady diet of electricity, so they need external power supplies. 
13/wsj_1373:But Ramtron of Colorado Springs, Colo., plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple ferroelectric chips in December.
13/wsj_1373:The company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment, including floppy-disk and hard-disk drives. 
13/wsj_1373:National Semiconductor is getting ferroelectric technology from Krysalis Corp. in Albuquerque, N.M. National says it agreed to acquire Krysalis's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips, including a 4-kilobit memory, next year. 
13/wsj_1373:Once production hurdles are overcome, the chips could take over a significant part of the market.
13/wsj_1373:While lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before, the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper. 
13/wsj_1373:An attorney will be able to use the network for an hourly fee of between $200 and $400, depending on the quality of the picture, to take depositions from witnesses in any of the connected cities. 
13/wsj_1373:JAPAN'S MISUSE of U.S. patents has been a sore point for American chip makers.
13/wsj_1373:But last year Hitachi Ltd. surprised Japan's electronics industry when it accused Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. of using Hitachi technology to make dynamic random-access memory chips. (A settlement was reached but wasn't made public.) And Hitachi went on the offensive against the U.S.'s Motorola Inc. earlier this month with a suit charging that Motorola's new MC88200 chip infringes on a Hitachi patent. 
13/wsj_1373:Another recent Hitachi suit accuses Motorola of reverse engineering a Hitachi technology -- a turnabout from a nation of champion reverse engineers. 
13/wsj_1373:Hitachi charges Motorola "has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain Motorola patents" used in Motorola's MC68030 microprocessor chip. 
13/wsj_1373:Sharp says the set of chips could improve fax machines, graphics computers or identification systems that recognize facial features. . . . An N.V. Philips unit has created a computer system that processes video images 3,000 times faster than conventional systems.
13/wsj_1373:Using reduced instruction-set computing, or RISC, chips made by Intergraph of Huntsville, Ala., the system splits the image it "sees" into 20 digital representations, each processed by one chip. 
13/wsj_1374:Tandy Corp., citing sluggish sales of consumer-electronics goods, said net income dropped 3.3% for the first quarter ended Sept. 30. 
13/wsj_1374:The results, which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer, disappointed analysts and traders.
13/wsj_1374:Tandy said consumer electronics sales at its Radio Shack stores have been slow, partly because of a lack of hot, new products. 
13/wsj_1374:He said Tandy "has done a decent job" increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its Grid Systems Corp. subsidiary, which sells computers to bigger businesses, but "it's not enough to offset the problems at Radio Shack." Sales at Radio Shack stores open more than a year grew only 2% in the quarter from a year earlier, he said. 
13/wsj_1374:Barry Bryant, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said Tandy also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small-office market, which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market. 
13/wsj_1375:At a private dinner Thursday, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. chief executive Frederick Joseph delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to officials of Prudential Insurance Co. of America. 
13/wsj_1375:He said Drexel -- the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds -- could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because Drexel risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise. 
13/wsj_1375:Amid the market disorder, even Drexel, which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors, is pulling in its horns.
13/wsj_1375:Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market, Drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults, withdrawn new offerings, redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors. 
13/wsj_1375:In the third quarter, for example, junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns, the only major sector of the bond market to do so.
13/wsj_1375:Since the end of last year, junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds, including ultra-safe Treasury securities. 
13/wsj_1375:The junk market, which mushroomed to $200 billion from less than $2 billion at the start of the decade, has been declining for months as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments.
13/wsj_1375:In an interview, Mr. Joseph says his dinner discussion with the Prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk. "What I thought I was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and, appropriately enough, quite quality-conscious, which is not at all bad," he says. "Nobody's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years, and we're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market." 
13/wsj_1375:What has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk bonds cannot necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds.
13/wsj_1375:At closely held Deltec Securities Corp., junk bond money managers Amy K. Minella and Hannah H. Strasser say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise.
13/wsj_1375:In recent months, they say, there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market's traditional investors, while new buyers haven't materialized to replace them. 
13/wsj_1375:Wall Street securities firms, "the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market," have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses, Deltec said in a recent, grim report to customers.
13/wsj_1375:Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced "above-normal" redemptions by shareholders, Deltec said. 
13/wsj_1375:And, Deltec said, buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation. "In fact, savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter," Deltec said. 
13/wsj_1375:Meanwhile, Prudential, the nation's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds, has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $6.5 billion from $7 billion since August because of falling junk prices. "We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here, and it's something to be concerned about," says James A. Gregoire, a managing director. "I have no reason to think things will get worse, but this market has a knack for surprising us.
13/wsj_1375:Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default, the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble, says Stuart Reese, manager of Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's $17 billion investment-grade public bond portfolio. "But we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse.
13/wsj_1375:The big insurer, unlike Prudential, owns only about $150 million of publicly sold junk bonds. 
13/wsj_1375:The string of big junk bond defaults, which have been a major cause of the market's problems this year, probably will persist, some analysts say. "If anything, we're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined," says Paul Asquith, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. 
13/wsj_1375:His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34%. 
13/wsj_1375:One indication of a growing number of junk defaults, Mr. Asquith says, is that about half of the $3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by S&P this year are junk bonds sold during the market's big issue years of 1984 through 1986. 
13/wsj_1375:"Obviously, we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market wasn't so risky," says Bradford Cornell, professor of finance at University of California's Anderson Graduate School of Management in Los Angeles.
13/wsj_1375:Mr. Cornell has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds.
13/wsj_1375:During the past three weeks, for example, Drexel has sold $1.3 billion of new junk bonds for Turner Broadcasting Co., Uniroyal Chemical, Continental Air and Duff & Phelps. 
13/wsj_1375:Still, the list of troubled Drexel bond offerings dwarfs that of any firm on Wall Street, as does its successful offerings.
13/wsj_1375:"Quality junk bonds will continue to trade well," says Michael Holland, chairman of Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc. "But the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste." 
13/wsj_1376:As Helen Boehm, who owns an art porcelain company, sipped her luncheon cocktail, she reeled off the names of a few pals -- Prince Charles, Princess Diana, Sarah Ferguson, John Kluge, Milton Petrie. 
13/wsj_1376:Then, flashing a diamond ring as big as the Ritz ("my day diamond, darling"), she told her two companions that she is on the "board" of the Vatican Museum in Rome. 
13/wsj_1376:As it turns out, the board has a lot of important members, including Winton Blount (former postmaster general of the U.S.), Mrs. Henry Gaisman (widow of the inventor of auto-strop razor) and Vincent Murphy (an investment banker at Merrill Lynch & Co.) But Mrs. Boehm didn't mention any of them. 
13/wsj_1376:"Helen Boehm has a way with names," says James Revson, a gossip columnist for Newsday (and son of Joseph Revson, a founder of Revlon).
13/wsj_1376:But the truth is that almost everyone, from real-estate agents to city fathers, name-drops; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who did the Katzenjammer Kids. (In case you have forgotten, his name was Rudolph Dirks.) 
13/wsj_1376:"Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating," says Herbert Freudenberger, a New York psychoanalyst, with a high-powered clientele. "It can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society. . . . It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone you don't know." 
13/wsj_1376:Like the Long Island matron in the theater district the other day who swore to a stranger that she once met Liza Minnelli. "I was having a drink in Sardi's, when all of a sudden I saw a woman's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks.
13/wsj_1376:Name-dropping recently helped Mr. Houston-Montgomery crash a party Fame magazine threw for 100 of the 2,809 people mentioned in the diaries of the late Andy Warhol. "I guess I might have asked Beauregard to leave, but he drops so many good names, we decided to let him stay," says Steven Greenberg, publisher of Fame. "After all, Warhol was the ultimate namedropper, dropping five a day in his diaries.
13/wsj_1376:Mr. Houston-Montgomery says that at the party he waved to Malcolm Forbes, publisher of Forbes magazine ("We've been in the columns together"), Mary Boone, a New York art dealer ("I think she knows me, but I'm not sure ") and Bridget Fonda, the actress ("She knows me, but we're not really the best of friends"). 
13/wsj_1376:These droppers don't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps, Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher. "They even drop semi-obscure names like Wolfgang Flottl, whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows," says Mr. Revson. "It's the one-upsmanship of name-dropping that counts." 
13/wsj_1376:In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image, some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer. 
13/wsj_1376:It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire, because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant.
13/wsj_1376:"It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top," says George Miller, executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign, a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city's strengths. 
13/wsj_1376:Mr. Miller notes that actor Paul Newman's family owned a sporting-goods store in Cleveland, that the late actress Margaret Hamilton, who played the bad witch in "The Wizard Of Oz," once ran a nursery school in Cleveland and that comedian Bob Hope's father, a stonemason, once worked on a church next to Severence Hall, Cleveland's main concert hall. "Power names like that don't hurt the city's reputation," Mr. Miller says. 
13/wsj_1376:Len Kessler, a financial publicist in New York, sometimes uses it to get the attention of journalists who try to avoid him.
13/wsj_1376:He admits he has no story on any of them on these occasions. "But it does get him to return my calls, and it makes me feel better for the times he's given me the brushoff," Mr. Kessler says. 
13/wsj_1376:There are, of course, obvious dangers to blatant, unsubstantiated name-dropping.
13/wsj_1376:In New York society, Pat Buckley, the very social wife of author William Buckley, has the nicknames "Mrs.
13/wsj_1376:Buckles" and "Patsy." And her husband sometimes calls her "Ducky." "But call her `Patty, ' and it's a sure giveaway you're not in her circle, because she doesn't use that name," says Joan Kron, editor-in-chief of Avenue magazine, a monthly publication sent to all the right names. 
13/wsj_1376:John Spencer Churchill, a nephew of the late Sir Winston Churchill, former prime minister of Great Britain, isn't that impressed with most name-droppers he meets.
13/wsj_1377:Part of a Series} 
13/wsj_1377:Twenty years ago, in the infancy of suburban sprawl, just a handful of dealerships were here.
13/wsj_1377:Under construction is the strip's 24th showroom, the future home of Lexus, a luxury marque launched by Toyota Motor Corp. just two months ago. 
13/wsj_1377:The 1980s have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in America, in everything from phone companies to colas.
13/wsj_1377:Americans now can choose among 572 different models of cars, vans and trucks, up from just 408 when the decade began, according to Automotive News, a trade publication. 
13/wsj_1377:For car marketers, it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal customers from defecting to one of the new makes on the block.
13/wsj_1377:For American car buyers, the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing. 
13/wsj_1377:Malcolm MacDougall, vice chairman of the Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor advertising agency in New York, calls the proliferation "nameplate mania." He says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today, and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a well-defined image. "The winners," he predicts, "will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value." 
13/wsj_1377:Some auto executives believe the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks. "There's more noise out there, and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it," says Vincent P. Barabba, executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp. "But the reward is that there's less need to make tradeoffs" in choosing one's wheels. 
13/wsj_1377:Jeanene Page, of North Salt Lake City, Utah, likes the broader selection.
13/wsj_1377:The number of makes has mushroomed because the U.S. is the world's biggest and richest market for automobiles; virtually every auto maker wants to sell here.
13/wsj_1377:Detroit tries to counter the foreign invasion with new brands of its own.
13/wsj_1377:The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of Buying" survey found that 53% of today's car buyers tend to switch brands.
13/wsj_1377:Three of every 10 buyers under 30 would prefer to buy a sports car, compared with just 16% of adults 30 and over, according to the Journal survey. 
13/wsj_1377:Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a 37% to 28% margin -- even though older buyers, because of their incomes, are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car. 
13/wsj_1377:Perhaps most striking, 35% of households headed by people aged 18 to 44 have at least one foreign car.
13/wsj_1377:That's true of only 14% of households headed by someone 60 or older.
13/wsj_1377:Generally, imports appeal most to Americans who live in the West and are well-educated, affluent and, especially, young. "For many baby boomers, buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience," says Christopher Cedergren, auto-market analyst with J.D. Power & Co. of Agoura Hills, Calif. 
13/wsj_1377:Only 58% of Americans now believe that foreign cars get better gas mileage than domestic models, the Journal survey found, down from 68% in 1987.
13/wsj_1377:But out on Cobb Parkway, Ted Negas sees it differently. "The competition is so intense that an owner's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent," says Mr. Negas, vice president of Ed Voyles Oldsmobile, one of the first dealerships to locate on the strip.
13/wsj_1377:Thus the very fickleness of baby boomers may make it possible to win them back, just as it was possible to lose them. 
13/wsj_1377:Some 60% of the survey respondents said they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag.
13/wsj_1377:But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days.
13/wsj_1377:Americans spent more than $190 billion on new cars and trucks last year, and just 1% of that market exceeded Polaroid Co. 's sales of $1.86 billion. "Even if it's only 1%," says GM's Mr. Barabba, "would you throw away sales the size of Polaroid?" 
13/wsj_1379:It's a California crime saga worthy of an Erle Stanley Gardner title: The Case of the Purloined Palm Trees. 
13/wsj_1379:Cycads, the most popular of which is the Sago Palm, are doll-sized versions of California's famous long-necked palms, with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds.
13/wsj_1379:Because the Sago is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year, it's a pricey lawn decoration: A two-foot tall Sago can retail for $1,000, and taller ones often fetch $3,000 or more. 
13/wsj_1379:Police suspect that the criminals, who dig up the plants in the dead of night, are selling them to nurseries or landscapers.
13/wsj_1380:Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume. 
13/wsj_1380:September program trading amounted to 13.8% of average daily New York Stock Exchange volume of 151.8 million shares, the largest percentage since the exchange began making such figures public in July 1988. 
13/wsj_1380:A daily average of 20.9 million shares traded in program strategies in September, the second-highest level ever.
13/wsj_1380:The highest level was in June 1989, when a daily average of 22.1 million shares traded in program strategies.
13/wsj_1380:Average daily trading volume in June of 180.3 million shares was considerably higher than in September.
13/wsj_1380:Program trading amounted to 12.3% of average daily volume in June. 
13/wsj_1380:The Big Board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks.
13/wsj_1380:The most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage, in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits.
13/wsj_1380:It's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market. 
13/wsj_1380:Salomon Brothers Inc. was the top program trader in September, but most of the firm's activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock-index arbitrage.
13/wsj_1380:Overall, Salomon reported program trading volume of 75.2 million shares. 
13/wsj_1380:Of Morgan Stanley's 66.8 million shares in program trades for the month, 53.1 million were in stock-index arbitrage trades. 
13/wsj_1381:A group of shareholders filed suit against Imperial Corp. of America, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., First Executive Corp. and others, charging them with artificially inflating Imperial's stock price to protect certain major investors. 
13/wsj_1381:The complaint, filed in federal district court, accuses Imperial and other defendants of issuing false and misleading financial data.
13/wsj_1381:It also charges that Imperial, the holding company for Imperial Savings & Loan, experienced major losses and writedowns because of improper assessment of the risks of junk-bond investments and wholesale consumer loan packages.
13/wsj_1381:Imperial is in the midst of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities. 
13/wsj_1381:Imperial said in a statement it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in Barron's magazine that focused on the company's problems. 
13/wsj_1381:In a separate complaint also filed in federal court here, shareholder Max Grill of New York charged Imperial, its top executives and directors with breach of fiduciary duty and squandering the company's assets.
13/wsj_1382:Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
13/wsj_1383:Rhone-Poulenc S.A., Paris, said it completed the purchase of the specialty chemicals operation of RTZ Corp., a British mining and industrial group. 
13/wsj_1383:Rhone-Poulenc, a chemical and pharmaceutical company, said RTZ Chemicals has annual sales of about $900 million.
13/wsj_1383:It didn't release terms of the transaction. 
13/wsj_1385:A group including Gene E. Phillips, former chairman of Southmark Corp., and William S. Friedman, former vice chairman of Southmark, lowered its stake in the Dallas real estate concern to 7.7%, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
13/wsj_1386:While the prototype converter is costly, it's being lauded by the infant HDTV industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium. 
13/wsj_1386:"The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along," says David Niles, president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc., a New York pioneer in high-definition programming.
13/wsj_1386:He notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their TV sets with HDTVs. 
13/wsj_1386:And only a handful of small U.S. companies are engaged in high-definition software development.
13/wsj_1386:It's estimated that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for airing. 
13/wsj_1386:It would be like "watching a black and white movie on a color TV set," says Malcolm G. Saull, chairman of the film and video department at the Rochester Institute of Technology. 
13/wsj_1386:The new converters are "a critical link between film and the television domain," says Joerg D. Agin, vice president and general manager of Kodak's Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products division. 
13/wsj_1386:A similar machine already on the market, made by Rank Sintel Ltd., a unit of Rank Organisation, costs about $500,000. 
13/wsj_1386:They can't afford to stay out of HDTV." 
13/wsj_1386:And the sets are wider, resembling the dimensions of a movie screen. 
13/wsj_1386:Experts estimate the first sets of HDTVs won't be available for another five to 10 years, and will probably retail for more than $3,000 each in today's dollars.
13/wsj_1386:Some critics say they won't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price. 
13/wsj_1387:And as it unfolds, it's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society. 
13/wsj_1387:Already, ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month.
13/wsj_1387:But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling-party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone. 
13/wsj_1387:"The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast," says Shigezo Hayasaka, former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst.
13/wsj_1387:But, he adds, "We can't tell where it will go at all because we're still in the middle of it." 
13/wsj_1387:Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling.
13/wsj_1387:Pachinko is slightly on the shady side, often linked to the lower ranks of Japan's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders.
13/wsj_1387:Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions, and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe.
13/wsj_1387:Also, about 60% of pachinko parlor owners are Korean, many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents' organizations, and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan. 
13/wsj_1387:Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country.
13/wsj_1387:At 500 yen ($3.60) for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime, and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II. 
13/wsj_1387:But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen (almost $92 billion), or nearly the size of Japan's vaunted automobile industry.
13/wsj_1387:And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion, some observers estimate the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen. 
13/wsj_1387:Then, in 1988, a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament.
13/wsj_1387:The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin: North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral. 
13/wsj_1387:But the press kept it alive; as with the Recruit scandal, lists began circulating with names of people who had received money. 
13/wsj_1387:Within a matter of weeks, less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations.
13/wsj_1387:Direct donations from either of the residents' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign, but both groups deny making direct donations.
13/wsj_1387:They say its possible some of their members may be donating privately. 
13/wsj_1387:That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when Japan occupied Korea before World War II -- and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in Japanese society. 
13/wsj_1387:But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP's alleged donations, implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally. 
13/wsj_1388:Unfortunately, his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman the same night, and she was adamant about his attending. "I threw such a fit," says Mr. McDuffie, who had begun violin studies at the age of six. "But once Perlman started playing, I didn't give a damn about basketball. . . . Afterwards, I went home and practiced for three hours." 
13/wsj_1388:He's currently in the midst of a 17-city U.S. tour with Yehudi Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia, with stops including Charleston, S.C. (Oct. 25), Sarasota, Fla. (Oct. 28), Tampa, Fla. (Oct. 29) and Miami (Oct. 31).
13/wsj_1388:Yet Mr. McDuffie's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries.
13/wsj_1388:During the late 1970s, he was part of a musical "brat pack" -- a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay.
13/wsj_1388:His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz, a protege of Isaac Stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student; Cho-Liang Lin, who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition. 
13/wsj_1388:She thought I wasn't getting my practicing done." As the violinist tells it, his grandmotherly looking teacher "put her hands on her hips, stomped her foot and said, `You've just got to get the {expletive deleted} out of there. '" 
13/wsj_1388:Miss DeLay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital. "We listened to the Chausson `Poeme, '" he recalls, "and she said, `You hear the first note, that B-flat?
13/wsj_1388:After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter's "Violin Concerto," Mr. McDuffie was invited to play the work for the composer, who was dying of cancer. 
13/wsj_1388:It's written `marcato' in the score, and I played it that way, kind of gigue-like.
13/wsj_1388:"So we did it over," he adds. "I played very transparently, with the tip of the bow.
13/wsj_1388:By contrast, he's won kudos for his espousal of William Schuman's "Violin Concerto," which he recently recorded for Angel/EMI along with Leonard Bernstein's engaging "Serenade for Violin Solo, Strings and Percussion." 
13/wsj_1388:Mr. McDuffie's sweet tone, heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works.
13/wsj_1388:Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin's direction, this "Serenade" really swings.
13/wsj_1389:A lot of observers think so, and, if they're right, the whole economy as well as the spendthrifts among us could be hurt.
13/wsj_1389:A sudden, forced cutback by consumers, who normally account for about two-thirds of economic activity, would damp the economy at a time when plant-and-equipment spending is slowing and deficit-racked governments can't readily take up the slack.
13/wsj_1389:And another wave of bad loans would further batter many already-shaky lending institutions. 
13/wsj_1389:And the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income -- personal income after taxes -- has hit a high of about 18 1/2%. 
13/wsj_1389:In a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economists in San Francisco, Mr. Durkin comments that "installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances, and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences." He adds: "We are now witnessing a slowdown which, if history is a guide, could persist for a while." 
13/wsj_1389:Mr. Durkin doubts that "there is some magic level" at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income "indicates economic problems." And, "more importantly," he says, "the debt burden measured other ways is not really in uncharted waters." 
13/wsj_1389:The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income, though up a bit, hasn't climbed steeply, and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed.
13/wsj_1389:Moreover, the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be "lower in this cycle than earlier," Mr. Durkin says.
13/wsj_1389:He notes that some "revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit" being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing.
13/wsj_1389:In addition, he says, "longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden." 
13/wsj_1389:And if you "consider the changing distribution of credit," Mr. Durkin says, "much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by higher-income families," that is, "those probably best able to handle it." 
13/wsj_1389:Citing figures on home-equity loans, he notes that "11% of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts, but the proportion rises to 16% of homeowners in the $45,000-$60,000 income range and 23% of homeowners with income above $60,000." And much home-equity credit is used conservatively. "The most frequent use is home improvement, which presumably improves the value of the property," Mr. Durkin says. 
13/wsj_1389:A severe recession could, of course, raise delinquency rates, but so far the current levels of consumer debt don't seem to loom as a major threat.
13/wsj_1389:"Consumers appear unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending," Bruce Steinberg, a Merrill Lynch economist, says. "As a result, household debt appears to be stabilizing at around 63% of GNP." 
13/wsj_1390:Maidenform Inc. loves to be intimate with its customers, but not with the rest of the public. 
13/wsj_1390:The 67-year-old maker of brassieres, panties, and lingerie enjoys one of the best-known brand images, but its financial profile is closely guarded by members of the founding family. "There are very few companies that can boast of such a close-knit group," says Robert A. Brawer, 52 years old, recently named president, succeeding Beatrice Coleman, his mother-in-law, who remains chairman. "We are a vanishing breed," he muses. 
13/wsj_1390:Its current ad campaign, on which Maidenform has spent more than $15 million since fall 1987, doesn't even show its underwear products, but rather men like Christopher Reeve, star of the "Superman" movies, talking about their lingerie turn-ons. 
13/wsj_1390:The Maidenform name "is part of American pop culture," says Joan Sinopoli, account supervisor of the campaign by Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver, a New York ad firm.
13/wsj_1390:"Capitalizing on the brand is key," says Mr. Brawer, whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the U.S. 
13/wsj_1390:Although working women are "forced to wear the uniform of the day, to retain their femininity they are buying better quality, more upscale intimate apparel," he said. 
13/wsj_1390:Although Mr. Brawer's appointment as president was long expected, the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of Alan Lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising.
13/wsj_1390:Three days later, Mr. Lesk was named president and chief executive officer of Olga Co., a competing intimate apparel division of Warnaco Inc. Warnaco also owns Warners, another major intimate apparel maker. 
13/wsj_1390:But Maidenform officials say that after spending 24 years at Maidenform, Mr. Lesk, 48, made it clear he wanted the top job. "If you want the presidency of the company, this isn't the firm to work for," says James Mogan, 45, who was named senior vice president of sales, assuming some of the responsibilities of Mr. Lesk. 
13/wsj_1390:The company downplayed the loss of Mr. Lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people. "My style is less informal," Mr. Brawer says. 
13/wsj_1390:The company could command a good price in the market. "Over the past three and a half years, apparel companies, many of whom have strong brand names, have been bought at about 60% of sales," says Deborah Bronston, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. apparel analyst. 
13/wsj_1390:Mr. Brawer, along with Mrs. Coleman and her daughter, Elizabeth, an attorney who is vice chairman, are the family members involved in the operations of Maidenform, which employs about 5,000.
13/wsj_1390:The company has 14 plants and distribution facilities in the U.S., Puerto Rico, other parts of the Caribbean and Ireland. 
13/wsj_1390:Maidenform products are mainly sold at department stores, but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in Omaha, Neb., and has 24 factory outlets, with plans to add more. 
13/wsj_1390:Before joining Maidenform in 1972, Mr. Brawer, who holds a doctoral degree in English from the University of Chicago, taught at the University of Wisconsin.
13/wsj_1390:To maintain exclusivity of that designer line, it isn't labeled with the Maidenform name. 
13/wsj_1391:China could exhaust its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year, a Western government report says, unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the balance-of-payments deficit. 
13/wsj_1391:According to the report, completed last month, if China's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year, the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991.
13/wsj_1391:A country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports.
13/wsj_1391:The $14 billion of reserves China had in June would cover just that much. 
13/wsj_1391:According to Chinese customs figures, import growth has slowed in recent months, dropping to 16% in July and 7.1% in August from the year-earlier periods, compared with an average growth rate of 26% in the first half. 
13/wsj_1391:The $14 billion level in June marked a drop from $19 billion at the end of April.
13/wsj_1391:But this time, China faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the Tiananmen Square killings June 4. 
13/wsj_1391:Because of this and the huge trade gap, the deficit in China's current account, which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds, is expected to widen sharply from the $3.8 billion deficit last year. 
13/wsj_1391:The Western government report suggests a number of scenarios for China's current-account balance, two of which are considered most likely. 
13/wsj_1391:In one, imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of 25% and 5% recorded during the first seven months, and the current-account deficit widens to $13.1 billion.
13/wsj_1391:In 1985, China had a record deficit of $11.4 billion. 
13/wsj_1391:In this case, China would still finish the year with a current-account deficit of $8.7 billion, based on projections that imports for all of this year grow 20% and exports 10%. 
13/wsj_1391:In addition, economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of China's deteriorating political and economic environment.
13/wsj_1391:On top of all this, foreign-debt repayments are expected to peak in 1991 to 1992. 
13/wsj_1391:With less capital coming in, China's balance of payments would suffer.
13/wsj_1391:But in either case, the report says, China's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves, which are used to finance the imbalance.
13/wsj_1392:Roche Holding AG, parent of the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, said its group sales rose 22% in the first nine months of the year to 7.32 billion francs ($4.51 billion). 
13/wsj_1392:The company reported good gains in all of its divisions. 
13/wsj_1393:New Canaan Investments Inc. said it closed the acquisition of Carr-Lowrey Glass Co. from Newell Co., a Freeport, Ill., maker of do-it-yourself home products. 
13/wsj_1393:Carr-Lowrey, a maker of glass bottles for the cosmetics and toiletries industries, had sales last year of about $40 million. 
13/wsj_1394:Federal's employees work long hours and seem to thrive on the stress of racing the clock.
13/wsj_1394:Under federal transportation law, a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of Tiger's job classifications into Federal's.
13/wsj_1394:These groups constitute up to 10% of its work force. 
13/wsj_1394:"Unions would have a profound effect on the whole culture of the company," says Bernard La Londe, a professor at Ohio State University at Columbus and a Federal consultant. 
13/wsj_1394:Since founding the company, the charismatic Vietnam vet, who is still only 46 years old, has fostered an ethos of combat.
13/wsj_1394:Flights are "missions." Mr. Smith's managers have, at times, been called "Ho Chi Minh's Guerrillas." The Bravo Zulu award, the Navy accolade for a "job well done," is bestowed on Federal's workers who surpass the call of duty.
13/wsj_1394:And, with many of his 70,000 workers, Mr. Smith's damn-the-torpedoes attitude has caught on.
13/wsj_1394:But though couriers work as many as 60 hours a week during the autumn rush, they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum paycheck.
13/wsj_1394:The operational freedom has also given Federal a leg up on archrival United Parcel Service Inc., the nation's largest employer of United Brotherhood of Teamsters members.
13/wsj_1394:These and other problems squeezed Federal's profit margins last year to 8%, down from more than 13% annually in the first half of the decade.
13/wsj_1394:Earnings have plummeted, too, in each of the past three quarters.
13/wsj_1394:In the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31, profit fell 54% to $30.4 million, or 58 cents a share, mostly because of the Tiger merger, Federal says. 
13/wsj_1394:Federal's stock price, however, has held up well, driven in part by the general run-up of airline stocks, analysts say.
13/wsj_1394:There's a certain irony in the fact that Federal Express faces its first union problems as a result of its Tiger purchase.
13/wsj_1394:Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies "over the Hump" from India to China during World War II.
13/wsj_1394:In the early 1970s, Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations.
13/wsj_1394:Until then, they expect the cost of integrating the two carriers to continue crimping profits. 
13/wsj_1394:For now, the union issue is the most nettlesome of Federal's Tiger problems, management believes.
13/wsj_1394:When a large group of pilots once signed petitions opposing work-rule and compensation changes, he called a meeting in a company hangar and dressed them down for challenging his authority.
13/wsj_1394:He then made most of the changes, pilots say. 
13/wsj_1394:That sort of approach, however, hasn't worked since the addition of Tiger.
13/wsj_1394:Its 6,500 workers, who had battled Tiger's management for years over givebacks, were union members until the day of the merger, when most of their unions were automatically decertified.
13/wsj_1394:In his haste to seal the deal with Tiger Chairman Saul Steinberg last August, Mr. Smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago: that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be "end-tailed" -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules, pay and career options.
13/wsj_1394:The Tiger merger agreement stipulated that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure. 
13/wsj_1394:And even some pro-union pilots say his charisma and popularity among the many former military fliers could be tough to beat. "A lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against Fred Smith," says J.X. Gollich, a Tiger-turned-Federal pilot and union activist. 
13/wsj_1394:The issue has also cost Federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots. "They were willing to mistreat us because we hadn't shown any moxie, any resistance," says William Queenan, a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran.
13/wsj_1394:Adds John Poag, a 727 captain and past chairman of the company-sponsored Flight Advisory Board: "They've made all these magnanimous gestures to the Flying Tiger pilots, and for us, nothing." 
13/wsj_1394:A large majority of the 961 former Tiger fliers support the union, according to a union study.
13/wsj_1394:But though most of the 1,087 Federal pilots are believed opposed, it is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. Smith has been eroded. 
13/wsj_1394:Barney Barnhardt, a 727 captain and leader of the pro-union forces, said he has received two anonymous death threats and been challenged to a fight with tire irons by a colleague. "The pilots are either for us or extremely against us," he says with a sigh. 
13/wsj_1395:The company said it received an order for 23 of the vehicles, which retrieve tanks and other heavy-tracked vehicles when they break down or are damaged, and an option for 16 more. 
13/wsj_1396:The Senate convicted U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida of eight impeachment articles, removing the 53-year-old judge from his $89,500-a-year, lifetime job. 
13/wsj_1396:Mr. Hastings's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him.
13/wsj_1396:In 1983, Mr. Hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $150,000 bribe in a case before him, the central charge on which the Senate convicted him.
13/wsj_1396:With no floor debate, the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe, five votes more than needed.
13/wsj_1396:He was found not guilty of three charges, involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive, government investigation.
13/wsj_1396:Although Mr. Hastings had been acquitted by a jury, lawmakers handling the prosecution in Congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment isn't to punish an individual.
13/wsj_1396:Instead, they argued that impeachment aims to protect public institutions from people who have abused their positions of trust, irrespective of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases. 
13/wsj_1396:"Their opinion is devoid of the wisdom of the forefathers' teaching regarding impeachment," Mr. Hastings said.
13/wsj_1396:For the future, he said he would run for governor of Florida. 
13/wsj_1396:Mr. Hastings was appointed to the federal bench by President Carter in 1979 and was one of the few black federal judges in the country.
13/wsj_1396:While he packed the Senate gallery with his supporters during some of the impeachment trial, most civil rights groups kept their distance from his case. 
13/wsj_1396:Following the impeachment conviction, Dr. Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, issued a restrained statement, warning that the Hastings case could set a "dangerous precedent," but adding, "We must respect the considered judgment of the Senate." 
13/wsj_1397:When last we left him, FBI Agent Nick Mancuso had solved a murder mystery, unraveled a Washington political scandal, and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries "Favorite Son." What next for the crusty FBI agent with the heart of gold?
13/wsj_1397:A spinoff series, of course. 
13/wsj_1397:There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup: a nun raising some lovable orphans.
13/wsj_1397:A bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards. 
13/wsj_1397:Week by week on "Mancuso FBI" (NBC, Fridays, 10 p.m. ET), he pokes around the crime styles of the rich, famous and powerful of the Washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI. 
13/wsj_1397:Over the first few weeks, "Mancuso FBI" has sprung straight from the headlines, which is either a commendable stab at topicality, or a lack of imagination, or both.
13/wsj_1397:The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of womanizing (a la John Tower).
13/wsj_1397:If all of this seems a little stale, it's redeemed in part by some tricky plot twists: The usual suspects are found to be guilty, then not guilty, then guilty -- but of a different crime. (In last week's rape case, for example, the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest, and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case.) Most of all though, the show is redeemed by the character of Mancuso. 
13/wsj_1397:At the core of Mr. Loggia's Mancuso is his world-weary truculence.
13/wsj_1397:He's the kind of guy who rescues trampled flags. 
13/wsj_1397:To start, there's always a crisis -- and someone always worries, "What if the press gets a hold of this?" At least once an episode we see protestors marching around screaming slogans.
13/wsj_1397:At least once Mancuso's boss yells "In here -- now," and proceeds to dress his investigator down: "You are a dinosaur . . . a hangover in a $10 suit . . . One more word and you are out on a park bench, mister." Finally, of course, the boss gives in, but he's still yelling: "I find myself explaining anything to Teddy Kennedy, you'll be chasing stolen cars in Anchorage." 
13/wsj_1397:And Mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his lungs: "How the hell can you live with yourself?" he erupts at a politician. "You twist people's trust.
13/wsj_1397:There is a scene at the end of the first week's show where Mancuso attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead partner David.
13/wsj_1397:Asked to say a few words, he pulls out his crumpled piece of paper and tries to talk, but he's too choked up to get the words out.
13/wsj_1397:He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration, then turns and walks away.
13/wsj_1397:There's a pretty good program inside all the noise of "Mancuso FBI." If the show's creators could just let themselves be quiet for a little, they might just hear it. 
13/wsj_1398:With a Twist of the Wrist 
13/wsj_1398:Have a goal in common, all of them try 
13/wsj_1399:The White Plains, N.Y., oil company said Friday that it had acquired Tana Production Corp., a subsidiary of TRT Energy Holdings Inc., for $95.1 million in cash, with the rest to be paid in shares of a new, non-voting issue of preferred stock. 
13/wsj_1399:The fields contain recoverable reserves of 435 billion cubic feet of natural gas and four million barrels of oil. 
13/wsj_1399:"This acquisition is another indication of Texaco's commitment to increase the company's reserve base," said Chief Executive Officer James W. Kinnear. 
13/wsj_1399:At least two years ago, the company put 60 million barrels of oil reserves on the block.
13/wsj_1399:Not all of those parcels have yet been sold. 
13/wsj_1399:Texaco's situation had become particularly complex because much of its effort had for years been focused on its brawl with Pennzoil and then on New York investor Carl C. Icahn's attempt to take over the company. 
13/wsj_1399:Pennzoil had sued Texaco for improperly interfering with its acquisition of a portion of Getty Oil Co. Eventually, Texaco, which was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by that litigation, settled its fight with Pennzoil for $3 billion in 1986.
13/wsj_1399:Mr. Icahn, who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company, sold his stake in Texaco just last summer. 
13/wsj_1399:Completion of Texaco's acquisition of Tana is subject to government approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. 
14/wsj_1400:The change in expected cash distributions from the Champs real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs, said Jay R. Cohen, Champs executive vice president. 
14/wsj_1401:H&R BLOCK Inc. had net income of $100.2 million, or $1.90 a share, in the fiscal year ended April 30.
14/wsj_1402:Your Oct. 2 article on Daniel Yankelovich cited the quote "A good name is better than great riches" as being from Cervantes' "Don Quixote." Actually, Cervantes borrowed that quote from a writer of some 25 centuries earlier: Israel's King Solomon wrote those words in the Book of Proverbs (22:1). 
14/wsj_1403:Japan had an unadjusted trade surplus of $1.82 billion for the first 10 days of October, down from $3.16 billion a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said. 
14/wsj_1403:Imports rose sharply in the period, to $5.19 billion from $4.04 billion a year earlier, a change of 28%.
14/wsj_1404:Groupe AG's chairman said the Belgian insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to repel a raider. 
14/wsj_1404:Amid heavy buying of shares in Belgium's largest insurer, Maurice Lippens also warned in an interview that a white knight, in buying out a raider, could leave speculators with big losses on their AG stock.
14/wsj_1404:Since the beginning of the year, the stock has nearly doubled, giving AG a market value of about 105 billion Belgian francs ($2.7 billion). 
14/wsj_1404:The most likely white knight would be Societe Generale de Belgique S.A., which already owns 18% of AG and which itself is controlled by Cie.
14/wsj_1404:But Mr. Lippens said a rescue also could involve Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co., which owns 5% of AG. 
14/wsj_1404:Worried by European Community directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services, starting in mid-1990, insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars.
14/wsj_1404:In France, Suez and Axa-Midi Assurances S.A. both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions; Suez last month acquired control of Groupe Victoire, the sixth-largest European insurance company, after a takeover battle with Cie.
14/wsj_1404:Mr. Lippens said the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since mid-September.
14/wsj_1404:But he estimated that a raider would have been able to amass no more than 4% of the shares in recent months. 
14/wsj_1404:Aside from exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions, Mr. Lippens has called top managers of companies rumored as potential raiders -- among them, Axa-Midi, Union des Assurances de Paris and Suez, all based in France.
14/wsj_1404:They have all "very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of AG," he said. 
14/wsj_1404:A "syndicate" of shareholders holds just under 50% of AG, Mr. Lippens said, and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any AG shares. 
14/wsj_1405:With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in Panama, one of the many lingering questions the Bush administration will ponder is this: Is the National Security Council staff big enough, and does it have enough clout, to do its job of coordinating foreign policy? 
14/wsj_1405:Gen. Scowcroft was a member of the Tower Commission, which investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
14/wsj_1405:He was all too aware of how a large, inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan's second term. 
14/wsj_1405:So, following both the style he pursued as President Ford's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission, Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely, gathering the views of the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence community; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out. 
14/wsj_1405:The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be "small" and warned against letting "energetic self-starters" like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the State Department, Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency. 
14/wsj_1405:The NSC staff "doesn't have the horsepower that I believe is required to have an effective interagency process," says Frank Gaffney, a former Pentagon aide who now runs the Center for Security Policy, a conservative Washington think-tank. "The problem with this administration, I think, is that by design it has greatly diminished, both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense, the role of the NSC." 
14/wsj_1405:By law, the council includes the president, vice president and secretaries of state and defense.
14/wsj_1405:In practice, the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members. 
14/wsj_1405:But the size, shape and role of the NSC staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide.
14/wsj_1405:That task is one of Washington's perennial problems.
14/wsj_1405:In the Bush White House, the size of the NSC's staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987, administration officials say. 
14/wsj_1405:Administration officials insist that the size of the staff wasn't a problem during the Panama crisis.
14/wsj_1405:He had just resigned, at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson over the administration's policy on Panama and support for Nicaragua's Contra rebels. 
14/wsj_1405:The absence of Mr. Briggs underscored the possible inadequacy of the current NSC staff.
14/wsj_1405:Both have become confidants of President Bush. 
14/wsj_1405:In those areas, the role of NSC staffers under them therefore have become more important. 
14/wsj_1405:Gen. Scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that NSC staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced State Department and Pentagon bureaus.
14/wsj_1406:Japan's wholesale prices in the first 10 days of October fell 0.3% from the previous 10 days but rose 3.3% from a year ago, the Bank of Japan said. 
14/wsj_1407:Court documents filed by prosecutors indicate Mr. Tomlin tried to steer to Sperry a multimillion dollar contract to computerize maintenance of certain Navy electronics equiment.
14/wsj_1407:Documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that Mr. Lavelle and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained "approval of the scheme" from more-senior Sperry officials "because the payment which {Mr.} Tomlin requested was so large." Charles Gardner, a former Unisys vice president, and James Neal, a former company consultant, have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes.
14/wsj_1407:Unisys has said that all of the company officials who participated in improper activities have left the company. 
14/wsj_1407:Mr. Lavelle faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a $500,000 fine. 
14/wsj_1409:Matthew Lesko, something of a professional defender of government, thought he had a sure-fire winner last summer when he offered $5,000 for the best "verifiable story of 250 words or less about how a government bureaucrat helped you." 
14/wsj_1409:He sent out thousands of news releases from his Kensington, Md., office.
14/wsj_1409:After all, he says, "we've got like 15 million bureaucrats." And in addition to the $5,000, he has promised the winner a "My Favorite Bureaucrat" plaque and offered each of two runners-up $500. 
14/wsj_1409:To make matters worse, the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat: A woman from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance who nominated her boss. 
14/wsj_1410:Ford Motor Co. and Saab-Scania AB of Sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after Ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize Saab's car operations would outweigh the likely return. 
14/wsj_1410:With the collapse of the talks Friday, European analysts expect Ford to intensify its pursuit of British luxury car maker Jaguar PLC, which is scrambling to fend off a hostile Ford bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with Ford's archrival, General Motors Corp. 
14/wsj_1410:Individuals close to the Ford side of the negotiations said late last week that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the Swedish auto maker's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology.
14/wsj_1410:Some European analysts speculated that officials of Saab's highly profitable Scania truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy. 
14/wsj_1410:Saab's problems were underscored Friday when the company announced that its car division had a 1.2 billion kronor ($186.1 million) loss during the first eight months of this year, slightly worse than Saab-Scania had forecast in its first-half report last month.
14/wsj_1410:Overall, Saab-Scania's pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged 48.9% to 1 billion Swedish kronor ($155.1 million) from 1.96 billion kronor ($303.9 million) a year earlier. 
14/wsj_1410:Saab and Fiat have worked together in the past, in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of Saab's 9000 model, Fiat's Croma and Lancia's Thema.
14/wsj_1410:As for Ford, analysts expect the end of the Saab play will allow the U.S. auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with GM for a stake in Jaguar. 
14/wsj_1410:The failure of the Saab talks "makes it even more crucial for {Ford} to be victorious" in the Jaguar contest, said Stephen Reitman, European auto industry analyst at UBS-Phillips & Drew in London. 
14/wsj_1410:Jaguar executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with GM wrapped up by the end of the month.
14/wsj_1410:GM, meanwhile, is hosting a delegation of members of the British Parliament who are touring the auto maker's headquarter operations in Detroit.
14/wsj_1410:But Ford clearly views Jaguar as a prize worth fighting for, since the company's gilded brand image would give Ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both Europe and the U.S. Last week, Ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its U.S. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its German-built Scorpio sedan in the U.S. as a luxury import under the Merkur brand name. 
14/wsj_1410:So despite the GM-Jaguar romance, analysts say Ford by last Friday had boosted its Jaguar holding to about 11% of the luxury auto maker's shares outstanding from 10.4% early last week.
14/wsj_1411:The Dallas Cowboys are looking at a long-yardage situation, struggling to pull ahead of the Atlanta Falcons.
14/wsj_1411:There in the center of the pack is quarterback Troy Aikman, the key to the Cowboys' comeback strategy.
14/wsj_1411:With three minutes left on the clock, Mr. Aikman takes the snap, steps back and fires a 21-yard pass -- straight into the hands of an Atlanta defensive back.
14/wsj_1411:Ah, the glamour of professional sports.
14/wsj_1411:For Mr. Jones, losing his quarterback temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has beset the Dallas Cowboys -- and, this year, much of the National Football League.
14/wsj_1411:It has some of the highest costs in the league.
14/wsj_1411:Nearly half the owners of the 28 National Football League teams are losing money, the result of flat attendance, aging stadiums and -- more than anything -- skyrocketing salaries for star players like Mr. Aikman. 
14/wsj_1411:First-round draft picks have done even better: Average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $685,000 this year, up 44% from 1987. "It's a vicious circle," says Art Modell, owner of the Cleveland Browns. "One team pays so much and the other pays more.
14/wsj_1411:We just don't have that kind of income stream." 
14/wsj_1411:Though not intentionally, the Cowboys' Mr. Jones has come to represent this new breed of owner. 
14/wsj_1411:Shortly after buying 66% of the team from H.R. "Bum" Bright for $145 million, and mindful of the Cowboys' ragged bottom line, the 47-year-old Mr. Jones set about his own round of team cuts.
14/wsj_1411:In Dallas, Mr. Landry has a standing just shy of sainthood.
14/wsj_1411:He quickly cut the team's bloated administrative staff by half, shut down a Cowboys-owned dance academy and, in July, announced plans to sell Valley Ranch, the team's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the NFL. Mr. Jones calls the ranch "the Pentagon of Sportdom." It is a maze of halls that connects film rooms, elaborate spas and weight-training centers that testify to a richer, more free-spending era.
14/wsj_1411:He likes to tell the yarn of how he got lost on the expansive ranch during an early visit, took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help. "I said, `Somebody come get me.
14/wsj_1411:With a new day dawning on the sport, Mr. Jones doesn't see a place for this sort of luxury. "It's just not cost efficient," he says.
14/wsj_1411:After posting losing seasons in each of the last three years, the Cowboys needed a change, he says. 
14/wsj_1411:An Arkansas native, he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 University of Arkansas team that won a national championship.
14/wsj_1411:Years later, with cash from the sale of the insurance company, he founded Arkoma Production Corp., an oil and gas exploration company based in Little Rock. 
14/wsj_1411:He tapped Jimmy Johnson, a teammate on the 1964 University of Arkansas squad and the head coach at the University of Miami, where he led the Hurricanes to five winning seasons and a national championship in 1987.
14/wsj_1411:Whatever Mr. Johnson's talents, in the hearts and minds of many Dallas fans, he is no Tom Landry.
14/wsj_1411:He continues to reshuffle the team, trading famed running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks.
14/wsj_1411:The suites are air-conditioned, have wet bars and plush seating, and offer a clear view of the field -- all for a sale price of $475,000 to $1 million, depending on their size and location.
14/wsj_1411:Mr. Jones has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players, and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider's look at the team's strategy before game time.
14/wsj_1411:The sales job seems to be paying off: When he bought the team, only six of the suites had been sold.
14/wsj_1411:Gate receipts are only the Cowboys' second largest source of cash.
14/wsj_1411:The biggest is the NFL's contract with national television for broadcast of the league's games.
14/wsj_1411:Last year, the Cowboys' share of that pie came to $17.6 million.
14/wsj_1411:Details of the plan, which would go into effect in 1993, are sketchy, but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability.
14/wsj_1411:The NFL Players Association, meanwhile, contends that athletes are paid a wage commensurate with their ability to draw fans, and that some owners are in financial trouble because of poor business management, not players' salaries. 
14/wsj_1411:Most of the owners must pay up to 10% of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old.
14/wsj_1411:"We have the worst lease in the NFL," contends Michael B. McCaskey, the president of the Chicago Bears and a grandson of George Halas, who founded the NFL's predecessor organization. "We're in a metro area with millions of Bear fans, and only a small number can be accommodated." When the lease expires in 1999, he says, "It's got to be changed." 
14/wsj_1411:Like the game of professional football, the NFL organization itself is in turmoil.
14/wsj_1411:The new breed of team owner, Mr. Jones included, has been fighting the NFL bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs, and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock.
14/wsj_1411:In July, 11 NFL owners, almost all of them new, blocked an effort to install Jim Finks as a replacement for retiring league commissioner Pete Rozelle.
14/wsj_1411:He puts in busy six-day weeks (excluding game days), and on one recent afternoon fielded questions, in the course of an hour, from a TV producer, his luxury-suite marketing manager, a disgruntled customer and a roomful of Arkansas reporters.
14/wsj_1411:Besides, to a large extent, Mr. Jones may already be getting what he wants out of the team, even though it keeps losing.
14/wsj_1411:There is the new private jet, the platoon of assistants, invitations to the best parties, and television appearances on shows such as "Prime Time Live." A few weeks ago, Mr. Jones even entertained Elizabeth Taylor in his private suite at Texas Stadium. 
14/wsj_1412:How interestingly clever of Robert Goldberg to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism to explain his perception of "Days of Rage" in his television critique (Leisure & Arts, Sept 11).
14/wsj_1412:He chastises Jo Franklin-Trout for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism, judging her project as "intellectually slipshod." Was not the title very clear?
14/wsj_1412:Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment; of course the Israelis feel put upon.
14/wsj_1412:But his complaint that "Days of Rage" doesn't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving is irrelevant.
14/wsj_1412:This film did emphasize how long the Israeli/Palestinian stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to the days of World War I when the British tried to guarantee both a Jewish state and a Palestinian state without specifying how it was to be done. 
14/wsj_1412:Well, "Days of Rage" airing with before-and-after packaging, and after repeated delays, was a beginning.
14/wsj_1412:Now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only. 
14/wsj_1413:Mr. Bush asked Congress to raise to $6 billion from $3 billion the amount of money Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may shift among the Pentagon's individual programs, projects and activities, allowing him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict. 
14/wsj_1413:If the request is approved by both the House and Senate, Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget to move the money, according to Senate budget analysts. 
14/wsj_1413:That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has. "It's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs," said Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.) of the Senate Budget Committee, who said he would oppose the request. "That isn't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm-Rudman is supposed to impose," he said. 
14/wsj_1413:Last week, Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $16.1 billion spending reduction, half of which must come from defense, to "impose a little bit more discipline" by applying cuts to each individual program, project or activity in the budget.
14/wsj_1413:Under the deficit-reduction law, 4.3% of the Pentagon's money and 5.3% of other agencies' money has been canceled.
14/wsj_1414:Rochester Telephone Corp. said it completed its purchase of Urban Telephone Corp., of Clintonville, Wis., the second-largest unaffiliated independent telephone company in that state. 
14/wsj_1414:Rochester Telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of Urban Telephone, but a price wasn't disclosed. 
14/wsj_1414:Since June, Rochester Telephone signed letters of intent to purchase three other Wisconsin firms. 
14/wsj_1415:A bill that would permit the Securities and Exchange Commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some Wall Street firms, which argue that the legislation is unnecessary. 
14/wsj_1415:The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and the Senate Securities Subcommittee. 
14/wsj_1415:Richard Breeden, the new chairman of the SEC, hasn't taken a formal position on the bill, which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the SEC additional authority during market emergencies.
14/wsj_1415:However, he recently told the Senate Banking Committee that he believes the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker-dealers, which are frequently used to issue bridge loans. 
14/wsj_1415:Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds, the recent woes of the junk-bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with Wall Street firms issuing bridge loans. 
14/wsj_1415:First Boston, whose holding company, CS First Boston Group, is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on Wall Street, said it is also concerned that once the SEC has the power to monitor holding companies, it will try to regulate their activities. 
14/wsj_1415:"The proposal, while well-intended, I think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken, rather than strengthen the control the SEC has exercised for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker-dealers," Michael Raoul-Duval, managing director of First Boston, said in an interview. 
14/wsj_1415:The bill would "divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers," Mr. Raoul-Duval said. 
14/wsj_1415:An aide to the Senate Securities Subcommittee says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure, but adds: "nobody is wedded to the language in the bill." 
14/wsj_1415:Edward O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry Association, said that the securities-industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is "hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the SEC's goals." 
14/wsj_1416:This letter was inspired by David Asman's Sept. 25 editorial-page article about Fidel Castro, "Man in the Middle of Drug Trafficking." 
14/wsj_1416:I've organized a series of exchanges, exhibitions and other continuing projects between Cuban and American artists.
14/wsj_1416:Despite levels of obstruction, incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion, these projects all remain, in my mind, valuable and well worth the effort.
14/wsj_1416:Those "people" to whom I refer are not some heroic, indecipherable quantity; they are artists, critics, taxi drivers, grandmothers, even some employees of the Ministry of Culture, all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution, spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society, reverence for education and creative expression, universal rights to health and livelihood, housing, etc.
14/wsj_1416:In fact, the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara's famous linkages of art, idealism and revolution seem modest.
14/wsj_1416:It is on behalf of these people, and out of my real respect for them, that I am responding to Mr. Asman's opinions of their country. 
14/wsj_1416:The Ochoa trial in July, with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption, and the summary trial and execution, was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of Cuba.
14/wsj_1416:It is naivete to equate a government's policies with the will of the people (as we well know), and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of Fidel and the military and the state bureaucracy.
14/wsj_1416:I think it's a little disingenuous to be surprised that Fidel doesn't invite the U.S. State Department to violate the jurisdiction of the Cuban government over its own territory. 
14/wsj_1416:We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom.
14/wsj_1416:Without this basic level of attention to reality, our policies on Cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years.
14/wsj_1416:From my own point of view, given the qualities of humanity, creativity and warm spirit in which the Cuban people excel, we deny ourselves access to things we hold dear, and which seem to run in such short supply these days.
14/wsj_1417:ENGRAPH INC. recently reported third-quarter earnings, which were mistakenly shown in the Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in last Tuesday's edition to be lower than the average of analysts' estimates.
14/wsj_1417:Engraph's third-quarter net income of 15 cents a share actually was 7% higher than the adjusted average of estimates. 
14/wsj_1418:Investors bailed out of New York City bonds in droves last week, driving prices lower and boosting yields. 
14/wsj_1418:One bond trader estimated that more than $50 million of New York City general obligation bonds were put up for sale Friday alone.
14/wsj_1418:While that represents a small percentage of the city's public debt outstanding, Friday's selling followed a weeklong effort to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual investors. 
14/wsj_1418:"I've never seen so many {New York City} G.O.'s up for sale," said another trader. "Every broker has blocks of every size and maturity." 
14/wsj_1418:Municipal bond analysts said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the city's financial health, rumors of a $900 million bond offering coming soon, and political uncertainty. 
14/wsj_1418:A spokesman for the city wouldn't confirm the size of the bond issue, but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks, before the November mayoral election. (General obligation bonds are backed by the city's overall revenues and credit.) 
14/wsj_1418:Although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled, many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold.
14/wsj_1418:The fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that New York's budgetary problems are more serious than had been expected.
14/wsj_1418:New York, one of the nation's largest issuers of tax-exempt bonds, sold $750 million of municipal bonds just a few weeks ago. 
14/wsj_1418:At present, analysts project a budget gap on the order of $500 million to $600 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1990, although the city's own budget analysts project a narrower deficit. 
14/wsj_1418:Mark Page, New York's deputy director of finance, said that investors' concerns about the city's financial health are "unwarranted given our proven ability to manage ourselves." He charges the city's critics with spreading "unfounded emotional rhetoric." 
14/wsj_1418:And the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election.
14/wsj_1418:"The market can adjust to good news or bad news, but uncertainty drives people wild," said Bernard B. Beal, chief executive of M.R. Beal & Co., a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market.
14/wsj_1418:Until last week, "Everyone felt certain they knew the outcome of the election.
14/wsj_1418:Now, there have been a number of questions raised." 
14/wsj_1418:As the yield on New York general obligation bonds rose, the Bond Buyer 20-bond general obligation index, the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax-exempt market, held steady at 7.19% in the week ended Oct. 19. 
14/wsj_1419:Qintex Australia Ltd. encountered another setback Friday when its Los Angeles-based affiliate, Qintex Entertainment Inc., filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
14/wsj_1419:Earlier this month, Qintex Australia's $1.5 billion agreement to acquire MGM/UA Communications Co. collapsed because of a dispute over a $50 million letter of credit the Australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction.
14/wsj_1419:Mr. Evans had been the de facto head of MGM/UA for months. 
14/wsj_1419:Qintex Entertainment, a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its co-production of the hit miniseries "Lonesome Dove," said it filed for Chapter 11 protection after Qintex Australia failed to provide it with $5.9 million owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of "The New Leave It to Beaver Show." 
14/wsj_1419:After the announcement of the bankruptcy filing, Qintex Entertainment stock sank $2.625 in over-the-counter trading to close at $1.50 on heavy volume of more than 1.4 million shares.
14/wsj_1419:Jonathan Lloyd, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Qintex Entertainment, said Qintex Entertainment was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with MCA.
14/wsj_1419:MCA on Friday said that as a result of Qintex's failure to make the required payment it was terminating the distribution agreement on "The New Leave It to Beaver" as well as other MCA properties. 
14/wsj_1419:Qintex Australia was "saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation.
14/wsj_1419:In a prepared statement from Australia, the company also said that, following the breakdown of the MGM talks, it "had been re-evaluating its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of Qintex Entertainment" and had "resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to Qintex Entertainment in excess of that previously made." 
14/wsj_1419:The report of the bankruptcy filing stunned Hollywood executives and investors. "It's a shocker," said Joseph Di Lillo, chairman of Drake Capital Securities, a brokerage firm that has an investment in Qintex Entertainment.
14/wsj_1419:Qintex Australia was "going to pay more than $1 billion for MGM/UA and then they couldn't come up with the far smaller sum of $5.9 million." 
14/wsj_1419:Mr. Kimmel was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since 1980. 
14/wsj_1419:It isn't a current topic of conversation at the company," said Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive officer of the Fox Inc. unit of News Corp. 
14/wsj_1421:Makoto Utsumi, vice minister for international affairs, said the ministry didn't in any way suggest to Japanese banks that they stay out of the UAL Corp. leveraged buy-out.
14/wsj_1421:The ministry has never even suggested that Japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general, Mr. Utsumi said. "There are no facts {behind the assertions} that we sent any kind of signal," he declared in an interview. 
14/wsj_1421:A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in New York stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the UAL deal for one reason or another. 
14/wsj_1421:Mr. Utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask Japanese banks about "the status of their participation" in one previous U.S. leveraged buy-out.
14/wsj_1421:The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was "being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress" and it was "necessary for us to grasp the situation." He said the inquiry wasn't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation, and he added that none of the Japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry. 
14/wsj_1421:Although some of the Japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for UAL bowed out because they found the terms unattractive, observers here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason.
14/wsj_1421:At a news conference this week, Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita cautioned banks to take a "prudent" stance regarding highly leveraged deals.
14/wsj_1421:While recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever, Japanese banks aren't likely to walk away from the game.
14/wsj_1421:Jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to leapfrog the problem of not having a strong retail-banking network. 
14/wsj_1422:"We aren't Philip Morris Cos.," says Bertrand de Galle, chairman of government-owned Societe Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs & Allumettes S.A., known as Seita.
14/wsj_1422:He says that because Seita's profits are limited by government-controlled cigarette prices, he doesn't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the U.S. concern has done. (Last year, for example, Seita's net profit soared 150% to 461.6 million French francs ($73.5 million) on sales of FFr27.68 billion-a 1.7% profit margin.) 
14/wsj_1422:Instead, he said in an interview, he is looking for ways to exploit France's network of 39,000 tobacco agents, most of them cafes.
14/wsj_1422:Instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines, which deliver little paper receipts, drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops.
14/wsj_1422:It wanted to buy RJR Nabisco Inc. 's French cracker subsidiary, Belin, in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores, but lost the bidding to food group BSN SA.
14/wsj_1422:Brown-tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises now make up just 40% of the French tobacco market, half the level of about two decades ago.
14/wsj_1423:Reproductive Health Services, illustrates how Supreme Court rulings often have a ripple effect, spreading into areas of law and policy that weren't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices. 
14/wsj_1423:In the Missouri case, unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state's 1986 abortion law.
14/wsj_1423:Last year, a federal appeals court in St. Louis said the preamble was unconstitutional, citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling that states can't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins.
14/wsj_1423:But the Supreme Court concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life hadn't yet been used to restrict abortion services. 
14/wsj_1423:The protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children.
14/wsj_1423:Under a 1981 Missouri law, persons accused of some crimes, including trespassing, may offer a defense that their actions were justified "as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury." Relying on the preamble's statement that a fetus is an unborn child, the two St. Louis County Circuit Court judges in August accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives. 
14/wsj_1423:In another case, a protester, Ann O'Brien, was convicted of trespass before the Supreme Court's Webster ruling.
14/wsj_1423:Last week, when her appeal was argued before the Missouri Court of Appeals, her lawyer also relied on the preamble. 
14/wsj_1423:"The effect of the Supreme Court Webster opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of Roe vs.
14/wsj_1423:Wade, and I think this is one of the cracks," said Mark Belz, a St. Louis lawyer who represented Ms. O'Brien and the other St. Louis protesters.
14/wsj_1423:Mario Mandina, president of Kansas City Lawyers for Life, says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass, "This will shut down abortion in Missouri.
14/wsj_1423:That would be an ironic result of a case in which the Supreme Court expressly stopped short of overruling Roe vs.
14/wsj_1423:In two other cases, the possible consequences of the Supreme Court ruling appear even more unintended. 
14/wsj_1423:In one, the lawyer for a 20-year-old resident of Columbia, Mo., who was charged with drunk driving, argued that his client should be treated as a 21-year-old adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception, not from birth.
14/wsj_1423:In Missouri, those caught drinking and driving between the ages of 16 and 21 may have their licenses revoked for one year, while those 21 or older suffer only a 30-day suspension.
14/wsj_1423:And in a case filed in federal court in August, a lawyer is arguing that Missouri authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and forgery. 
14/wsj_1424:In terms of sheer brutality, the Somali regime of Siad Barre may rank as No. 1 in the world.
14/wsj_1424:The only reason that Somalia remains in obscurity is numbers: a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of Texas.
14/wsj_1424:The Barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill. 
14/wsj_1424:Beheading small children, stabbing elderly people to death, raping and shooting women, and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the Somali armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years. 
14/wsj_1424:Up to 500,000 Somalis have escaped to the relative safety of Marxist Ethiopia because of the behavior of President Barre's troops. 
14/wsj_1424:In the port of Berbera, for example, hundreds of men of the rival Issak clan were rounded up in May 1988, imprisoned, and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever.
14/wsj_1424:The horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report, based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees.
14/wsj_1424:The study was done by Robert Gersony, a consultant to the U.S. State Department who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the left-right ideological divide. 
14/wsj_1424:What gives these events particular significance, however, is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the horn of Africa.
14/wsj_1424:Desperate, he has called in the Libyans to help fight the rebels of the Somali National Movement in the north, which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of Mogadishu.
14/wsj_1424:Seventy years old and a self-declared "scientific socialist," President Barre has a power base, composed only of his minority Mareham clan, that according to observers is "narrowing." 
14/wsj_1424:The U.S.'s interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera, which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.
14/wsj_1424:That strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story, air-conditioned shacks where a handful of American nationals -- buttressed by imported food, cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated -- maintain radio contact with the outside world.
14/wsj_1424:In the past two years, the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy, where, due to Mr. Barre's brutality and ineptitude, nobody is any longer in control. 
14/wsj_1424:As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia, the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets' array of airfields next door.
14/wsj_1424:On Sept. 7, I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas.
14/wsj_1424:Recently, in Wollo province in the center of Ethiopia, Tigrean forces have killed, wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops. (Think what these numbers mean -- considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in Lebanon, a small country of little strategic importance!) 
14/wsj_1424:Tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of Addis Ababa, threatening the town of Dese, which would cut off Mr. Mengistu's capital from the port of Assab, through which all fuel and other supplies reach Addis Ababa.
14/wsj_1424:As a result, Mr. Mengistu has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from Eritrea just to hold the town, thereby risking the loss of even more territory in Eritrea only to keep the Tigreans at bay. 
14/wsj_1424:Mr. Mengistu is in an increasingly weak position: Half his army is tied down defending the northern city of Asmara from the Eritreans.
14/wsj_1424:While the Tigreans are communists, like the Eritreans they are among the most anti-Soviet guerrillas in the world, having suffered more than a decade of aerial bombardment by the Soviet-supplied Mengistu air force. 
14/wsj_1424:The U.S., therefore, has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in Somalia and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late 1970s on the Horn of Africa. 
14/wsj_1424:Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway, the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the Bush administration to blast the regime publicly, in terms clear enough for all influential Somalis to understand.
14/wsj_1424:While the State Department positions itself for the post-Barre period in Somalia, it should continue to back former President Carter's well-intentioned role as a mediator between Mr. Mengistu and the Eritrean guerrillas in Ethiopia, while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the Tigrean rebels through neighboring Sudan. 
14/wsj_1424:Ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated, secretive and Byzantine in all of black Africa.
14/wsj_1424:It's not just in Eastern Europe where the march of events is finally on the U.S. side, but on the horn of Africa as well.
14/wsj_1424:The only U.S. liability in the region is what remains of the link to Mr. Barre, and that should be cut fast. 
14/wsj_1424:Mr. Kaplan, author of "Surrender or Starve: The Wars Behind the Famine" (Westview Press, 1988), lives in Lisbon. 
14/wsj_1426:McCormick Capital Inc. said the final proration factor was 0.628394 on its oversubscribed, $3-a-share tender offer to buy back as many as 1.1 million of its common shares. 
14/wsj_1426:McCormick is a developer and manager of futures-investment limited partnerships. 
14/wsj_1426:Through a separate agreement between Peter Dauchy, president, and a group of selling shareholders, the company said, Mr. Dauchy will on Oct. 30 buy 231,405 shares from the group, boosting his stake to about 717,000 shares, or 50.7% of the total after the buy-back. 
14/wsj_1427:The rise followed boosts of 0.1% in August, 0.7% in July and 0.6% in June. 
14/wsj_1428:Output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out.
14/wsj_1428:But industry and OPEC officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse a few months from now if OPEC doesn't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters. 
14/wsj_1428:OPEC is currently producing more than 22 million barrels a day, sharply above its nominal, self-imposed fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million, according to OPEC and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the Oil Daily and the International Herald Tribune.
14/wsj_1428:At that rate, a majority of OPEC's 13 members have reached their output limits, they said. 
14/wsj_1428:But it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day -- and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day -- of spare capacity still exists within OPEC.
14/wsj_1428:Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves, such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq, could upset the market. 
14/wsj_1428:However, in interviews later, both ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member. 
14/wsj_1428:Under that approach, countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC's production ceiling than they would under the current system. "If you are already producing at 95% or 100% of your capacity, what's the good to be told you can produce at 105% of capacity?" asked Mr. Al-Chalabi. 
14/wsj_1428:At an inconclusive Geneva meeting late last month, OPEC's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling.
14/wsj_1428:The main effect of the ceiling boost was to "legitimize" some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters. 
14/wsj_1428:Previously, no OPEC member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group's total output target, or ceiling.
14/wsj_1428:But the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity, advanced there in an Iranian proposal, was generally endorsed by the ministers. 
14/wsj_1428:The ceiling would be lifted to 21.5 million barrels to provide Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others.
14/wsj_1428:Insisting on a 24.5% share of any ceiling, Saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members.
14/wsj_1428:In Geneva, however, they supported Iran's proposal because it would have left the Saudi percentage of the OPEC total intact, and increased actual Saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million. 
14/wsj_1428:Some of the proposed modifications since, however, call on Saudi Arabia to "give back" to the production-sharing pool a token 23,000 barrels.
14/wsj_1428:Mr. Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of OPEC production under any quota revisions. "Under any circumstances, Saudi Arabia should get more" rather than less, Mr. Nazer said. 
14/wsj_1429:Adm. Goupil said the navy can't wait until 1998, when the naval Rafale becomes available, to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders, used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack.
14/wsj_1429:Although they never said so publicly, they have made no secret of their preference for the F-18 on operational grounds. 
14/wsj_1429:Adm. Goupil's comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of Dassault.
14/wsj_1429:The Rafale project is the result of France's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries, and French officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs.
14/wsj_1429:Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement told a meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association that the question of modernizing the Crusaders or buying used F18s is a "political" decision that he will make in due time. 
14/wsj_1431:Spending by average Japanese households in August fell an adjusted 1.9% from a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau of the Prime Minister's Office said. 
14/wsj_1431:The real income of wage-earning families in the month eased 1.2% to 438,845 yen from the previous year. 
14/wsj_1432:The first signs of trouble came last month when the Hong Kong carrier, a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Ltd., posted a 5% drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year. 
14/wsj_1432:Securities analysts, many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing Cathay's interim figures, believe more jolts lie ahead.
14/wsj_1432:In addition, delivery delays for the first two of as many as 28 Boeing 747-400s that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes.
14/wsj_1432:There also is concern that once Hong Kong reverts to China's sovereignty in 1997, Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to China's often-disparaged flag carrier, Civil Aviation Administration of China, or CAAC. 
14/wsj_1432:Sarah Hall, an analyst at James Capel (Far East) Ltd., says there isn't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel, Hong Kong's tight labor market, or the strengthening of the local currency, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar.
14/wsj_1432:In 1988, it earned $2.82 billion Hong Kong (US$361.5 million) on revenue of HK$11.79 billion. 
14/wsj_1432:The expansion, which could cost as much as US$5.7 billion over the next eight years, will expand the fleet to about 43 planes by 1991, up from 30 at the end of last year, according to Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd. 
14/wsj_1432:The fuel-efficient Airbus planes will be used largely to replace Cathay's aging fleet of Lockheed Tristars for regional flights, while the Boeing aircraft will be used on long-haul routes to Europe and North America. 
14/wsj_1432:Cathay also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside Hong Kong.
14/wsj_1432:Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay's labor costs by 20% a year for low-level staff, while experienced, skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain.
14/wsj_1432:David Bell, a spokesman for the airline, says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997. 
14/wsj_1432:Mr. Eddington regards promoting Hong Kong as an important part of attracting visitors from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged. 
14/wsj_1432:Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly Cathay's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important part of Cathay's strategy.
14/wsj_1432:Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis, particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers. 
14/wsj_1432:Asian traffic, which currently accounts for 65% of Cathay's business, is expected to continue as the carrier's mainstay.
14/wsj_1432:While a large number of Hong Kong companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of 1997, such a move isn't an option for Cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in Hong Kong.
14/wsj_1433:Falcon Cable Systems Co. said it proposed an amendment that would allow it to increase its debt cap to 65% of the company's fair market value from the 40% currently allowed.
14/wsj_1434:Reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $1 million or more.
14/wsj_1434:COMMERCIAL PAPER: High-grade unsecured notes sold through dealers by major corporations in multiples of $1,000: 8.55% 30 days; 8.45% 60 days; 8.40% 90 days.

14/wsj_1434:TREASURY BILLS: Results of the Monday, October 16, 1989, auction of short-term U.S. government bills, sold at a discount from face value in units of $10,000 to $1 million: 7.37% 13 weeks; 7.42% 26 weeks. 
14/wsj_1434:Annualized average rate of return after expenses for the past 30 days; not a forecast of future returns. 
14/wsj_1435:-- Saturday morning, a resident was given 15 minutes to scurry into a sagging building and reclaim what she could of her life's possessions.
14/wsj_1435:Saturday night she dined in an emergency shelter on salmon steaks prepared by chefs from one of the city's four-star restaurants. 
14/wsj_1435:-- Mayor Art Agnos stands in the glare of television lights trying to explain for the 20th time why the city is severely restricting access to badly damaged structures.
14/wsj_1435:A couple in fashionable spandex warm-up suits jogs by, headphones jauntily in place, weaving their way along a street of fractured and fallen houses.
14/wsj_1435:-- A young woman who has been out of town shows up at the Marina Middle School to learn that her apartment is on the condemned list.
14/wsj_1435:Nearby, five temporary residents of the school shelter sit on stools, having their necks and backs kneaded by volunteer masseuses. 
14/wsj_1435:She finds the response of Marina residents -- primarily yuppies and elderly people -- to the devastation of their homes "incredible.
14/wsj_1435:People have been very respectful of each other.
14/wsj_1435:Out on the streets, some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a 15-minute scavenger hunt through their possessions. "It's so weird to have to decide what's really important to you," said Barbara May.
14/wsj_1435:Reds and yellows went about their business with a kind of measured grimness.
14/wsj_1435:It didn't help that on Saturday, after three days of sunshine, it rained. 
14/wsj_1435:"The guys are going for their skis, their stereos, their personal computers," said Frank Fitzgerald, who helped others empty their apartments. "The women wanted photo albums, a certain brooch, kind of sentimental things." He showed an unbroken, still-ticking pocket watch that he retrieved for one woman.
14/wsj_1435:Enforcement of restricted-entry rules was sporadic, residents said.
14/wsj_1435:One man trying to remove his car was told by officials to get out of his garage.
14/wsj_1435:The Marina also has become the focal point of city efforts to reunite residents with any pets that may have fled or become lost during the earthquake.
14/wsj_1435:The San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also has been providing medical care, food, water and foster homes for quake-displaced animals.
14/wsj_1435:The SPCA says it has received more than 100 requests for foster homes on behalf of dogs and cats, though some people have sought temporary homes for birds and fish. 
14/wsj_1436:The neighborhood around Alexander Haagen Co. 's Vermont-Slauson Shopping Center in the Watts section of Los Angeles resembles the crime-ridden, deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly isn't the sort of area one would choose to visit.
14/wsj_1436:But turn into the shopping center's parking lot, and one could be in the safe, busy mall of a prosperous suburb.
14/wsj_1436:Over the past year there have been only one burglary, three thefts of or from autos, no purse-snatchings, and one attempted robbery in the mall, which opened in late 1981.
14/wsj_1436:A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would, per year, be expected to have eight burglaries, 70 thefts of or from autos, and four robberies.
14/wsj_1436:The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $350 per leasable square foot; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $200.
14/wsj_1436:A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern, in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth, gangs, and the criminal element, with an erosion of the customer base, development capital, and insurability.
14/wsj_1436:Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents. 
14/wsj_1436:The center improves the community image to outsiders as well, and may help to arrest, or even reverse, the exodus of capital and investment. 
14/wsj_1436:An additional benefit is the creation of jobs.
14/wsj_1436:This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers.
14/wsj_1436:It continues through the life of the center; the Vermont-Slauson Center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $2,500 per job.
14/wsj_1436:As many of these jobs are filled by local residents, who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls, the $2,500-per-job public investment should repay itself in a few years.
14/wsj_1436:And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales, real estate, licenses and the like. 
14/wsj_1436:Profits are also plowed back into the community; the non-profit Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp. receives 60% of the profits from the Vermont-Slauson Center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community -- now running into the hundreds of units -- as well as commercial and industrial development projects. 
14/wsj_1436:Bradford Crowe, director of the mayor's City Economic Development Office, says: "There is no question that Vermont-Slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood.
14/wsj_1436:What had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock, thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that Vermont-Slauson yields." 
14/wsj_1436:Another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women.
14/wsj_1436:In the Grand Boulevard Plaza developed by Matanky Realty Group in Chicago's Third Ward, opposite the Robert Taylor Homes, 29% of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and 14% to members of other minority groups.
14/wsj_1436:Primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time, patience, breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess.
14/wsj_1436:One of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies, local political leaders, and citizen groups, and with prospective tenants and sources of financing.
14/wsj_1436:Suburban deals are not without their delays and complications -- inner-city deals just have more of them. 
14/wsj_1436:The entire site is enclosed by a 6-to-8-foot-high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote-controlled gates.
14/wsj_1436:The security command post, camouflaged as second-story retail space, has its own "crow's nest" above the roofs of the other buildings, with a panoramic view of the entire center.
14/wsj_1436:Haagen has its own large security force of well-trained and well-paid personnel on round-the-clock duty at each center.
14/wsj_1436:Security is 60% to 70% of the common area charges of these centers, vs. an industry average of about 15%. 
14/wsj_1436:Many of these programs no longer exist, or have been severely cut back.
14/wsj_1436:Many states already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives, loans, and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities.
14/wsj_1436:These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning, identifying sources of funds, and for acquiring a site and preparing it.
14/wsj_1436:Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date. 
14/wsj_1436:Mr. Titus is a researcher at the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice. 
14/wsj_1437:ATHLONE INDUSTRIES Inc. said that on Dec. 21 it will redeem $10 million face amount of its $59.3 million of 15.625% subordinated notes outstanding, due June 1, 1991.
14/wsj_1437:For each $1,000 of notes, the maker of specialty metals, industrial fasteners and consumer products will pay $1,026.46 plus $8.68 of interest accrued from Dec. 1.
14/wsj_1437:The company will notify holders of the notes to be redeemed.
14/wsj_1438:The new closed-end management investment company trades shares of beneficial interest.
14/wsj_1438:Exabyte Corp., a Boulder, Colo., maker of high-capacity tape cartridge systems used to back up computer disk drives, started OTC trading with the symbol EXBT. 
14/wsj_1438:It operates various types of addiction-treatment facilities.
14/wsj_1438:Separately, on the Pacific Stock Exchange, put and call options on the common stock of Aldus Corp. started trading.
14/wsj_1438:Options give a holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a set price within a set period of time. 
14/wsj_1439:Dow, of Midland, Mich., said its unit will begin by Thursday a tender offer of $12.25 a share for all PSE common shares outstanding.
14/wsj_1439:Among other conditions, the offer depends on the Dow unit acquiring at least 66 2/3% of the PSE shares outstanding, the companies said in a joint statement Friday. 
14/wsj_1439:The company said the approximately $115 million acquisition price includes its total $33 million of long-term debt outstanding.
14/wsj_1439:Dow said it already has agreements with Albert J. Smith Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of PSE, and certain other officers of the company under which Dow may buy about 40% of the PSE common shares outstanding. 
14/wsj_1439:PSE is a designer and operator of energy-cogeneration facilities and had 1988 sales of $234 million.
14/wsj_1440:If growth regains its glamour among investors, a sluggish segment of the Nasdaq over-the-counter market could show some flash. 
14/wsj_1440:Some stock pickers already are targeting the OTC market, where, they say, await plenty of small- and medium-sized growth stocks.
14/wsj_1440:Best of all, they add, these growth issues, unlike their big blue-chip cousins on the New York Stock Exchange, are languishing at depressed prices. 
14/wsj_1440:Growth stocks will return to favor, some analysts and money managers think, because of the jitters caused by the market's steep slide on Oct. 13, and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements.
14/wsj_1440:Against such a backdrop, companies with proven track records of earnings gains of 20% or so annually have extra appeal. 
14/wsj_1440:Like many OTC growth issues, they have market values -- as measured by stock price times shares outstanding -- of roughly $100 million to $500 million. 
14/wsj_1440:"You can find some good, quality companies over the counter," but investors should be selective, says John Palicka, chief portfolio manager at Midco Investors, a Newark, N.J., money management company with about $900 million invested in growth stocks of varying sizes.
14/wsj_1440:The main argument for growth stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing economy. "If the market refocuses on earnings, we should get better valuations of growth stocks," says L. Keith Mullins, a growth-stock analyst at Morgan Stanley.
14/wsj_1440:Eventually, he believes, investors will be willing to pay higher prices for companies with proven track records of earnings growth.
14/wsj_1440:In anticipation of that shift, he and other analysts are encouraging their clients to buy such issues now. 
14/wsj_1440:The average issue on Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index gained 35% last year, Ms. Farrell of PaineWebber says.
14/wsj_1440:In addition, earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow, restructuring and takeover potential, and breakup value as the preferred stock-picking standards for much of the year.
14/wsj_1440:As a result, Morgan Stanley's Index of 40 Emerging Growth Stocks -- most of which are in the OTC market -- is up only 13% for the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has leaped 24% and the S&P 500 has grown 25%.
14/wsj_1440:Some investors are skeptical of growth stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance isn't indicative of future results. "People are naturally suspicious of them," says Mr. Mullins of Morgan Stanley.
14/wsj_1440:Mark Schoeppner, portfolio manager at Pittsburgh-based Quaker Capital Management, says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions, analysts and investors now appear to be "valuing stock based on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt the company can support." 
14/wsj_1440:Barney Hallingby, managing director of research at Hambrecht & Quist, also believes earnings growth is beginning to play a greater part in investors' buying decisions.
14/wsj_1440:On Friday, Hambrecht & Quist added St. Jude Medical to the list of 20 stocks it strongly recommends.
14/wsj_1440:Valley National lost 1 3/8 to 17 1/8 on volume of 1.9 million shares.
14/wsj_1440:Merchants Bank of New York lost 1 to 106 after reporting that its third-quarter net income fell to $1.62 a share from last year's $1.67 a share. 
14/wsj_1440:Eliot Savings Bank lost 7/8 to 1 5/8 after reporting that it had a $4.8 million loss in the latest third quarter mostly because of loan-loss provisions.
14/wsj_1440:The company's shares began trading at 12 1/2, up from its initial offering price of 12, and closed at 13.
14/wsj_1440:Qintex Entertainment dropped 2 5/8 to 1 1/2 after seeking protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code for itself and its two operating subsidiaries, Hal Roach Studios and Qintex Productions. 
14/wsj_1440:Raymond Corp. lost 1 to 10 after it said late Thursday that it will take a $4.4 million charge in its third quarter for reserves to cover potential charges in connection with the closing and sale of a manufacturing plant.
14/wsj_1440:McCaw said it has secured commitments from three banks to help finance its $125-a-share bid for 22 million of Lin's shares.
14/wsj_1440:McCaw has called for a "fair auction" of LIN, which earlier entered a stock-swap merger pact with BellSouth. 
14/wsj_1440:Following the release of the company's fourth-quarter earnings, Apple Computer dropped 3/4 to 48 on volume of more than 2.3 million shares.
14/wsj_1440:Apple earned $161.1 million, or $1.24 a share, in the quarter, including $48 million from the sale of its Adobe Systems stock. 
14/wsj_1441:Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. -- $475 million of senior subordinated resettable debentures, due Oct. 15, 2001, priced at par to yield 14.75%.
14/wsj_1441:The coupon will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101.
14/wsj_1441:Debenture holders will also receive the equivalent of 10% of the common stock of CNW Holdings.
14/wsj_1441:The equity kicker is not attached to the offering, but underwriters said it will be offered after a filing for 68,548 common shares of CNW Holdings is declared effective by the Securities & Exchange Commission.
14/wsj_1441:The issue is noncallable for five years and has a sinking fund starting in 2000 to retire 50% of the issue before maturity.
14/wsj_1441:Tokuyama Soda Co. (Japan) -- $200 million of Eurobonds due Nov. 9, 1993, with equity-purchase warrants, indicating a 4% coupon at par, via Nomura International Ltd.
14/wsj_1441:Each $5,000 bond carries one warrant, exercisable from Nov. 28, 1989, through Oct. 28, 1993, to buy company shares at an expected premium of 2 1/2% to the closing share price when terms are fixed Oct. 27. 
14/wsj_1442:On Friday, Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp said it expects a net loss of $16 million for the third quarter of 1989 because of hemorrhaging at its First Interstate Bank of Arizona unit.
14/wsj_1442:It charged off an estimated $200 million of Arizona loans, leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of $255 million, about 61% of its $416 million of troubled loans and repossessed real estate. 
14/wsj_1442:The action capped a spurt of grim Arizona banking news for the third quarter, and emphatically signaled that Arizona is challenging Texas's long reign as banking's busiest graveyard.
14/wsj_1442:Security Pacific Corp. said third-quarter credit losses surged a third to $109 million, mainly because of sour Arizona real-estate loans.
14/wsj_1442:Examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had been combing through First Interstate's real-estate portfolio since last month; they first recommended that First Interstate take a provision that was less than the eventual $350 million third-quarter hit.
14/wsj_1442:"At that point, {First Interstate} decided it was the better part of valor not to negotiate further," said one industry official close to the talks.
14/wsj_1442:Thomas P. Marrie, chief financial officer, wouldn't comment about the details of the negotiations.
14/wsj_1442:At least six of Arizona's 12 savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent; they are sitting on enormous unrecognized losses. 
14/wsj_1442:For example, Western Savings & Loan Association, which is now in conservatorship, had tangible capital-assets minus liabilities -- of a negative $357.4 million at June 30.
14/wsj_1442:Yet it still held $916.3 million of repossessed real estate, for which it maintains no reserves whatsoever.
14/wsj_1442:It also had $479.7 million of past-due loans; its level of reserves against those wasn't immediately available, though it is believed to be small. 
14/wsj_1442:The rapid deterioration of the Arizona thrifts only adds to the ever-swelling cost of the government's massive thrift bailout, officially estimated at about $166 billion.
14/wsj_1442:Together, the six government-controlled or essentially insolvent Arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $1.5 billion, foreclosed property of $1.8 billion and pastdue loans of $1.63 billion. 
14/wsj_1442:They have no reserves against the real estate, and their reserves against the loans are miniscule compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up.
14/wsj_1442:The thrifts had a combined loss of $487.8 million in the second quarter.
14/wsj_1442:All this havoc is the result of one of the worst busts in Arizona's boom-and-bust history, compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking debacles: greed, fraud and plain bad banking.
14/wsj_1442:In the late 1970s and early 1980s, lenders and developers poured money into office buildings, condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land, confident that Arizona's population would grow at annual rates of 4% to 6% for years to come.
14/wsj_1442:Now, annual population growth is running at about 2% a year, some desert tracts bought three years ago for $90,000 an acre are being sold at $25,000 an acre and Phoenix has a seven-year supply of unoccupied office space. 
14/wsj_1442:"It's horrible to say, but it's unfortunate that earthquake wasn't in Phoenix -- it might have knocked out some of our empty buildings," said C.W. Jackson, a prominent Arizona businessman with interests in real estate, banking and many other businesses. 
14/wsj_1442:Ralph Shattuck, publisher of Foreclosure Update newsletter, said foreclosures have climbed to about 1,482 a month just in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located.
14/wsj_1442:Moreover, Mr. Shattuck and others said residential real estate, which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn, is beginning to comprise more and more of the foreclosures.
14/wsj_1442:And the generally frail condition of Arizona's lenders means there is little capital available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide. 
14/wsj_1442:"It's reasonable to say there is not a solvent S&L in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low," said Mr. Jackson. "We're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end. . . . The only thing a lot of these lenders can get out of their mouth now is: `Pay me in 60 days. '" 
14/wsj_1442:For the six months ended June 30, it reported net income of $234.3 million, or $4.83 a share, including $46 million from tax credits and accounting changes. 
14/wsj_1442:The bank's Arizona unit holds about $6 billion of First Interstate's $50 billion of assets.
14/wsj_1442:First Interstate said its operations outside of Arizona "achieved results as expected for the quarter," but didn't specify the results. 
14/wsj_1442:Separately, Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on Valley National Corp. 's senior debt to double-B from double-B-plus, affecting about $300 million of long-term debt.
14/wsj_1442:S&P also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed by a letter of credit from the bank holding company's principal unit, Valley National Bank of Arizona.
14/wsj_1443:Immunex Corp. said its scientists isolated a molecule which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune-system, ranging from organ-transplant rejection, to allergies and asthma. 
14/wsj_1443:The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor.
14/wsj_1443:IL-4 is a hormone which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body's immune response.
14/wsj_1443:The IL-4 receptor on the surface of such cells receives the hormone's message to rally the body's defense. 
14/wsj_1443:A soluble form of the receptor might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune suppression, the company said. 
14/wsj_1443:The IL-4 receptor is one of five such receptors to be developed and tested by Receptech Corp., a spinoff of Immunex, through a proposed $30 million initial public offering.
14/wsj_1443:Immunex will contract with the spinoff to provide the research, development and initial testing of the new agents.
14/wsj_1444:Heller Financial Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Fuji Bank Ltd., shelf offering of up to $1 billion debt securities and warrants. 
14/wsj_1444:Jason Overseas Ltd., proposed offering of five million common shares, via Smith Barney & Co. and Mabon Nugent & Co. 
14/wsj_1444:MCI Communications Corp., shelf offering of up to $750 million of debt securities via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., and Salomon Brothers Inc. 
14/wsj_1444:Millicom Inc., offering of $60 million subordinated exchangeable debentures, via Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. 
14/wsj_1444:Union Tank Car Co., offering of $100 million of equipment trust certificates, via Salomon Brothers. 
14/wsj_1445:Its revenue totaled $184.4 million, an increase of 172% from $67.8 million a year ago. 
14/wsj_1445:Analysts expect Conner's earnings to reach roughly $40 million, or $1 to $1.05 a share, on sales of $650 million, for 1989, the company's third full year in business.
14/wsj_1445:But Compaq had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up. 
14/wsj_1445:Since its inception, Conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10 times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines. 
14/wsj_1445:Today, Conner controls an estimated 90% of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers.
14/wsj_1445:The company supplies drives to Compaq and Zenith Data Systems, the top two U.S. manufacturers of laptops, and to Toshiba Corp., NEC Corp. and Sharp Corp., the leading Japanese laptop makers. 
14/wsj_1445:Next month, Seagate Technology, which is the dominant supplier of hard-disk drives for personal computers, plans to introduce its first family of low-power drives for battery-operated computers. 
14/wsj_1445:Yesterday, the company introduced four products, three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks.
14/wsj_1445:Each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of power and one weighs just 5.5 ounces. 
14/wsj_1445:"Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our (older) products," said Finis Conner, chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name. "We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can." These new products could account for as much as 35% of the company's business in 1990, Mr. Conner estimated. "We're not afraid of obsoleting some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition," he said. 
14/wsj_1445:The availability of these drives, in turn, boosted demand for laptop computers, whose usefulness had been limited because of lack of storage. 
14/wsj_1445:Conner also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major supplier to Compaq, which as of July owned 40% of Conner's stock.
14/wsj_1445:Sales to Compaq represented 26% of Conner's business in its third quarter, compared with 42% in the year-ago period. 
14/wsj_1446:Telelawyer is apparently the only telephone service that offers the telephone equivalent of an office visit.
14/wsj_1446:Local bar associations in some states have numbers that provide free tape-recorded messages explaining certain areas of the law.
14/wsj_1446:When a caller reaches Telelawyer by dialing 900-TELELAW, a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys.
14/wsj_1446:In an effort to determine whether a caller has reason to sue, Cane lawyers review documents and perform research, if necessary, with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers.
14/wsj_1446:Out of the $2 charge, the law firm pockets about $1.55. 
14/wsj_1446:A federal court jury in New York found U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia (D., N.Y.) and his wife, Jane Lee Garcia, guilty of extorting $76,000 from Wedtech in return for official acts by the congressman.
14/wsj_1446:The jury also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a $20,000, interest-free loan from a Wedtech officer.
14/wsj_1446:The jury found them guilty of conspiracy in obtaining the payments, some of which were disguised as fees for consulting services from Mrs. Garcia. 
14/wsj_1446:Edward J.M. Little, one of the assistant U.S. attorneys who prosecuted the case, said the Garcia trial "is the last of the Wedtech prosecutions." Mr. Little said more than 20 people have been convicted in the Wedtech cases, including former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi (D., N.Y.). 
14/wsj_1446:"In the next few weeks, I will be consulting with my political advisers and with the Democratic leaders about the best way of preserving the interests of my constituents," said Mr. Garcia, 56 years old.
14/wsj_1446:Mrs. Garcia, 49, formerly was a member of Mr. Garcia's congressional staff. 
14/wsj_1446:The Garcias were cleared of four other felony counts, involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities. 
14/wsj_1446:They will be joined by Larry Gainen, who resigned from the firm of LePatner, Gainen & Block. 
14/wsj_1446:Howard Rubenstein, a New York publicist who represents Shea & Gould, said, "Shea & Gould understands they're leaving because they wanted a different environment -- a smaller firm they would be principals of." Mr. Rubenstein said the five, who weren't on Shea & Gould's management committee, "are leaving on good terms." 
14/wsj_1446:He said Shea & Gould held a number of discussions with the five partners during the past few weeks to get them to stay but that the five were firmly committed to running their own firm. 
14/wsj_1446:Non-lawyers will be added to the inquiry panels that look into allegations of misconduct. 
14/wsj_1446:One vocal critic of the changes, Chicago lawyer Warren Lupel, says non-lawyers shouldn't be on the inquiry panels because they are unlikely to appreciate the nuances of attorney-client relationships.
14/wsj_1446:In addition, he says, publishing the names of lawyers who are facing charges unnecessarily subjects them to public derogation. 
14/wsj_1446:DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc. agreed to pay a $50,000 fine to Delaware, the 26th state to settle with Drexel in the wake of the firm's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges.
14/wsj_1446:Drexel pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud; it also made a $650 million civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
14/wsj_1447:Executives close to Philip Morris said that the tobacco and food giant has asked Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc., a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi Co., and possibly others to work on creative ideas for the account.
14/wsj_1447:The loss of the cigarette account would be a severe blow to Wells Rich.
14/wsj_1447:Benson & Hedges has been one of its most high-visibility campaigns, as well as one of its largest clients.
14/wsj_1447:According to John Maxwell, an analyst at Wheat First Securities, Richmond, Va., Benson & Hedges has slipped from 4.7% of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1% after the second quarter of this year.
14/wsj_1447:Wells Rich Greene, however, in an effort directed by Mary Wells Lawrence, emerged the victor of the review and retained the business. 
14/wsj_1447:While Wells Rich recently picked up Hertz Corp. 's $25 million to $30 million account, it has lost a number of big accounts this year, including the $20 million to $25 million Cadbury-Schweppes Canada Dry and Sunkist accounts, the $18 million Procter & Gamble Co. Sure deodorant account and the $10 million Polo/Ralph Lauren business.
14/wsj_1448:This city is girding for gridlock today as hundreds of thousands of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged by last week's earthquake. 
14/wsj_1448:Estimates of damage in the six-county San Francisco Bay area neared $5 billion, excluding the cost of repairing the region's transportation system. 
14/wsj_1448:Part of the bridge collapsed in the quake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.
14/wsj_1448:Also, most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south, the 101 freeway, have been closed for repairs. 
14/wsj_1448:The Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which runs subway trains beneath the bay, is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to 300,000.
14/wsj_1448:Most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the East Bay towns of Oakland and Berkeley.
14/wsj_1448:The Red and White Fleet, which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from Marin County, and tourist tours of the bay, is offering East Bay commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $10 round-trip. 
14/wsj_1448:Officials expect the Golden Gate Bridge to be swamped with an extra load of commuters, including East Bay residents making a long detour. "We're anticipating quite a traffic crunch," said one official.
14/wsj_1448:Meetings canceled by Apple Computer Inc. 's European sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants.
14/wsj_1448:It also raised hackles of the city's tourism boosters. "Other cities are calling {groups booked here for tours and conferences} and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list," said Scott Shafer, a spokesman for Mayor Art Agnos. 
14/wsj_1448:City officials stuck by their estimate of $2 billion in damage to the quake-shocked city.
14/wsj_1448:Among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated freeway in San Francisco that were closed because of quake-inflicted damage. 
14/wsj_1448:The most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known as the Embarcadero Freeway.
14/wsj_1448:Until it was closed Tuesday, it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the Bay Bridge heading into the Financial District.
14/wsj_1448:As part of the quake recovery effort, the city Building Department has surveyed about 3,000 buildings, including all of the Financial District's high-rises. 
14/wsj_1448:The preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that "we were incredibly lucky," said Lawrence Kornfield, San Francisco's chief building inspector.
14/wsj_1448:While many of these buildings sustained heavy damage, little of that involved major structural damage.
14/wsj_1448:In England, Martin Leach, a spokesman for Lloyd's of London, said the insurance market hasn't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster. "The extent of the claims won't be known for some time," Mr. Leach said. 
14/wsj_1448:California officials plan to ask Congress for $3 billion or more of federal aid, in the form of grants and low-interest loans.
14/wsj_1448:Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid, but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief.
14/wsj_1448:However, state initiatives restrict the ability of the legislature to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum. 
14/wsj_1449:Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. posted a loss for fiscal 1989 of 980.2 million Australian dollars (US$762.4 million), the largest in Australian corporate history. 
14/wsj_1449:That loss compared with a year-earlier profit of A$273.5 million.
14/wsj_1449:In preliminary, unaudited results reported Friday, Bond Corp. also posted an operating loss of A$814.1 million for the year ended June 30, compared with operating profit of A$354.7 million a year earlier. 
14/wsj_1449:Much of Bond Corp. 's losses stemmed from one-time write-downs of the value of some of Bond Corp. 's assets and those of its units.
14/wsj_1449:The results included a A$453.4 million write-off of future income-tax benefits and a provision for a loss of A$149.5 million on the sale of a stake of about 20% in Lonrho PLC. However, Bond Corp. said the tax benefits remain available and might be used later. 
14/wsj_1449:The company said the general financial performance of its U.S. brewing operations, G. Heileman Brewing Co., was "disappointing, and this has been reflected in the results." 
14/wsj_1449:Bond Corp. 's shares closed Friday before news of the results at 28 Australian cents a share, up one Australian cent. 
14/wsj_1449:The staggering losses cap a tumultuous year for Alan Bond and his flagship, Bond Corp. Only a year ago, the chairman of Bond Corp., who controls about 58% of the company, appeared to be building a war chest to attack some big companies.
14/wsj_1449:It has sold billions of dollars of other assets and has more on the block. 
14/wsj_1449:It said it will look at opportunities in brewing, property and energy resources to the extent consistent with the dominant objective of manageable debt-to-assets ratios.
14/wsj_1449:Some analysts contend the total writeoffs should have been much greater, and Bond Corp. 's auditors cited a list of several assets and deals about which there is "uncertainty" regarding the current value and potential impact on the firm. 
14/wsj_1449:Bond Corp. said the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the tune of 53 Australian cents a share, vs. positive asset backing of A$1.92 a share a year ago.
14/wsj_1449:Still, the directors said, "Having fully considered all aspects of the company's state of affairs and future cash flows, the directors confirm absolutely that the company is solvent." 
14/wsj_1449:Indeed, in a note to the results, directors said if the "true worth" of some of the group's assets were taken into account instead of using book values, the negative net asset backing a share would turn into "a substantial positive" one. 
14/wsj_1450:The Bakersfield Supermarket went out of business last May.
14/wsj_1450:Nor was there a shortage of customers in the area, the residential Inwood section of northern Manhattan.
14/wsj_1450:The owner was Israel Ortiz, a 29-year-old entrepreneur and father of two.
14/wsj_1450:In his first year of operating the store he bought for $220,000, Mr. Ortiz was robbed at least twice at gunpoint.
14/wsj_1450:Israel Ortiz is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year.
14/wsj_1450:The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost 2% of all retail-sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year, almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers, truck drivers, medical workers and door-to-door salespeople.
14/wsj_1450:Only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury, such as police, bartenders and taxi drivers. 
14/wsj_1450:Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem.
14/wsj_1450:Recent data from New York City provide more of the picture.
14/wsj_1450:While by no means the highest crime community in the country, New York is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small-business development.
14/wsj_1450:A survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by Interface, a policy research organization.
14/wsj_1450:The survey found that over a three-year period 22% of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job.
14/wsj_1450:More than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises.
14/wsj_1450:In Brooklyn and the Bronx, one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year.
14/wsj_1450:Albert Reiss's landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn from national IRS records.
14/wsj_1450:He found that monetary crime losses, as a proportion of gross receipts, were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones. 
14/wsj_1450:The costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business. 
14/wsj_1450:Whatever the monetary crime losses, they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury.
14/wsj_1450:After repeated gun robberies, some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives.
14/wsj_1450:These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that National Institute of Justice Director James K. Stewart calls "crime causing poverty." Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities, contributing to the poverty of local residents.
14/wsj_1450:This may help explain why small businesses create 65% of all jobs nationally, but only 22% of jobs in a crime-ridden city like New York. 
14/wsj_1450:Bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime.
14/wsj_1450:The New York study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $1,000 per worker, compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees. 
14/wsj_1450:The shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments.
14/wsj_1450:Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places.
14/wsj_1450:Since 1984, in fact, revenues of the 10 largest guard companies, primarily serving such big businesses, have increased by almost 62%. 
14/wsj_1450:The number one proposal for reducing crime in the New York survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol, suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents.
14/wsj_1450:A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms, which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses.
14/wsj_1450:Another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas.
14/wsj_1450:Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such "hot spots" of pedestrian density.
14/wsj_1450:With National Institute of Justice support, the Minneapolis police and the Crime Control Institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy, comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols. 
14/wsj_1450:It might even have saved the life, and business, of Israel Ortiz. 
14/wsj_1450:Mr. Sherman is a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland and president of the Crime Control Institute in Washington, D.C. 
14/wsj_1452:Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, in a CNN "Capital Gang" discussion Oct. 7 of House action on federal catastrophic-illness insurance: 
14/wsj_1452:I think this repeal was kind of a thoughtless action, as a matter of fact. . . . They will have to revisit this issue, and they'll have to revisit it before long. 
14/wsj_1453:That's a fundamental lesson for investors, but its truth was demonstrated once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market's Friday-the-13th plunge. 
14/wsj_1453:But several other types of funds shielded investors from the worst of the market's slide.
14/wsj_1453:"More than ever, people should realize they should have a diversified portfolio," said Jeremy Duffield, a senior vice president of Vanguard Group. "That means stocks, bonds, money market instruments and real estate." 
14/wsj_1453:"You want to know how a fund did when the market got hammered," said Kurt Brouwer, an investment adviser with Brouwer & Janachowski in San Francisco. "It's like kicking the tires of a car . . . . What you want to know is when the road's rough, when there's snow and ice, how's this car going to perform?" 
14/wsj_1453:General equity funds fell an average of 2.35% in the week ended Thursday, compared with a 2.32% slide for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
14/wsj_1453:But Lipper Analytical's figures show that there were a number of ways investors could have cushioned themselves from the stock market's gyrations. 
14/wsj_1453:Gold-oriented funds, for instance, which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal, posted an average decline of 1.15%.
14/wsj_1453:Flexible portfolio funds, which allocate investments among stocks, bonds and money-market instruments and other investments, declined at about half the rate of stock funds -- an average drop of 1.27%, according to Lipper. 
14/wsj_1453:Global allocation funds take the asset-allocation concept one step further by investing at least 25% of their portfolios outside the U.S.
14/wsj_1453:This gives them the added benefits of international diversification -- including a foreign-exchange boost during periods, like the past week, when the dollar declines against other major currencies.
14/wsj_1453:But while the merits of diversification shine through when times are tough, there's also a price to pay: A diversified portfolio always underperforms an undiversified portfolio during those times when the investment in the undiversified portfolio is truly hot. 
14/wsj_1453:By comparison, global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about 19%, while domestic flexible portfolios are up about 17%.
14/wsj_1453:Among the big stock funds, Dreyfus Fund, with more than $2 billion in assets, had a decline of just 1.49% for the week and a return of 21.42% for the year.
14/wsj_1453:Howard Stein, chairman of Dreyfus Corp., said the fund was about half invested in government bonds on Oct. 13, and about 10% in cash. "In a downward market, bonds act better," he said. "We still think there's a lot of unsettlement in this market.
14/wsj_1453:Many of the funds that did best in the last week are heavily invested overseas, giving them the benefit of foreign currency translations when the dollar is weak.
14/wsj_1453:But when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies, as it did for much of this year, the dollar value of these funds declines.
14/wsj_1453:Of the funds that fared the worst in the post-Oct. 13 week, two are heavily invested in airlines stocks, which led the market slide following problems with financing for the UAL Corp. buy-out plan.
14/wsj_1453:The small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign, said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical.
14/wsj_1453:Noting that equity funds are up nearly 60% from their post-crash low on Dec. 3, 1987, he said that what happened last week "may not be enough of an adjustment.
14/wsj_1453:There's either more to come or an extremely long period of dullness." 
14/wsj_1454:Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance PLC, a major British composite insurer, said it is taking a stake in Nationwide Anglia Building Society's estate agency business as part of a plan to create a range of commercial linkages in the U.K. and Europe. 
14/wsj_1454:Officials declined to disclose the value of the transaction or the exact stake that GRE will hold in Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents.
14/wsj_1455:Sitting at the bar of the Four Seasons restaurant, architect William McDonough seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting.
14/wsj_1455:After years of relative obscurity, he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture. 
14/wsj_1455:Mr. McDonough believes that the well-being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution, tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues, and avoiding mahogany, which comes from endangered rain forests. 
14/wsj_1455:He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star Quilted Giraffe restaurant -- "architecturally impeccable," Progressive Architecture magazine called it -- and his remodeling of Paul Stuart, the Madison Avenue clothing store.
14/wsj_1455:Bloomingdale's plans to sell a foot-tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays.
14/wsj_1455:Some of the sales proceeds will go to the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS.
14/wsj_1455:A cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an AIDS benefit at Sotheby's in December. 
14/wsj_1455:If Mr. McDonough's plans get executed, as much of the Polish center as possible will be made from aluminum, steel and glass recycled from Warsaw's abundant rubble.
14/wsj_1455:A 20-story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space.
14/wsj_1455:To the extent that the $150 million budget will allow it, Mr. McDonough will rely on solid wood, rather than plywood or particle board, to limit the emission of formaldehyde. 
14/wsj_1455:If Mr. McDonough has his way, the Poles will compensate for the trade center's emissions of carbon dioxide, a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear.
14/wsj_1455:The Poles would plant a 10-square-mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $150,000, with the center's developer footing the bill. 
14/wsj_1455:All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work, says John Burgee, whose New York firm is designing the redevelopment of Times Square, "but we can't all carry it to that extreme." Karen Nichols, senior associate at Michael Graves's architecture firm in Princeton, N.J., says: "We're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily." 
14/wsj_1455:The son of a Seagram's executive who was stationed in many countries around the world, Mr. McDonough was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from Hong Kong to Shaker Heights, Ohio, before entering Dartmouth College.
14/wsj_1455:At Yale, he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in Ireland. 
14/wsj_1455:Mr. McDonough's first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York.
14/wsj_1455:The offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14-foot ceilings and big, operable windows. 
14/wsj_1455:To reduce it at the fund's building, workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director's office.
14/wsj_1455:Jute, rather than a synthetic material, lies under the tacked-down carpets, and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic. 
14/wsj_1455:The fund's lawyers work in an Athenian grove of potted trees.
14/wsj_1455:"We proved a healthy office doesn't cost more," says Frederic Krupp, executive director of the fund. 
14/wsj_1455:Neither the Quilted Giraffe nor the Paul Stuart renovation reflects much of Mr. McDonough's environmental concern.
14/wsj_1455:The restaurant was conceived as a sparkling, crystalline "geode." It makes extensive use of stainless steel, silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc-strip floors.
14/wsj_1455:The center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment, not readily accessible in Poland now, for a growing number of Westerners doing business in Eastern Europe. 
14/wsj_1455:Mr. McDonough thinks of the center as the "Eiffel Tower of Warsaw" and "a symbol of the resurgence of Poland." If any nation can use environmentally benign architecture, it is Poland.
14/wsj_1455:Jessica Mathews, vice president of World Resources Institute in Washington, D.C., says that perhaps a quarter of Poland's soil is too contaminated for safe farming because of air pollution.
14/wsj_1455:The future of the forest remains uncertain.
14/wsj_1456:Pittston Co. 's third-quarter net income plunged 79%, reflecting the impact of a prolonged and bitter labor strike at its coal operations. 
14/wsj_1456:While "the tone" of domestic and international air-freight markets remains sound, seasonal factors are likely to hinder Burlington Air from matching third-quarter results in the fourth quarter, Pittston said. 
14/wsj_1457:Mr. Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, can afford more bumbling and stumbling because he holds a comfortable 20-point lead in most of the public-opinion polls.
14/wsj_1457:But, in the past 10 days, he has taken a series of body blows to his pride and his reputation that could adversely affect his ability to govern this tumultuous city should he become New York's first black mayor. 
14/wsj_1457:And now, at the crucial moment, he's running out of money. 
14/wsj_1457:Republicans figured that in Mr. Giuliani, the nation's best-known prosecutor, they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of Democratic territory and that they would pick up a new political star. 
14/wsj_1457:To help out this week, the White House is dispatching chief of staff John Sununu and three Cabinet members -- HUD's Jack Kemp, Transportation's Samuel Skinner and Treasury's Nicholas Brady, according to Peter Powers, the Giuliani campaign manager. 
14/wsj_1457:For Republicans who began this campaign with such high hopes, all of this is deeply frustrating.
14/wsj_1457:"People weren't so happy in the 1930s," says Thomas Lessner, another local professor and the biographer of the legendary Fiorello LaGuardia, the city's fusion mayor who built a coalition Mr. Giuliani hopes to emulate. "But, at least, back then they didn't generally direct their anger at each other." 
14/wsj_1457:The 62-year-old Mr. Dinkins, an ex-Marine, has served as the city clerk and as Manhattan borough president, a job with limited executive responsibilities ("I defy you to come up with one major accomplishment of David Dinkins," says Mr. Giuliani.) 
14/wsj_1457:The 45-year-old Mr. Giuliani has run a negative campaign to pick up votes leaning to Mr. Dinkins. "He's got to get Dinkins's negatives up," says Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute of Public Opinion. "But our polls show voters don't like the attack stuff.
14/wsj_1457:Why, even 20% of the Republican vote is going to Dinkins." 
14/wsj_1457:On the other, he seeks to convince voters he's the new Fiorello LaGuardia -- affable, good-natured and ready to lead New York out of the mess it's in. 
14/wsj_1457:It hasn't helped that he's waffled on abortion and gay rights, sought the support of both the Liberal and Conservative parties (he won the Liberal endorsement) and that he turned to comedian Jackie Mason for help with Jewish voters.
14/wsj_1457:He can match Jackie Mason with his own Robert "Sonny" Carson, an angry street organizer who was convicted of kidnapping in 1974.
14/wsj_1457:He says he sold the stock to avoid conflict-of-interest problems in his role as a voting member of the city's Board of Estimate.
14/wsj_1457:"He simply hasn't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $58,000 two years later," says Mr. Powers, the Giuliani campaign manager. "It's ludicrous for him to suggest it's the difference between the 'breakup' value of the shares and their market value." 
14/wsj_1457:He's had a history of deception and this is the latest chapter." 
14/wsj_1458:The long-running scandal surrounding the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano was reignited by the arrest last week of Rome businessman Flavio Carboni on fraud charges. 
14/wsj_1458:Rome magistrates accuse Mr. Carboni and several other people of trying to extort 1.2 billion lire ($880,000) from the Vatican in return for documents contained in the briefcase of Roberto Calvi, the Ambrosiano chairman found hanged under London's Blackfriar's Bridge shortly before the bank's collapse. 
14/wsj_1458:Banco Ambrosiano, which was Italy's largest private-sector bank, collapsed in 1982 with $1.3 billion of debts.
14/wsj_1458:Most of the money was lent to a series of shell companies in Panama and Luxembourg that were owned, directly or indirectly, by the Vatican bank.
14/wsj_1459:The company also named Michael E. Gellert, a director and a major shareholder, to fill the vacant seat of chairman. 
14/wsj_1460:The investigation, which will be coordinated with one already under way in the U.S., follows the discovery of what Ferranti has called a "serious" fraud involving its U.S. subsidiary. 
14/wsj_1460:The Serious Fraud Office, a division of London's Metropolitan Police responsible for investigating financial crimes, said its work would take in "allegations of fraud prior to, surrounding and subsequent to the merger." 
14/wsj_1460:The British defense electronics group has said it will sell #100 million in assets and may seek a merger to strengthen itself in the wake of its troubles. 
14/wsj_1461:On Saturday, the partners said the team would be purchased for $54 million by a new group including Comsat Video Enterprises Inc., a unit of Communications Satellite Corp. based here.
14/wsj_1461:Under terms of the sale, Nuggets owner Sidney Shlenker could receive up to $11 million in additional payments from the franchise's future earnings. 
14/wsj_1461:Lee and Bynoe last July announced a deal that would have made them the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise.
14/wsj_1461:But the deal fell apart last week for lack of financing. 
14/wsj_1462:Royal withdrew its offer to buy Realist, a maker of optical and electronic products based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., for $14.06 a share in July after Realist disclosed the Ammann purchase.
14/wsj_1462:The suit seeks "in excess of $350,000 in damages." 
14/wsj_1463:The Forest City, Iowa, maker of motor homes said it had a loss of $11.3 million, or 46 cents a share, in the quarter ended Aug. 26.
14/wsj_1463:A year earlier, the company had a deficit of $1.5 million, or six cents a share. 
14/wsj_1463:With the exception of van conversions, the industry has seen a decline from 1988's robust sales.
14/wsj_1463:But the rate of the decline snowballed in August, with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5% from a year earlier, according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association. 
14/wsj_1463:"It's a large-ticket discretionary purchase," said Robert Curran, who follows the industry for Merrill Lynch & Co. "So when there's talk and concern about the economy, it's not unreasonable for a portion of the buying public to defer purchases." 
14/wsj_1463:Mr. Curran expects industry RV sales for all of 1989 to fall about 5% from 1988, when sales of 427,300 units were the highest since 1978.
14/wsj_1463:And he said the weakness could continue in the first half of next year.
14/wsj_1463:Winnebago was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled 25% industrywide in August, and 10.4% in the first eight months of the year.
14/wsj_1463:The company said it also suffered in the quarter from incentive programs, losses from discontinuing a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial vehicle, among other things. 
14/wsj_1463:Based on his control of about 45% of Winnebago's 24.7 million shares, his annual dividend income would be cut to about $2.2 million from $4.4 million. 
14/wsj_1463:For the year, Winnebago had a loss of $4.7 million, or 19 cents a share, following profit of $2.7 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier.
14/wsj_1464:As the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports, the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative.
14/wsj_1464:"Recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity," said Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities.
14/wsj_1464:Mr. Platt is advising clients that "the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward." 
14/wsj_1464:That would be comforting to fixed-income investors, many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the Fed would ease.
14/wsj_1464:For example, a group of long-term Treasury bonds tracked by Merrill Lynch & Co. produced a total return of 1% in the first quarter, 12.45% in the second quarter and -0.06% in the third quarter.
14/wsj_1464:Add it all up and it means "that the Fed has a little leeway to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh. "I think we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 1/2% in the next two weeks and 8% by year end." 
14/wsj_1464:The federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans, is considered an early signal of changes in the Fed's credit policy.
14/wsj_1464:Economists generally agree that the rate was lowered by the Fed from around 9%, where it had been since July, to about 8 3/4% in early October on the heels of a weak employment report.
14/wsj_1464:TVA, in its first public debt offering in 15 years, sold $4 billion of long-term and intermediate-term securities last week.
14/wsj_1464:Strong investor demand prompted the utility to boost the size of the issue from $3 billion.
14/wsj_1464:TVA, which operates one of the nation's largest electric power systems, is a corporation owned by the federal government. 
14/wsj_1464:But persuading investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week, when the U.S. government will auction more than $30 billion of new securities.
14/wsj_1464:Today, the Treasury Department will sell $15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills at the regular weekly auction.
14/wsj_1464:Tomorrow, the Treasury will sell $10 billion of two-year notes. 
14/wsj_1464:Resolution Funding Corp., known as Refcorp, a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation's troubled savings and loan associations, will hold its first bond auction Wednesday, when it will sell $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds.
14/wsj_1464:All of this comes ahead of the government's big quarterly refunding of the federal debt, which takes place sometime in November. 
14/wsj_1464:He seems to be typical of many professional money managers.
14/wsj_1464:When the size of the Refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began, the bailout bonds were yielding about 1/20 percentage point more than the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond.
14/wsj_1464:On Friday, the yield was quoted at about 1/4 percentage point higher than the benchmark bond, an indication of weak demand. 
14/wsj_1464:Also providing support to Treasurys was hope that the stock market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock-index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks.
14/wsj_1464:Treasury bonds ended with losses of as much as 1/4 point, or about $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.
14/wsj_1464:Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said that a $150 million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by R.P. Scherer Drugs is expected by the end of the month. 
14/wsj_1464:"There are about a dozen more deals coming," said Michael McNamara, director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services Inc. "If they had this much trouble with Chicago & North Western, they are going to have an awful time with the rest." 
14/wsj_1464:Last week, underwriters were forced to postpone three junk bond deals because of recent weakness in the market. 
14/wsj_1464:After hours of negotiating that stretched late into Thursday night, underwriters priced the 12-year issue of resettable senior subordinated debentures at par to yield 14.75%, higher than the 14.5% that had been expected.
14/wsj_1464:The coupon on the issue will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101.
14/wsj_1464:Debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10% of the common stock in Chicago & North Western's parent company. 
14/wsj_1464:"The coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to come in," said a spokesman for Donaldson. "We put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done." 
14/wsj_1465:The New York arm of the London-based auction house auctioned off the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr., the Campbell's Soup Co. heir, for $131 million last week, a record for a single-owner art collection. 
14/wsj_1465:Sotheby's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $100 million, and as much as $120 million, to obtain the collection, people familiar with the transaction said, thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold. 
14/wsj_1465:The Dorrance estate, auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days, included porcelains, furniture and paintings.
14/wsj_1465:In addition, a handful of paintings from the Dorrance collection remain to be sold at Sotheby's annual old masters paintings auction in January. 
14/wsj_1466:The Better Business Bureau of San Diego and the state Attorney General's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau-sponsored business directories published by an outside firm, Better Book Inc. 
14/wsj_1466:The uproar led to the closing of the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau in late 1987. 
14/wsj_1467:McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it obtained "firm" financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its offer for 50.3% of LIN Broadcasting Corp. Morgan Guaranty Trust, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Provident National Bank, an affiliate of PNC Financial Corp., jointly committed $1.2 billion of financing, subject to certain conditions, McCaw said. 
14/wsj_1467:Further, McCaw said the banks expressed confidence that the balance of the $4.5 billion bank facility will be committed within the next several weeks by a syndicate of foreign and domestic banks.
14/wsj_1467:McCaw is offering to buy 22 million shares of LIN for $125 each in cash, which would result in McCaw owning 50.3% of the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern.
14/wsj_1467:It quoted Liu Changyi, deputy director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, as saying that there were many more people involved in prostitution now than in 1985, when there were about 100 cases. 
14/wsj_1467:Japan agreed to enforce a decision by an international wildlife conference to ban all trade in ivory, a spokesman for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.
14/wsj_1467:The Japanese use 40% of the world's ivory. 
14/wsj_1467:Italy should close the Leaning Tower of Pisa because it's a danger to tourists, government-appointed experts said. "In some places the stonework is so damaged it shows signs of breaking off," scientists and technicians said in a report to Public Works Minister Giovanni Prandini.
14/wsj_1467:Each year, nearly a million people pay about $3 to make the spiral climb up 294 steps to the top of the 800-year-old marble tower. 
14/wsj_1467:East Germany pledged to reduce alcohol consumption by boosting production of soft drinks and fruit juices.
14/wsj_1467:Trade and Supply Minister Gerhard Briksa said in a letter published in the youth daily Junge Welt that the rise in alcohol consumption in East Germany had been halted; but to reduce it further, he said, production and supply of other beverages, including fruit juices, should be stepped up.
14/wsj_1467:He added that shops will have to continue reducing their stocks of liquor and avoid displaying them too prominently in the window. 
14/wsj_1467:The dispute started when China, angry that Hong Kong had allowed dissident swimmer Yang Yang to flee to the U.S., halted the usual daily transfer of illegal immigrants caught in this British colony, which reverts to Beijing's control in 1997. 
14/wsj_1467:Sweating under the glare of newly installed television lights, British members of Parliament demanded a halt to the experimental televising of debates.
14/wsj_1467:A group of senior Conservative legislators, complaining the House of Commons was like a sauna, demanded that the experiment be stopped unless the intensity of the lights is reduced.
14/wsj_1467:A majority of Japanese banks are said to be wary of making new loans to Mexico under the Brady plan because they're uncertain the Mexican economy will remain stable. 
14/wsj_1467:Instead, many small and medium-sized banks, and some larger ones, are likely to take one of the other two options open to them under the plan, Japanese banking officials said.
14/wsj_1467:The plan, proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Nicholas Brady, calls for banks either to make new loans or to reduce the principle on existing loans or to cut the interest rate on those existing loans. 
14/wsj_1467:The officials said that most Japanese banks prefer the losses they'd suffer in either of the latter options to the risk of new lending.
14/wsj_1467:A poll in male-dominated South Korea put Margaret Thatcher first on a list of most-respected foreign leaders.
14/wsj_1468:Robert Stein, president and chief executive officer, attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two-week strike last month at the company's Masillon, Ohio, bakeware facility.
14/wsj_1468:That would require fourth-quarter net of more than about 22 cents to 24 cents a share, assuming that Mr. Stein's third-quarter estimate proves accurate.
14/wsj_1468:In the year-earlier fourth quarter, the company had profit of $2.7 million, or 15 cents a share. 
14/wsj_1468:The year-earlier periods don't reflect results of the company's Woodstream Corp. unit, acquired last January, but include some Canadian operations that were sold at the end of 1988. 
14/wsj_1468:Mr. Stein said he expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989, reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of Ekco Housewares in late 1987. (Prior to acquiring the housewares business, the company was known as Centronics Corp.; Centronics had been a maker of computer printers, but Mr. Stein and other officers decided to sell that business after Japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market.) 
14/wsj_1468:Mr. Stein said tighter operating controls have enabled Ekco to reduce inventory levels 25% to 30%; improve on-time delivery of orders to about 95% from around 70%; and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit.
14/wsj_1468:By moving the design of new products in-house -- instead of contracting out the work -- the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently, he said. 
14/wsj_1468:In addition to those measures, the company spent heavily earlier this year to install displays at its customers' retail outlets -- a strategy that Mr. Stein said has helped bolster awareness of the company's brands. 
14/wsj_1468:He indicated that Ekco may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of $75 million to $100 million, partly because mass merchandisers increasingly want to rely on larger, and fewer, suppliers. 
14/wsj_1469:After several years of booming business with China, foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade. 
14/wsj_1469:The imposition of austerity measures, starting last October, already had begun to pinch when the massacre in Tiananmen Square on June 4 and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter.
14/wsj_1469:Last year's retrenchment dried up the working capital of Chinese factories.
14/wsj_1469:The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of China's austerity measures, and foreign companies such as Givaudan that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest.
14/wsj_1469:"The import pie will shrink," says John Kamm, first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist. "On the down side, sales could fall as much as 90% for some companies; on the upper side, sales will be flat." China's foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade.
14/wsj_1469:In addition, the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback. 
14/wsj_1469:Import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16% in July and 7.1% in August, compared with an average growth rate of 26% in the first half.
14/wsj_1469:In the first eight months of 1989, imports grew 21%, to $38.32 billion, down slightly from a growth rate of 23% a year earlier. 
14/wsj_1469:The picture for China's exports is just as bleak, mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze.
14/wsj_1469:Exports in the first eight months grew only 9%, to $31.48 billion, compared with a growth rate of 25% a year earlier, according to Chinese customs figures. 
14/wsj_1469:The threat to China's balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves, excluding gold holdings.
14/wsj_1469:In recent weeks, China's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities.
14/wsj_1469:The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses. 
14/wsj_1469:For example, Nissho Iwai Corp., one of the biggest Japanese trading houses, now buys almost twice as many goods from China as it sells to that country.
14/wsj_1469:But the strategy isn't helping much this time. "Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad," says Masahiko Kitamura, general manager of Nissho Iwai's Canton office.
14/wsj_1469:Even the Bank of China, which normally took weeks to process letters of credit, was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about the bank's financial health. 
14/wsj_1469:But when foreign traders tried to do business, they discovered that the eagerness of Chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen.
14/wsj_1469:The suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of China's national trading companies, which are among the country's biggest importers. 
14/wsj_1469:Foreign traders also say many of China's big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit.
14/wsj_1469:Albert Lee, a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales, estimates that as many as 70% of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months. "There are virtually no new projects, and that means no new business for us," he says. 
14/wsj_1469:Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that Beijing has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel, chemical fertilizers and plastics.
14/wsj_1469:Mr. Kamm, the China trade expert, estimates that as much as 50% of Guangdong's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials. 
14/wsj_1470:AN UNRESOLVED two-year-old dispute stemming from an Alaskan oil spill has helped spur a drive for tougher federal laws to protect victims of such accidents. 
14/wsj_1470:The class-action suit highlights shortcomings of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund, which gets its money from oil companies using the pipeline and compensates those harmed by oil spills. 
14/wsj_1470:On July 2, 1987, the tanker S.S. Glacier Bay struck a rock and spilled almost 150,000 gallons of oil into the Cook Inlet.
14/wsj_1470:The fund was created by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act, which provides that the owner or operator of a vessel involved in an oil spill must pay the first $14 million in damages.
14/wsj_1470:The Oil Pollution Act, scheduled to come up for a vote in Congress this fall, would provide that if claimants aren't paid within 90 days of a spill, the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel, says a spokesman for Rep. George Miller (D., Calif.), a sponsor of the bill.
14/wsj_1470:The spokesman says the "glitch" in the statute is "the worst kind of Catch-22." 
14/wsj_1470:Bar associations and consultants are offering more programs to teach associates all they need to know about law but didn't learn in law school. "Law school teaches wonderful theory, but it doesn't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering," says Aaron Weitz, head of a New York County Lawyers' Association committee that sponsors such a course. 
14/wsj_1470:But these days, large firms hire as many as 30 new associates a year, and it's impossible to personally train everyone, says Joel Henning of Hildebrandt Inc., a consulting firm that runs training classes. 
14/wsj_1470:At the Baltimore firm of Weinberg & Green, new corporate and banking associates are required to enroll in a 20-class course.
14/wsj_1470:THE CHILDREN of Los Angeles will soon have their own $52 million courthouse. 
14/wsj_1470:The building, which will handle child abuse, custody and foster care cases, will be "less formal, less threatening and just basically less grim than most courthouses," says Edmund Edelman, chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
14/wsj_1470:About 45,000 children in Los Angeles County are under court supervision, Mr. Edelman says, and an average of 1,500 new children are added each month. 
14/wsj_1470:The courthouse, to be built in Monterey Park, is expected to open in the spring of 1992. 
14/wsj_1470:That's the conclusion of a recent study of large law firms conducted by Altman & Weil Inc., an Ardmore, Pa., law firm consultant.
14/wsj_1470:Its survey of 96 firms, each with 100 to 1,000 lawyers, shows that managing partners earned an average of $395,974 in compensation and cash benefits in the firms' 1988 fiscal years. 
14/wsj_1470:Managing partners who responded to the survey typically spend over half their time supervising their firms' day-to-day operations and just a little more than a third of their time practicing law. 
14/wsj_1470:Partners in the survey who devote most of their time to practicing law earned an average of about $217,000. 
14/wsj_1471:Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.) of the House Appropriations Committee proposed a $2.85 billion emergency funding package to assist California's recovery from last week's earthquake and extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo. 
14/wsj_1471:The funds would be attached to a stop-gap spending bill required to keep most of the government operating past Wednesday. 
14/wsj_1471:The panel is expected to add provisions waiving restrictions on the use of federal highway funds and may also shift money within the package to bolster the share for the Small Business Administration. "We will support it, we will thank him, and we will augment it where appropriate," said Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.). 
14/wsj_1471:Dubbed the "Dire Emergency Supplemental to Meet the Needs of Natural Disasters of National Significance," the measure is vintage Whitten in asserting federal responsibility and in disdaining budget impediments. "Such other amounts will be made available subsequently as required," the legislation reads, and the new obligations "shall not be a charge against the Budget Act, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, or other ceilings." 
14/wsj_1472:Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $145 million of Pinnacle debt because of "accelerating deficiency in liquidity," which it said was evidenced by Pinnacle's elimination of dividend payments.
14/wsj_1472:We aren't selling bonds right now, and I don't think it will affect the value of our existing bonds." The rating agency said it lowered the ratings on $75 million of the holding company's convertible subordinated Eurodebentures to B-3 from B-1.
14/wsj_1472:Moody's said it also lowered the ratings of $70 million of Pinnacle's MeraBank thrift unit long-term deposits to B-3 from B-2, and on its subordinated debt to Ca from Caa.
14/wsj_1472:Securities of MeraBank were placed under review last May, and will remain under review for downgrade, the agency said. 
14/wsj_1473:First, the somewhat affected idealism of the 1960s.
14/wsj_1473:Then, the all-too-sincere opportunism of the 1970s and 1980s.
14/wsj_1473:To judge from novels that mirror the contemporary scene, we're back in the age of anxiety.
14/wsj_1473:Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success, it now seems that so many people feel they're slipping between the cracks, that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing. 
14/wsj_1473:Lisa Zeidner's third novel, "Limited Partnerships" (North Point Press, 256 pages, $18.95) is a stylish, funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money, or, more specifically, the lack of it.
14/wsj_1473:Malcolm, a former film-maker turned architect, has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady, obnoxious client, a fly-by-night real estate developer.
14/wsj_1473:Nora, who still has artistic aspirations, knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist, prepping pies, burgers, frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera.
14/wsj_1473:They seem to be having the "worst of both worlds: artistic work with none of art's integrity and no control over the finished product; self-employment without fun or profit." 
14/wsj_1473:It's a downbeat, "thirtysomething" world, in which bright, still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor, doing free-lance, semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do.
14/wsj_1473:Uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives.
14/wsj_1473:While she is wondering whether to live it up, and do something even more dramatic, say get married, her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame, David, a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom. 
14/wsj_1473:In novels of an earlier vintage, David would have represented excitement and danger; Malcolm, placid, middle-class security.
14/wsj_1473:The characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a "middle way" between the extremes of success and failure, wealth and poverty. 
14/wsj_1473:In making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation, Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters.
14/wsj_1473:The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts (even the characters' own) are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters.
14/wsj_1473:But readers may well feel the pangs of recognition. 
14/wsj_1473:In any case, the foundering middle classes aren't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction. "Rascal Money" (Contemporary Books, 412 pages, $17.95), a novel by consultant and business analyst Joseph R. Garber, tells the story of an innovative, well-run, widely respected computer manufacturing company called PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW, a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world. 
14/wsj_1473:Patrician, dynamic Scott Thatcher, founder and head of PegaSys, initially finds the takeover threat risible.
14/wsj_1473:But, as he and his skilled team soon discover, they're up against two factors they hadn't counted on: first, a business climate in which a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover; second, that standing behind AIW is a sinister consortium of much bigger, shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal. 
14/wsj_1473:Mr. Garber manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast-paced action of a suspense novel.
14/wsj_1473:And like a spy or mystery story, this novel has strong elements of allegory, as the good and evil forces battle it out.
14/wsj_1473:Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures.
14/wsj_1473:Standard-issue portraits of flaky Californians, snobbish homosexuals and Neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author's perceptions.
14/wsj_1473:Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this: If the head of AIW were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible, malicious dolt, we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated, and would not be so diverted in the process. 
14/wsj_1474:High-definition television promises to be the TV of tomorrow, so it is a natural multibillion-dollar market.
14/wsj_1474:Although major U.S. manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to Japan, not everyone here is ready to give up. 
14/wsj_1474:A handful of small U.S. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin, high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s.
14/wsj_1474:With only small help from the government, these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry, which enjoy considerable backing from the Japanese government. 
14/wsj_1474:Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood, Ohio, aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick. 
14/wsj_1474:Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., the largest of these firms, with $20 million in annual revenue, has similar plans.
14/wsj_1474:Two other firms, Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc. of Troy, Mich., and Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh are developing a variation of the flat-panel screens called active-matrix liquid crystal displays. 
14/wsj_1474:The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube, which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set.
14/wsj_1474:Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large, thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television, or HDTV, which is expected to become a $30 billion business world-wide within a decade.
14/wsj_1474:Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business, such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment.
14/wsj_1474:General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France. "We found the market not developing as we thought it would," a GE spokesman says. 
14/wsj_1474:The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents, and because the prize is still there to be seized. "No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels" at commercial costs, says Zvi Yaniv, the president of Ovonic Imaging.
14/wsj_1474:Thus far, almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories.
14/wsj_1474:The panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements, each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image. 
14/wsj_1474:He has a claim to the right to commercialize the Westinghouse patents, but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of Japanese producers. 
14/wsj_1474:Many critics question the industry's need for federal support; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds. "We don't see a domestic source for some of our {HDTV} requirements, and that's a source of concern," says Michael Kelly, director of DARPA's defense manufacturing office.
14/wsj_1474:The Commerce Department also is trying to encourage HDTV because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries. "It isn't just yuppie television," argues Jack Clifford, director of the department's office of microelectronics and instrumentation. "The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market." 
14/wsj_1474:Although some HDTV advocates are calling for other forms of aid, such as antitrust relief for research consortia, the small firms simply would prefer more DARPA funds.
14/wsj_1475:The holding of 13.6 million shares is up from a 6.7% stake that Burmah announced SHV held as of last Monday. 
14/wsj_1475:SHV, of the Netherlands, which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC and which owns 40% of Calor, was identified as a possible suitor for Burmah. 
14/wsj_1475:Burmah said it hadn't held any discussions with SHV and that "no deal of any nature is in contemplation." 
14/wsj_1476:Critics of the plan, including the town of Braintree, say the incinerator is a health hazard. 
14/wsj_1476:Alan McKim, chief executive officer of Clean Harbors said he was "very much encouraged" by the official's praise of Clean Harbors for the quality of some of the data in the report. 
14/wsj_1477:Terms of the bank holding companies' agreement weren't disclosed. 
14/wsj_1477:Factoring involves the purchase and collection of another company's receivables.
14/wsj_1478:The Office of Thrift Supervision banned B.J. Garman, a former director of the failed Vision Banc Savings Association of Kingsville, Texas, from working in any financial institution insured by the government. 
14/wsj_1478:The office, a Treasury Department unit that is the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said this was the first announcement of an enforcement action since this year's thrift-bailout legislation ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made public. 
14/wsj_1478:Vision Banc was placed in government conservatorship in March, and it operates under the control of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts. 
14/wsj_1478:However, it said examiners found a variety of insider dealings at the thrift, including "extraordinary loan commissions" paid to a firm associated with Vision Banc officials, and loans diverted through borrowers back to the thrift officials. 
14/wsj_1479:Arizona Instrument Corp. said it expects to post a third-quarter net loss of about $600,000, or 25 cents to 27 cents a share, compared with net income of $214,000, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. 
14/wsj_1479:The Tempe, Ariz., maker of underground fuel-storage systems said the most recent period was affected by customers' problems complying with recent Environmental Protection Agency regulations. 
14/wsj_1479:For the nine months, the company expects to post a net loss of about $879,000, or 35 cents to 40 cents a share, on revenue of $6.5 million.
14/wsj_1479:A year earlier, it had a loss of $199,203 or nine cents a share, on revenue of $7.6 million. 
14/wsj_1480:At least, that's a theme emerging among many money managers who are anxious both to preserve the handsome stock-market gains they have already achieved this year and to catch the next wave of above-average performers.
14/wsj_1480:The upper echelon of this group were shares of the "nifty 50" companies whose profits of the 1960s and early 1970s grew steadily, if not spectacularly, through thick and thin.
14/wsj_1480:That sort of workhorse performance sounds made to order for a time when corporate profits overall have been weakening from the brisk increases of recent years.
14/wsj_1480:The current flood of third-quarter reports are producing many more negative surprises than positive ones. 
14/wsj_1480:That's the path of reasoning leading to growth stocks. 
14/wsj_1480:Growth stocks may be as big as Philip Morris or medium-sized such as Circuit City Stores, but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of at least 15% to 20% a year, money managers say. 
14/wsj_1480:"The period when growth stocks should be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate profits," says Stephen Boesel, president of T. Rowe Price's Growth and Income Fund. 
14/wsj_1480:Growth stocks also are attractive in periods of market volatility, which many investors and analysts expect in the weeks ahead as everybody tries to discern where the economy is heading.
14/wsj_1480:This kind of jumpy uncertainty reminds John Calverley, senior economist for American Express Bank, of the 1969-72 period, when the industrial average rolled through huge ranges and investors flocked to the shares of companies with proven earnings records, which became known as the "nifty 50." 
14/wsj_1480:And they will again, say money-manager proponents of the growth-stock theme.
14/wsj_1480:Cabanne Smith, president of a money management company bearing his name, predicts that investment companies using computers to identify companies with earnings "momentum" will climb on the growth-stock bandwagon as the overall corporate earnings outlook deteriorates further.
14/wsj_1480:He also thinks foreign investors, who are showing signs of more discriminate investing, will join the pursuit and pump up prices. 
14/wsj_1480:"We're just seeing the beginning of a shift," Mr. Smith says.
14/wsj_1480:Ronald Sloan, executive vice president of Siebel Capital Management, likes Wellman Inc., a company that recycles plastic into synthetic fibers for carpeting.
14/wsj_1480:Mr. Sloan praises the company as recession resistant and notes that it has an annual earnings growth rate of 32% a year over the past five years.
14/wsj_1480:Others preach the gospel of buying only blue-chip growth stocks.
14/wsj_1480:All have a fiveyear earnings growth rate of more than 20% a year. 
14/wsj_1480:Some money managers are pursuing growth stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along with the economic cycle. "One of the stories of the fourth quarter is that we will get an unusual number of earnings disappointments from companies sensitive to the economy," says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price. 
14/wsj_1480:James Wright, chief investment officer for Banc One Asset Management, says, "We've been selling a disproportionate share of cyclical companies and buying a disproportionate share of high earnings stocks." He recently trimmed his portfolio of International Paper, Dow Chemical, Quantum Chemical, International Business Machines and Digital Equipment.
14/wsj_1480:He cites IBM, which reported a 30% earnings decline in the third quarter, and which last week announced a $1 billion buy-back of its shares. 
14/wsj_1480:"What they are telling you is that they don't have the ability to generate higher returns internally," says Mr. Sloan. "When they are buying back stock at 10 times earnings, they are suggesting that the rate of return on competing internal projects is below" returns on the stock.
14/wsj_1480:Traders anticipated a volatile session due to the October expiration of stock-index futures and options, and options on individual stocks.
14/wsj_1480:As a result, the Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted in narrow ranges in the final hour of trading, and closed 5.94 higher to 2689.14.
14/wsj_1480:Most of last week's surge in the industrial average came on Monday, when the average rose 88.12 points as market players snapped up blue-chip issues and shunned the broad market. 
14/wsj_1480:USA Today reported that Mr. Davis, who had pursued UAL before dropping his bid Wednesday, has acquired a stake of about 3% in USAir.
14/wsj_1480:Paper and forest-products stocks declined after Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. lowered investment ratings on a number of issues in the two sectors, based on a forecast that pulp prices will fall sharply.

14/wsj_1481:Stoneridge Resources Inc. said it will begin an offering of rights equivalent to 2.6 million common shares and valued at $22,750,000. 
14/wsj_1481:The Bloomfield Hills, Mich.-based real-estate holding company said it will offer the rights at $8.75 a share to shareholders of record on Oct. 26.
14/wsj_1481:The company said it will use the proceeds of the offering for debt reduction and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. 
14/wsj_1481:Stockholders may buy one share at the subscription price for every four shares of stock they own.

14/wsj_1483:MCI COMMUNICATIONS Corp. said it filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for issuance of as much as $750 million of debt securities.
14/wsj_1483:The funds will be used for refinancing existing debt of the Washington, D.C., concern at lower interest rates and for other general purposes.
14/wsj_1483:The effective date of the registration is to be determined by the SEC. 
14/wsj_1484:A group including ESL Partners Ltd., a Fort Worth, Texas, investment partnership, and Richard E. Rainwater, a former adviser to the Fort Worth Bass family, said it reduced its stake in Anacomp Inc. to 3.6% of the common shares outstanding. 
14/wsj_1485:The life-insurance holding company said the sale would result in an after-tax gain of about $32 million, or $3.09 a share, in the first quarter of 
14/wsj_1485:The change will result in a charge of about $8.5 million, or 82 cents a share, because of an increase in deferred income-tax liability. 
14/wsj_1485:In the first quarter of 1988, the company earned $10 million, or 94 cents a share.

14/wsj_1487:A shareholder filed suit, seeking to block Unitel Video Inc. 's proposed plan to be acquired by a new affiliate of closely held Kenmare Capital Corp. for $15 a share, or $33.6 million. 
14/wsj_1487:The complaint alleges that the price is "unfair and grossly inadequate" and that the defendants are seeking to ensure a "lockup" of the purchase of Unitel, thereby discouraging other bids.
14/wsj_1488:The new dividend rate is payable Nov. 15 to holders of record Oct. 31.
14/wsj_1489:Comair Holdings is the parent of Comair Inc., a regional air carrier. 
14/wsj_1489:Airline Aviation, which has annual revenue of $5 million to $6 million, has great growth potential because of the large number of U.S. pilots nearing retirement age, Comair said.
14/wsj_1489:The unit will be renamed Comair Aviation Academy and will continue to be headed by Scott Williams, a son of its founder, Comair said. 
14/wsj_1490:The collapse of a $6.79 billion buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has handed Wall Street's takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal. 
14/wsj_1490:In the six trading days since the UAL labor-management buy-out group failed to get bank financing, culminating Friday with the withdrawal of its partner British Airways PLC, UAL stock has plummeted by 41% to 168 1/2 from 285 1/4. 
14/wsj_1490:The arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the UAL deal gets patched up again, as they did in 1982 when Occidental Petroleum Co. rescued them with a $4 billion takeover of Cities Service. 
14/wsj_1490:That's based on a multiple of anywhere between 8.5 to 10 times UAL earnings, which are estimated to come in somewhere around $16 a share this year. 
14/wsj_1490:Airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market's price-earnings ratio -- which is currently about 13 times earnings.
14/wsj_1490:That's because airline earnings, like those of auto makers, have been subject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy. 
14/wsj_1490:That analysis matches up with stock traders' reports that, despite the huge drop in the stock, UAL hasn't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings. 
14/wsj_1490:So anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover, and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event. 
14/wsj_1490:Other observers note that UAL's board, having accepted a bid of $300 a share, might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal.
14/wsj_1490:By that logic, the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months, even though the eventual price might be higher. 
14/wsj_1490:However, investment bankers say that banks aren't likely to lend the almost $5 billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater than the 17% in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Corp. in July. 
14/wsj_1490:That leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $1 billion -- far more than either they or the flight attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone. 
14/wsj_1490:One obstacle to the pilots' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership.
14/wsj_1490:Investors such as Marvin Davis of Los Angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they, not the pilots, must have control. 
14/wsj_1490:One way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders.
14/wsj_1490:The pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions, using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking. 
14/wsj_1490:The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied.
14/wsj_1490:In advising the UAL board on the various bids for the airline, starting with one for $240 a share from Mr. Davis, the investment bank of First Boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company, depending on appraisal methods and assumptions. 
14/wsj_1490:Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark, First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $250 to $344 a share based on UAL's results for the 12 months ending last June 30, but only $235 to $266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989.
14/wsj_1490:Using estimates of the company's future earnings under a variety of scenarios, First Boston estimated UAL's value at $248 to $287 a share if its future labor costs conform to Wall Street projections; $237 to $275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at NWA; $98 to $121 under an adverse labor settlement, and $229 to $270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike. 
14/wsj_1490:And using liquidation value assuming the sale of all UAL assets, First Boston estimated the airline is worth $253 to $303 a share. 
14/wsj_1490:American Airlines parent AMR and USAir Group, both subject to takeover efforts themselves, have each warned of declining results. 
14/wsj_1490:Some analysts don't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots.
14/wsj_1490:Wall Street traders and analysts estimate that takeover stock traders own UAL stock and options equal to as many as 6.5 million shares, or about 30% of the total outstanding.
14/wsj_1490:Frank Gallagher, an analyst with Phoenix Capital Corp. in New York, estimates that the arbs paid an average of about $280 a share for their UAL positions.
14/wsj_1491:Eastern Enterprises, bolstered by improved tonnages in its marine-shipping unit, had a narrower third-quarter net loss of $1.1 million, or five cents a share. 
14/wsj_1491:Last year, Eastern had a quarter loss of $1.7 million, or eight cents a share. 
14/wsj_1491:The Weston, Mass., utilities and marine-transport concern said results for the third quarter, usually a money-losing one because of the seasonality of the gas business, were also aided by higher gas sales and the May 1989 acquisition of Water Products Company. 
14/wsj_1491:For the nine months, Eastern had net income of $41.8 million, or $1.80 a share, up 23% from $33.9 million or $1.46 a share a year ago.
14/wsj_1492:Convex makes supercomputers that sell for up to $2 million and has an installed base of more than 550 systems and 340 customers world-wide.
14/wsj_1492:During the third quarter, it said, it won several significant contracts, including a five-year contract with the National Institutes of Health valued at an estimated $8 million. 
14/wsj_1492:Earlier this month, Convex made a bid to outflank other supercomputer competitors like Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. by adopting an open set of standards and introducing new hardware and software to link different systems.
14/wsj_1492:Convex also recently agreed to use Posix, a standard for the computer language called UNIX. Posix is one of three or four versions of UNIX, but it is increasingly required by the federal government as it tries to standardize its computer systems.
14/wsj_1493:Troubled Saatchi & Saatchi Co. has attracted offers for some of its advertising units, with potential suitors including Interpublic Group, but has rejected them, people familiar with the company said. 
14/wsj_1493:More recently, Interpublic inquired about one of Saatchi's smaller communications companies -- identified as the Rowland public relations firm by several industry executives -- but again was rebuffed, they said.
14/wsj_1493:He added, "We have no intention of selling either business." 
14/wsj_1493:In the midst of the current turmoil, Saatchi is attempting to shore up its ad businesses.
14/wsj_1493:It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel, head of Saatchi's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit, to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi.
14/wsj_1493:But Saatchi's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses.
14/wsj_1493:While Saatchi's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts, its smaller businesses are quite attractive. 
14/wsj_1493:Campbell-Mithun-Esty, for example, has had big problems at its New York office, but offers strong offices in other areas of the country, including Minneapolis and Chicago.
14/wsj_1493:That would would make it appealing to a network such as Interpublic that already has a healthy New York presence. (While there would be some client conflicts, they wouldn't be nearly as onerous as with Saatchi's other agencies.) Campbell-Mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency network: It has billings of about $850 million and blue-chip clients including General Mills, Jeep/Eagle and Dow Brands. 
14/wsj_1493:Rowland, meanwhile, has expanded aggressively, and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm, according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms.
14/wsj_1493:It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic, one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own.
14/wsj_1493:Despite Saatchi's firm stand against selling its ad units, U.S. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units.
14/wsj_1493:Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, in a recent interview, said he might sell "a marginal agency or office." Analysts believe he may ultimately dispose of some of the non-advertising businesses. 
14/wsj_1493:Prudential Insurance Co. of America said it selected four agencies to pitch its $60 million to $70 million account. 
14/wsj_1493:In addition to Backer Spielvogel Bates, a Saatchi unit that has handled the account since 1970, the other agencies include Lowe Marschalk, a unit of the Lowe Group; Grey Advertising; and WPP Group's Scali, McCabe, Sloves agency.
14/wsj_1493:The Jamaica Tourist Board, in the wake of Young & Rubicam's indictment on charges that it bribed Jamaican officials to win the account in 1981, released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident. 
14/wsj_1493:Among other things, the memo contends that Young & Rubicam gave false assurances that the investigation wouldn't uncover any information that would "embarrass the government of Jamaica or the Jamaica Tourist Board." It also contends that Young & Rubicam never told the tourist board about its relationship with Ad Ventures, a Jamaican firm hired by the agency.
14/wsj_1493:The U.S. indictment charges Ad Ventures was a front used to funnel kickbacks to the then-minister of tourism. 
14/wsj_1493:The memo also chastises the agency for the timing of its announcement Thursday that it would no longer handle the $5 million to $6 million account.
14/wsj_1493:WHO'S NEWS: John Wells, 47, former president and chief executive of N W Ayer's Chicago office, was named management director and director of account services at WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson agency in Chicago. . . . Shelly Lazarus, 42, was named president and chief operating officer of Ogilvy & Mather Direct, the direct mail division of WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather agency. 
14/wsj_1494:Grand Metropolitan PLC, the United Kingdom food and beverage group that owns Pillsbury Inc. of the U.S., announced a reshuffling of board-level executive duties intended to fit the company's recent expansion. 
14/wsj_1494:David Tagg, formerly in charge of gambling operations, was appointed chief executive for retailing and property.
14/wsj_1494:Peter Cawdron, group strategy development director, and Bill Shardlow, group personnel director, will become part of the board's management committee. 
14/wsj_1495:David Baltimore, who has just been named president of Rockefeller University, already knows what it's like to go through life with "Nobel laureate" appended to one's name.
14/wsj_1495:Both of Dr. Baltimore's public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed Joshua Lederberg as head of the prestigious Rockefeller research institution.
14/wsj_1495:It came to light that a substantial number of Rockefeller's faculty were upset over or even opposed to Dr. Baltimore's impending appointment. 
14/wsj_1495:They were disturbed at what they regarded as Dr. Baltimore's confrontational attitude toward the Dingell committee, which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore.
14/wsj_1495:Readers of these columns ("The Science Police," May 15) will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the Dingell committee's larger investigation, which touched MIT, Tufts, Duke, the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere.
14/wsj_1495:Rep. Dingell even managed to enlist the services of the Secret Service in his investigation of the Baltimore paper. 
14/wsj_1495:Insofar as Mr. Dingell has a special interest in NIH and the institutions that receive its funding, the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. Baltimore's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron, whose behavior reminded Dr. Baltimore of the McCarthy era. 
14/wsj_1495:John Dingell demagogues a David Baltimore, animal-rights activists do $3.5 million of damage to labs at the U.Cal-Davis, Meryl Streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows, Jeremy Rifkin files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments, and Dutch-elm-disease researcher Gary Strobel's own colleagues at Montana State denounce him for "violating" EPA rules. 
14/wsj_1495:Dingell, by the way, has decreed another NIH investigation of the Baltimore paper, adding to several previous investigations.
14/wsj_1495:Fortunately, there are signs that increasing numbers of scientists understand the necessity of speaking out.
14/wsj_1495:In a media-linked world, scientists may earn wide praise and even Nobels for their work, but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content, funding and goals of that work.
14/wsj_1496:Wisconsin Toy Co. said it definitively agreed to acquire closely held Everything's a Dollar Inc. of Virginia Beach, Va., for stock currently valued at about $4.7 million. 
14/wsj_1496:The Milwaukee toy retailer said the agreement calls for Everything's a Dollar holders to receive for their holdings a total of 354,600 newly issued Wisconsin Toy shares.
14/wsj_1496:A company official said Arthur Borie, until January chief operating officer of Pic 'N Save Inc., will buy a 20% stake in the new Wisconsin Toy subsidiary, and will act as head of Everything's a Dollar. 
14/wsj_1497:While welcoming Nicholas McInnes's Sept. 18 letter offering corrections to your "World-Wide Tax Revolution" table (editorial page, Aug. 29), I am surprised that he neglected other errors that, for some of us, strike close to home. 
14/wsj_1497:As a Channel Islander, I was amazed to see my birthplace listed as one of "86 countries with an income tax." Despite a history of heated local debate on the topic, my passport clearly reads "British citizen." Whether Mr. McInnes's oversight is merely a sign of a mainlander's benign neglect is a question my fellow Channel Islanders (and friends on the Isle of Man) will continue to ponder. 
14/wsj_1498:Roland J. Hawkins, chairman of Jet Vacations Inc., was elected to the board of this cruise line.
14/wsj_1499:We see a whole flock of programs that will impose significant costs on the American economy in the form of burdensome regulation and higher liabilities.
14/wsj_1499:The Bush White House is breeding non-duck ducks the same way the Nixon White House did: It hops on an issue that is unopposable -- cleaner air, better treatment of the disabled, better child care.
14/wsj_1499:It comes up with a toned-down version of a Democratic proposal.
14/wsj_1499:It would create 38,000 local day-care commissions, answerable to the Department of Health and Human Services.
14/wsj_1499:The House bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways.
14/wsj_1499:So instead of building more efficient modern plants, utilities stick scrubbers on the old plants.
14/wsj_1499:Proponents of the nationwide standards say the cost for car buyers would be about $500 per car.
14/wsj_1499:Nobody knows how many billions of dollars the Americans With Disabilities Act will cost, because nobody knows what the bill entails.
14/wsj_1499:It is an intentionally vague document that will create a wave of litigation.
14/wsj_1499:The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions.
14/wsj_1499:All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists, some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American people, states and local governments. 
14/wsj_1499:Running for President in 1980 and 1988, George Bush also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s.
14/wsj_1499:In fact, during last year's campaign, the entire nation constantly heard Mr. Bush tout his accomplishments as head of the Task Force on Regulatory Relief. 
14/wsj_1499:"Government continues to inhibit the productivity of our citizenry and the international competitiveness of American business," the vice president declared when he was head of the task force. 
14/wsj_1499:But with the impending passage of these new programs, Mr. Bush will surely be sending many people hurtling back into the regulatory thicket that he had helped cut back.
14/wsj_1499:By 1986, the number of federal regulators was down to about 103,000.
14/wsj_1499:Holding the dam on taxes is the most important task of the Bush presidency.
14/wsj_1499:We would have thought by now, though, that there was a significant core of people involved in government life who understood that direct taxation isn't the only way to slow down an economy.
14/wsj_1499:The Bush administration ought to be setting aside some of its buckshot for the non-duck ducks. 
15/wsj_1500:Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past week.
15/wsj_1500:This has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to 16% from their current 15% level to defend the pound, economists and foreign exchange market analysts say. 
15/wsj_1500:"The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side," said Chris Dillow, senior U.K. economist at Nomura Research Institute. 
15/wsj_1500:"If there is another bad trade number, there could be an awful lot of pressure," noted Simon Briscoe, U.K. economist for Midland Montagu, a unit of Midland Bank PLC. 
15/wsj_1500:The August deficit and the #2.2 billion gap registered in July are topped only by the #2.3 billion deficit of October 1988. 
15/wsj_1500:Mr. Briscoe, who also forecasts a #1.3 billion current account gap, warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling, the currency won't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions. 
15/wsj_1500:In his Mansion House speech, Mr. Lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect.
15/wsj_1500:This compares with a 1.6% rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5.4% increase from the second quarter of 1988. 
15/wsj_1500:Mr. Dillow said the data show the economy "is still quite strong," but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises. 
15/wsj_1500:Thursday, he reminded his audience that the government "cannot allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness." 
15/wsj_1500:Sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in Mr. Lawson's promise Friday.
15/wsj_1500:Economists suggested that if the pound falls much below 2.90 marks, the government will be forced to increase rates to 16%, both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged. 
15/wsj_1500:Currency analysts predict that in the coming week the foreign exchange market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals, keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by U.S. Federal Reserve. 
15/wsj_1500:In Tokyo on Monday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.95 yen, up from Friday's Tokyo close of 141.35 yen. 
15/wsj_1501:In an Oct. 19 letter to A.P. Green's board, East Rock said the offer is subject to the signing of a merger agreement by no later than Oct. 31. 
15/wsj_1501:The company is a Mexico, Mo., maker of refractory products. 
15/wsj_1501:New York-based John Kuhns and Robert MacDonald control East Rock Partners Inc., the sole general partner of East Rock Partners L.P.
15/wsj_1501:The sole limited partner of the partnership is Westwood Brick Lime Inc., an indirect subsidiary of Westwood Group Inc.
15/wsj_1502:Freight rates, declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation, are bottoming out, turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation. 
15/wsj_1502:"Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation, and rates are starting to move up" at a rate "close to or slightly more than the inflation rate," said Clifford Sayre, director of logistics at Du Pont Co. 
15/wsj_1502:Only 10% of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease, compared with 30% who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years. "This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates," said Bernard LaLonde, a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus. 
15/wsj_1502:The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation.
15/wsj_1502:Shippers cut about $35 billion from their annual, inter-city truck and rail costs, to about $150 billion, or about 6.4% of gross national product, down from 8% of GNP in 1981.
15/wsj_1502:But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system, rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates. 
15/wsj_1502:Transport rates won't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy." 
15/wsj_1502:Robert Delaney, a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc., Cambridge, Mass., said "We've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions.
15/wsj_1502:You'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously." 
15/wsj_1502:Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers. "There's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck," said Gerard McCullough, lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
15/wsj_1502:Less-than-truckload companies, which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer, discounted away a 4.7% rate increase implemented last April.
15/wsj_1502:Such rate increases "will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports," said Richard Connors, a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc., the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan. 
15/wsj_1502:Ship companies carrying bulk commodities, such as oil, grain, coal and iron ore, have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years.
15/wsj_1503:MGM Grand Inc. said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of six million common shares. 
15/wsj_1504:Mr. Stone thought the discipline was unfair; he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons.
15/wsj_1504:After the three members of the court introduced themselves, the chairman of the panel said: "Go ahead and tell us what happened.
15/wsj_1504:The only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists, one of whom knew Mr. Stone's case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture. 
15/wsj_1504:Over a cup of coffee, Mr. Stone told his story.
15/wsj_1504:The court is called the Management Appeals Committee, or just "MAC," and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year. 
15/wsj_1504:Alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at Federal Express in Memphis, the Defense and Underseas Systems divisions of Honeywell in Minneapolis, a General Electric plant in Columbia, Md., or a number of other companies.
15/wsj_1504:These firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world: the rise of what I call corporate due process.
15/wsj_1504:Although corporate due process is practiced today in few companies -- perhaps 40 to 60 -- it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry.
15/wsj_1504:In the coming decade a majority of people-oriented companies are likely to adopt it. 
15/wsj_1504:Corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons.
15/wsj_1504:It must be able to handle most of the complaints that cannot be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates, else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases.
15/wsj_1504:At Polaroid, the Personnel Policy Planning Committee may hear only about 20 cases a year; the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages.
15/wsj_1504:At TWA, the System Board of Adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year, only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists.
15/wsj_1504:At Citicorp, the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel's skill in complaint-resolution. 
15/wsj_1504:In a typical year, up to 20% of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment.
15/wsj_1504:In a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle. 
15/wsj_1504:In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator, teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life, for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen.
15/wsj_1504:International Business Machines and Bank of America are among the companies using the single-adjudicator approach. 
15/wsj_1504:Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints.
15/wsj_1504:Naturally, one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it.
15/wsj_1504:At IBM, the company's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive.
15/wsj_1504:Federal Express goes further in this respect than any company I know of with both Frederick Smith and James Barksdale, chief executive and chief operating officer, respectively, sitting in on the Appeals Board almost every Tuesday to decide cases. 
15/wsj_1504:Mr. Ewing is a consultant based in Winchester, Mass., and author of "Justice on the Job: Resolving Grievances in the Nonunion Workplace" (Harvard Business School Press, 1989). 
15/wsj_1505:At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 112.16 points to 35486.38.
15/wsj_1505:The Nikkei, which reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening, surrendered part of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit-taking. 
15/wsj_1505:The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed in the First Section, which gained 22.78 points Thursday, was up 14.06 points, or 0.53%, at 2679.72. 
15/wsj_1505:The Nikkei continued to gain for the rest of the week, adding 1017.69 points in four days -- more than erasing Monday's losses. 
15/wsj_1505:Breweries attracted investors because of their land property holdings that could figure in development or other plans, traders said. 
15/wsj_1505:Housings, constructions and pharmaceuticals continued to be bought following Thursday's gains because of strong earnings outlooks. 
15/wsj_1505:The key Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 10.2 points lower at 2179.1, above its intraday low of 2176.9, but off the day's high of 2189.
15/wsj_1505:The index finished 2.4% under its close of 2233.9 the previous Friday, although it recouped some of the sharp losses staged early last week on the back of Wall Street's fall. 
15/wsj_1505:London was weak throughout Friday's trading, however, on what dealers attributed to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week's potentially important U.K. trade figures for September.
15/wsj_1505:The FT-SE 100 largely remained within an 11-point range establshed within the first hour of trading before it eased to an intraday low late in the session when a flurry of program selling pushed Wall Street lower. 
15/wsj_1505:Volume was extremely thin at 351.3 million shares, the lightest volume of the week and modestly under Thursday's 387.4 million shares. 
15/wsj_1505:They added that market-makers were largely sidelined after aggressively supporting the market Thursday in their quest to cover internal shortages of FT-SE 100 shares.
15/wsj_1505:The key corporate news of the day was that British Airways decided to withdraw from a management-led bid for UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines. 
15/wsj_1505:The next most active top-tier stock was B.A.T Industries, the target of Sir James Goldsmith's #13.4 billion bid.
15/wsj_1505:B.A.T ended the day at 778, down 5, on turnover of 7.5 million shares.
15/wsj_1505:In other active shares, Trusthouse Forte shed 10 to 294 on volume of 6.4 million shares after a Barclays De Zoete Wedd downgrading, while Hillsdown Holdings, a food products concern, was boosted 2 to 271 after it disclosed it would seek shareholder approval to begin share repurchases. 
15/wsj_1505:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
15/wsj_1506:The U.S. is required to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives, government officials said. 
15/wsj_1506:The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
15/wsj_1506:The existence of the guidelines has become known since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday.
15/wsj_1506:Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. 
15/wsj_1506:However, the disclosure of the guidelines, first reported last night by NBC News, is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress.
15/wsj_1506:A statement issued by the office of the committee chairman, Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in Panama.
15/wsj_1506:The statement added, "Someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government.
15/wsj_1506:Not only does this come close to a violation of law, it violates the trust we have all worked to develop." 
15/wsj_1506:Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine, the panel's vice chairman, said of the disclosure that "a text torn out of context is a pretext, and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion." 
15/wsj_1506:Instead, both congressional and administration officials agreed, it grew out of talks about coup-planning in Panama that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October. 
15/wsj_1506:The guideline wasn't a law, but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations.
15/wsj_1506:One administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. "gets wind" of somebody else's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator's life.
15/wsj_1506:Although the notification guideline wasn't carried out in this month's coup attempt, some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama.
15/wsj_1506:The issue came to a head last year, officials recalled, partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts.
15/wsj_1506:Last week, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups. 
15/wsj_1506:The administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame Congress for restrictions the White House said have hampered its freedom of action.
15/wsj_1506:The three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines, without changing the basic assassination ban, to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders. 
15/wsj_1506:The new argument over the notification guideline, however, could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed. 
15/wsj_1507:(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 
15/wsj_1507:The idea was to let small investors, the backbone of the fund business, deal in the money market's high short-term interest rates.
15/wsj_1507:This had been the exclusive province of those rich enough to use six-figure sums to get income that was figured beyond the third or fourth decimal place. 
15/wsj_1507:The now-standard price of $1 a share came about by accident.
15/wsj_1507:His successor approved the $1 price in the process of clearing the backed-up papers on his desk.
15/wsj_1507:When Dreyfus started the first advertising-backed retail fund in February 1974, it was priced at $10 a share (and reached $1 billion in assets in one year.) Dreyfus moved to the $1 price after the SEC set standards -- an average 120-day maturity of high-grade paper -- that are still the rule. 
15/wsj_1507:Eventually, the money funds' success forced relaxation of curbs on bank interest rates to allow banks to offer competing yields.
15/wsj_1507:The new instrument also introduced many to the industry -- 30% of fund owners (there are more than 54 million accounts) started with a money fund. 
15/wsj_1508:Procter & Gamble Co. and Noxell Corp. said they received early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act regarding the proposed $1.4 billion merger of Noxell into P&G. 
15/wsj_1508:Shareholders of Noxell, of Hunt Valley, Md., will vote on the merger at a special meeting on Nov. 30, the companies said. 
15/wsj_1508:P&G, Cincinnati, agreed to exchange 0.272 share of its common stock for each share of Noxell common and Class B stock, a total of about 11 million P&G shares. 
15/wsj_1508:The transaction would mark the entry of P&G into cosmetics.
15/wsj_1508:The company already markets a wide range of detergents, food, household and health-care products. 
15/wsj_1509:Shareholders of Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.
15/wsj_1509:H. postponed their formal endorsement of a merger with Daimler-Benz AG until another meeting on Nov. 17. 
15/wsj_1509:The owners of the defense and aerospace concern, which include three regional states, several industrial companies and banks, met Friday to discuss the final terms of the transaction, in which Daimler-Benz will acquire 50.01% of 
15/wsj_1509:But agreement aparently couldn't be reached because of opposition from the states of Hamburg and Bremen, which are demanding more influence over the German Airbus operations and a better guarantee against job losses in the troubled Northern German region. 
15/wsj_1509:The two states and the state of Bavaria still hold a majority in MBB, but their stake will fall to around 30% after Daimler-Benz acquires its stake in the concern. 
15/wsj_1510:Jeffrey E. Levin was named vice president and chief economist of this commodity futures and options exchange.
15/wsj_1510:He had been associate professor in the department of finance at Seton Hall University. 
15/wsj_1511:SIERRA TUCSON Cos. said it completed its initial public offering of 2.5 million common shares, which raised $30 million.
15/wsj_1511:The Tucson, Ariz., operator of addiction-treatment centers said proceeds will be used for expansion, to pay debt and for general corporate purposes.
15/wsj_1512:The consensus view on real GNP, the total value of the nation's output of goods and services adjusted for inflation, calls for a 2.3% gain, down from the second quarter's 2.5%, according to MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York.
15/wsj_1512:Many economists see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of the year, with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession.
15/wsj_1512:The recent one-day, 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems to be significant to economists mainly for its tacit comment on the poor quality of third-quarter profits now being reported. 
15/wsj_1512:"The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling," says Michael K. Evans, president of Evans Economics Inc., Washington.
15/wsj_1512:On the other hand, Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake "to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP." His estimate of 3.3% for third-quarter GNP is higher than the consensus largely because he believes current inventories aren't as low as official figures indicate.
15/wsj_1512:Edward J. Campbell, economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., New York, noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas. 
15/wsj_1512:Gary Ciminero, economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, Providence, R.I., expects the deflator to rise 3.7%, well below the second quarter's 4.6%, partly because of what he believes will be temporarily better price behavior.
15/wsj_1512:He expects real GNP growth of only 2.1% for the quarter, noting a wider trade deficit, slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures. 
15/wsj_1512:Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp., Minneapolis, holds that the recent stock-market volatility "increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news" from recent trade deficit, employment and housing reports. 
15/wsj_1512:Charles Lieberman, managing director of financial markets reasearch at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp., New York, said Hurrican Hugo shaved 0.1% to 0.2% from personal-income growth, because of greatly diminished rental income from tourism. 
15/wsj_1512:Durable goods orders for September, due out tomorrow, are expected to show a slip of 1%, compared with August's 3.9% increase.
15/wsj_1512:As usual, estimates on the fickle report are wide, running from a drop of 3.5% to a gain of 1.6%. 
15/wsj_1513:HASTINGS MANUFACTURING Co. declared a regular quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share and an extra dividend of five cents a share on its common stock, payable Dec. 15 to shares of record Nov. 17.
15/wsj_1513:This is the 11th consecutive quarter in which the company has paid shareholders an extra dividend of five cents.
15/wsj_1514:I.E.P. Securities Ltd., a unit of Mr. Brierley's Hong Kong-based Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., boosted its holdings in Vickers to 38.8 million shares. 
15/wsj_1514:In May, Mr. Brierley's stake shrank to 8.7% after ranging between 9% and 11% for much of the previous year. 
15/wsj_1515:When Rune Andersson set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s, he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants. 
15/wsj_1515:"All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology, electronics or biotechnology, and get out of mature basic industries," Mr. Andersson recalls.
15/wsj_1515:It was a gutsy move for a little-known executive, fired after only two months as president of his previous company.
15/wsj_1515:The board had also been expected to approve a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares.
15/wsj_1515:Mr. Andersson says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help erase the "conglomerate stigma" that has held down Trelleborg's share price.
15/wsj_1515:Trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50% of both units. 
15/wsj_1515:A family foundation set up by late founder Henry Dunker controls 59% of Trelleborg's voting shares outstanding.
15/wsj_1515:That growth is the result of Mr. Andersson's shopping spree, during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years. 
15/wsj_1515:Most of the new additions were barely profitable, if not outright loss makers.
15/wsj_1515:Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker AB Electrolux, Mr. Andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results. 
15/wsj_1515:The treatment turned Trelleborg into one of Scandinavia's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns.
15/wsj_1515:Many analysts expect Mr. Andersson, who owns 1.7% of the company, to be named Trelleborg's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year.
15/wsj_1515:Last month, in his boldest move yet, Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada's Noranda Inc. in a joint $2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern, Falconbridge Ltd. Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern. 
15/wsj_1515:Booming metals prices have fueled Trelleborg's recent profit surge, raising mining's share of pretax profit to 68% this year from a big loss two years earlier.
15/wsj_1515:Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture. 
15/wsj_1515:But such partnerships are common in mining, where there aren't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner," Trelleborg's president says. 
15/wsj_1515:Perhaps more important, both companies share Mr. Andersson's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries. 
15/wsj_1515:"If the 1980s were a decade of consumption, the '90s will be the investment decade," Mr. Andersson says. 
15/wsj_1515:"The whole of Europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment," he says. "That's beginning to change.
15/wsj_1516:Apple Computer Inc. posted improved fiscal fourth-quarter profit due largely to a $48 million gain on the sale of its stock in Adobe Systems Inc. 
15/wsj_1516:Proceeds of the Adobe sale brought net income in the quarter to $161.1 million, or $1.24 a share. 
15/wsj_1516:Mr. Sculley also indicated that sagging margins, which dogged the company through most of 1989, began to turn up in the fourth quarter as chip prices eased. 
15/wsj_1516:For all of fiscal 1989, however, the average gross margin was 49%, below the average 1988 gross margin of 51%. 
15/wsj_1516:Lower component costs -- especially for DRAMs, or dynamic random access memory chips -- were cited for the easing of margin pressure on the company, a spokeswoman said. 
15/wsj_1516:Looking ahead to 1990, Mr. Sculley predicted "another year of significant revenue growth," along with improved profitability, as the recovery in gross margins continues into 1990. 
15/wsj_1517:Mr. Schantz was vice president and chief operating officer of the Acrylic division of Polycast Technology Corp. Separately, the board expanded to six members with the election of David L. Holewinski, a consultant.
15/wsj_1518:Terry L. Haines, formerly general manager of Canadian operations, was elected to the new position of vice president, North American sales, of this plastics concern.
15/wsj_1518:Also, Larry A. Kushkin, executive vice president, North American operations, was named head of the company's international automotive operations, another new position.
15/wsj_1518:He remains an executive vice president, the company said, and his new position reflects "the growing importance of the world automotive market as a market for A. Schulman's high performance plastic materials." Gordon Trimmer will succeed Mr. Haines as manager of Canadian operations, and Mr. Kushkin's former position isn't being filled at this time, the company said. 
15/wsj_1519:General Electric Co. said it signed a contract with the developers of the Ocean State Power project for the second phase of an independent $400 million power plant, which is being built in Burrillville, R.I. 
15/wsj_1519:GE, along with a division of Ebasco, a subsidiary of Enserch Corp., have been building the first 250-megawatt phase of the project, which they expect to complete in late 1990.
15/wsj_1520:The Environmental Protection Agency is getting a lot out of the Superfund program.
15/wsj_1520:Of the $4.4 billion spent so far on the program, 60% is going for administrative costs, management and research, the Office of Technology Assessment just reported.
15/wsj_1520:Only 36 of 1,200 priority cleanup sites have been "decontaminated." Over the next 50 years, $500 billion is earmarked for the program.
15/wsj_1521:Chambers Development Co. said its Security Bureau Inc. unit purchased two security concerns in Florida that will add $2.1 million of annual revenue. 
15/wsj_1521:Purchase of the businesses serving Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, Fla., is part of a plan by Chambers to expand in the growing security industry.
15/wsj_1522:The West German chemical concern called the moves a further step in the internationalization of its business activities. 
15/wsj_1523:David H. Eisenberg, 53 years old, was named president and chief operating officer of Imasco's 500-store Peoples Drug Stores Inc. unit, based in Alexandria, Va.
15/wsj_1524:Lotus Development Corp. is in talks to sell its Signal stock-quote service to Infotechnology Inc., the New York parent of Financial News Network, people familiar with the negotiations said.
15/wsj_1524:Lotus, Cambridge, Mass., has been rumored to have the sale of the four-year-old unit under consideration for a year.
15/wsj_1524:The business isn't related to Lotus's main businesses of making computer software and publishing information on compact disks. 
15/wsj_1525:He surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the Philippine government's Asset Privatization Trust for the sale of a 36% interest in the country's largest paper mill.
15/wsj_1525:The agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than $80 million. 
15/wsj_1525:Of the four, only the bank and the plant drew bids -- one apiece. 
15/wsj_1525:In October 1987, President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would "get out of business" by selling all or part of the state's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos.
15/wsj_1525:In addition, the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines, the national carrier, an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls "the bellwether of privatization." All told, there are assets on the line valued at up to $1.03 billion. 
15/wsj_1525:The privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds.
15/wsj_1525:Much of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion-dollar agrarian-reform program.
15/wsj_1525:Most recently, a lack of buyers has been added to the list. 
15/wsj_1525:Rather than gathering momentum, the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets.
15/wsj_1525:The Asset Privatization Trust, the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties, has recorded sales of more than $500 million since it began functioning in December 1986.
15/wsj_1525:But its success has been largely in the sale of small, nonperforming companies, which are valued for their assets. 
15/wsj_1525:Ramon Garcia, the Asset Trust's executive trustee, admits to what he calls "temporary setbacks." In light of the poor results recently, he says, the agency is adopting an "attitude of flexibility." 
15/wsj_1525:October's troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank, Associated Bank, for the minimum price of 671 million pesos ($31 million).
15/wsj_1525:At the end of the month, the agency again will offer the bank.
15/wsj_1525:But instead of a minimum price, only a target price will be established. 
15/wsj_1525:In 1983, the loans were converted into equity, giving Manila 98% of the bank, but with the understanding that Mr. Ty had repurchase rights.
15/wsj_1525:Separately, the government will try again within a month to sell the 36% stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines, or Picop, as the paper mill is known.
15/wsj_1525:As it stands now, the government would continue to hold 45% of Picop after the 36% stake is sold. (About 7.5% of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity.) Potential buyers, mostly foreign companies, are reluctant to take a non-controlling stake in a company that, by the government's own reckoning, needs some $100 million in new capital for rehabilitation. 
15/wsj_1525:The prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers, including a member of the Elders group of Australia, to pull out of the bidding, the bankers and analysts say. 
15/wsj_1525:Under government regulations, however, foreign ownership of Picop's equity is limited to 40%. 
15/wsj_1525:Even though the government would retain the 45% stake in Picop, critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners.
15/wsj_1525:A series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short-changing the government over the Picop sale.
15/wsj_1525:Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill's sale, both prompted by the criticism of the agency. 
15/wsj_1525:The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines, in which it has a 99% stake.
15/wsj_1526:This maker of electronic measuring devices named two new directors, increasing board membership to nine.
15/wsj_1526:The new directors are Gordon M. Sprenger, president and chief executive officer of LifeSpan Inc., and Peter S. Willmott, chairman and chief executive officer of Willmott Services Inc. 
15/wsj_1527:Gerard E. Wood, 51 years old, was elected president, chief executive officer and a director of this minerals and materials company.
15/wsj_1527:Mr. Wood has been president and chief executive of Steep Rock Resources Inc. 
15/wsj_1528:The new holding company, Webster/Eagle Bancorp Inc., will have about $1.2 billion of assets and 19 banking offices in Connecticut.
15/wsj_1528:In the merger, each share of Webster, based in Waterbury, will be converted into one share of the new company.
15/wsj_1528:Each share of Eagle, based in Bristol, will become 0.95 share of Webster/Eagle.

15/wsj_1528:Harold W. Smith Sr., chairman of Webster, will become chairman emeritus and a director of the new company.
15/wsj_1528:Ralph T. Linsley, vice chairman of Eagle, will become vice chairman of Webster/Eagle.
15/wsj_1528:The board will be made up of seven directors of each holding company. 
15/wsj_1528:In an interview, James Smith said the banks' "markets are contiguous and their business philosophies are similar and conservative." Nonperforming loans will make up only about 0.5% of the combined banks' total loans outstanding, he said. 
15/wsj_1528:At June 30, Webster, which owns First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Waterbury, had assets of $699 million.
15/wsj_1528:Eagle, which controls Bristol Federal Savings Bank and First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Torrington, had assets of $469.6 million on that date. 
15/wsj_1529:Guillermo Ortiz's Sept. 15 Americas column, "Mexico's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug," is a refreshingly clear statement of his government's commitment to privatization, and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well.
15/wsj_1529:The Mexico-United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as Mexico's undersecretary of finance view his country's reforms "in the context of a larger, world-wide process" of profound change toward free-market economics, especially in the statist countries. 
15/wsj_1529:In the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40% of the total equity of the airline.
15/wsj_1529:In language that sidesteps the issue, Mr. Ortiz writes, "The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas's plan to modernize Mexico's economy. . . ." Yet clearly, modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said to have caught the "privatization bug." 
15/wsj_1529:A long succession of Mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to, without having to answer to the public.
15/wsj_1530:The board of this Ponce, Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter.
15/wsj_1530:Ponce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. 
15/wsj_1531:The group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $225 to $240 a share, or $5.09 billion to $5.42 billion.
15/wsj_1531:But to avoid the risk of rejection, the group doesn't plan to submit the plan formally at a UAL board meeting today.
15/wsj_1531:But the pilots union, which has been pushing for a takeover since 1987, appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it hasn't found a partner to replace British Air. 
15/wsj_1531:After the collapse of the last effort, the group doesn't plan to make any formal proposal without binding commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed. 
15/wsj_1531:Under the type of transaction being discussed, the pilot-management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders.
15/wsj_1531:The failed takeover would have given UAL employees 75% voting control of the nation's second-largest airline, with management getting 10% control and British Air 15%.
15/wsj_1531:One option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period.
15/wsj_1531:The board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote, particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale.
15/wsj_1531:Mr. Davis had paid $6 million for Citicorp's backing of his last bid.
15/wsj_1531:On Friday, British Air issued a statement saying it "does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future." However, several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out.

15/wsj_1532:The features will focus on "parenting, family health and nutrition, and financial management," and will carry 30 seconds of advertising. 
15/wsj_1533:WEIRTON STEEL Corp. said it completed a $300 million sale of 10-year notes, the final step in the 1984 buy-out of the company from National Steel Corp.
15/wsj_1533:Weirton, of Weirton, W. Va., said $60.3 million of the proceeds were used to prepay the remaining amounts on the note outstanding to National Intergroup Inc., the parent of National Steel.
15/wsj_1534:Lep Group PLC of Britain, which holds a 62.42% stake in Profit Systems Inc., said it is considering courses of action that could result in its having "active control" of the company. 
15/wsj_1534:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Lep Group said a possible course of action may include acquiring some or all of the Profit Systems shares it doesn't already own.
15/wsj_1534:It noted, however, that it hasn't determined any specific terms of a possible transaction. 
15/wsj_1535:U.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold, special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. reserve position -- its ability to draw foreign currencies -- at the IMF. 
15/wsj_1535:The nation's holdings of foreign currencies increased $5.67 billion in September to $39.08 billion, while its gold reserves were virtually unchanged at $11.07 billion. 
15/wsj_1535:U.S. holdings of IMF special drawing rights last month rose $247 million, to $9.49 billion, and its reserve position at the IMF increased $142 million, to $8.79 billion. 
15/wsj_1536:Alusuisse of America Inc. plans to sell its Consolidated Aluminum Corp. subsidiary as part of its strategy to focus more on aluminum packaging in the U.S. 
15/wsj_1536:Alusuisse, of New York, declined to say how much it expects to get for the unit; the company has hired First Boston Corp. to help identify bidders.
15/wsj_1536:Alusuisse is a subsidiary of Swiss Aluminium Ltd., a Zurich, Switzerland, producer of aluminum, chemicals and packaging products. 
15/wsj_1536:Consolidated, which had 1988 revenue of $400 million, makes aluminum sheet and foil products at its Hannibal, Ohio, and Jackson, Tenn., rolling mills and recycles aluminum at a plant in Bens Run, W.Va. 
15/wsj_1537:Manhattan National Corp. said Michael A. Conway, president and chief executive officer, was elected chief executive of the holding company's two principal insurance subsidiaries. 
15/wsj_1537:Mr. Conway, 42 years old, was elected chairman, president and chief executive of Manhattan Life Insurance Co. and president and chief executive of Manhattan National Life Insurance Co. 
15/wsj_1537:Harry Rossi, 69, chairman of the holding company, also remains chairman of Manhattan National Life Insurance Co. 
15/wsj_1537:Mr. Conway was executive vice president and chief investment officer of Union Central Life Insurance Co., of Cincinnati, in 1987, when Union Central bought a 54% interest in Manhattan National Corp.

15/wsj_1538:Daniel J. Terra, a director of First Illinois Corp., said that in August he reduced his stake in First Illinois to 26.48% of the common shares outstanding. 
15/wsj_1538:As a result of the sales he holds 6,727,042 shares. 
15/wsj_1539:A lower court in St. Paul had ruled in September 1988 that a heart catheter SciMed manufactures doesn't infringe on a patent owned by Advanced Cardiovascular Systems, a unit of Eli Lilly & Co. 
15/wsj_1539:SciMed said it "remains committed" both to the "vigorous defense" of its position that the catheter doesn't infringe the Lilly unit's patent, and to the pursuit of its own counterclaims, which allege Lilly engaged in antitrust violations and other wrongful acts. 
15/wsj_1540:The new proposal, which would transfer majority ownership of United Air's parent to employees and leave some stock in public hands, would be valued at $225 to $240 a share, or as much as $5.42 billion.
15/wsj_1540:Takeover stock speculators have incurred paper losses of over $700 million from the failed UAL offer, their worst loss ever on a single deal.

15/wsj_1541:Inmac Corp., a money-losing direct marketer of computer supplies and accessories, said directors suspended payment of its semiannual dividend as too great a drain on funds. 
15/wsj_1541:Inmac recently disclosed a $12.3 million write-off related to a corporate restructuring that resulted in the company's posting a $6.4 million net loss for the year ended July 29, compared with year-earlier profit of $9.7 million, or $1.02 a share.
15/wsj_1541:"The board felt that the continued payment of our semiannual dividend was inconsistent with recent operating results," said Kenneth A. Eldred, president and chief executive officer. 
15/wsj_1542:The FDA requested the recall of Quantum's mioxidil tablets, chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because, it said, the size of the production runs submitted for testing to gain FDA approval was in each case misrepresented as much larger than it actually was. 
15/wsj_1542:American Home Products, based in New York, agreed to recall four other products, trazadone, doxepin, diazepam and lorazapam, because of concerns about data submitted in their original approval applications before the FDA. 
15/wsj_1542:Last month, American Home Products said it was suspending production and distribution of all 21 of Quantum's generic drug products pending the completion of an exhaustive internal audit.
15/wsj_1542:It also temporarily closed Quantum, because of the internal investigation, as well as the FDA's ongoing inquiry. 
15/wsj_1543:The petrochemical maker said the biggest reason earnings declined was a loss of production time and the increased costs associated with a temporary maintenance closing and expansion of an olefins plant. 
15/wsj_1544:Four former Cordis Corp. officials were acquitted of federal charges related to the Miami-based company's sale of pacemakers, including conspiracy to hide pacemaker defects. 
15/wsj_1544:Earlier this year, Cordis, a maker of medical devices, agreed to plead guilty to felony and misdemeanor charges related to the pacemakers and to pay the government about $5.7 million in fines and other costs.
15/wsj_1544:Cordis sold its pacemaker operations two years ago to Telectronics Holding Ltd. of Australia. 
15/wsj_1545:PAPERS: Management and unions representing 2,400 employees at Torstar Corp. 's Toronto Star reached a tentative contract agreement Friday, averting a strike by most employees of Canada's largest daily newspaper.
15/wsj_1545:Members of the largest union, representing 1,700 workers, voted in favor of the pact yesterday.
15/wsj_1545:The pact proposes a 2 1/2-year contract with a raise of 8% in the first year, 7% in the second and 4% for the final six months. 
15/wsj_1546:Amgen Inc. said its second-quarter earnings increased more than tenfold to $3.9 million, or 22 cents a share, due to increased sales of the company's new antianemia drug for kidney patients. 
15/wsj_1546:In the year-ago period, Amgen reported net income of $320,000, or two cents a share, on revenue of $21.5 million. 
15/wsj_1547:Lebanon's Parliament passed the power-sharing accord to end the country's 14-year-old conflict, but the Christian military leader wad the plan was "full of ambiguities." The Arab League-sponsored pact, drafted during three weeks of talks at the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif, includes Syrian proposals for at least a partial troop pullout from Lebanon, and guarantees an equal number of seats for Moslems and Christians in the Parliament. 
15/wsj_1547:The rejection by Aoun, who has demanded a total and immediate pull-out of Damascus's 33,000 troops, puts the future of the agreement in doubt. 
15/wsj_1547:As rescuers pressed their efforts after finding a survivor in a collapsed freeway, the San Francisco Bay area girded for hundreds of thousands of commuters seeking to avoid routes ravaged by last Tuesday's tremor.
15/wsj_1547:Estimates of damage in the area, visited Friday by Bush, topped $5 billion. 
15/wsj_1547:The baseball commissioner announced that the third game of the World Series between the Giants and the Athletics wouldn't resume until Friday.

15/wsj_1547:Under guidelines included in an exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence panel last year, the U.S. must inform foreign dictators of plans likely to endanger their lives.
15/wsj_1547:The existence of the policy became known after Bush disclosed it to seven GOP senators last week, citing the plan as an example of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of covert actions, officials said. 
15/wsj_1547:Despite the pledge by the Communist rulers, tens of thousands of people across the country staged marches over the weekend to demand democratic freedoms.
15/wsj_1547:The Senate convicted federal Judge Alcee Hastings of Miami of eight impeachment articles, removing him from the bench.
15/wsj_1547:The chamber voted 69-26 Friday to convict the judge of perjury and bribery conspiracy.

15/wsj_1549:"You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes," says an East German mother of two who loves swapping political barbs with her friends. "With Krenz, we just don't know what to expect." Mr. Krenz doesn't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old Politburo member was selected last week to succeed Erich Honecker.
15/wsj_1549:On Thursday, a day after he took office, East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer.
15/wsj_1549:The regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet-style glasnost. 
15/wsj_1549:But whether such moves can win back the confidence of East Germans, who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes, depends largely on whether they feel they can trust Mr. Krenz. 
15/wsj_1549:Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany's conservative vein of communism, there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades.
15/wsj_1549:Indeed, one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev.
15/wsj_1549:At one point, he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies.
15/wsj_1549:This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring.
15/wsj_1549:Rather than trying to "lecture us," says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting, Mr. Krenz "wanted to listen." Rep. Ronnie Flippo (D., Ala.), one of the members of the delegation, says he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz's ready admission that East Germany needed to change. 
15/wsj_1549:Born in a Baltic town in an area which is now part of Poland, he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus.
15/wsj_1549:He moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron, Mr. Honecker, and emerged as the heir apparent. 
15/wsj_1549:The sudden growth of the opposition movement, together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary, has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers' uprising in 1953. 
15/wsj_1549:And his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image, contrasting with the perception of Mr. Honecker as an out-of-touch old man. 
15/wsj_1549:The doctor was among dozens of people milling through East Berlin's Gethsemane Church Saturday morning.
15/wsj_1549:The walls of the church are covered with leaflets, news clippings, and handwritten notes associated with the country's political opposition. "I have to come here to read the walls," says the doctor, "because it's information I still can't get through the newspapers." 
15/wsj_1549:Meanwhile, East Germany's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor.
15/wsj_1550:The list of laboratories claiming to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from "cold fusion" experiments is slowly growing. 
15/wsj_1550:But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms.
15/wsj_1550:New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions, leaving only the finding of tritium in a Texas experiment to support University of Utah chemists' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures. 
15/wsj_1550:The latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in 24 reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the Electrochemical Society, the first scientific meeting in five months to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments. 
15/wsj_1550:The meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research.
15/wsj_1550:Of the 1,300 chemists registered for the society's weeklong meeting, fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week's end.
15/wsj_1550:This was in contrast with the society's meeting last May, at the height of the controversy, when more than 1,500 scientists, along with scores of reporters and TV crews, crowded into a Los Angeles hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject. 
15/wsj_1550:Neither of the two chemists whose Utah experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar, Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons, were at the meeting.
15/wsj_1550:But some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the Department of Energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience.
15/wsj_1550:The committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether DOE should support cold fusion research. 
15/wsj_1550:Most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new, more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs.
15/wsj_1550:The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into "heavy" water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium.
15/wsj_1550:Ordinarily the electrolysis, or breakup, of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy.
15/wsj_1550:Fleischmann and Pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat.
15/wsj_1550:The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in, they reported.
15/wsj_1550:Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation, they asserted that the "excess" heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod. 
15/wsj_1550:As of last weekend, a dozen labs also have reported measuring "excess" heat from similar electrolytic experiments, although amounts of such heat vary widely.
15/wsj_1550:One of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by Richard A. Oriani, professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota. 
15/wsj_1550:Mr. Oriani said his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results.
15/wsj_1550:Typical of other experiments, Mr. Oriani said his experiment was "very erratic." It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times, it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down.
15/wsj_1550:The excess heat was 15% to 20% more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water. 
15/wsj_1550:Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments' quiescent times, as some scientists have suggested. "There is a reality to the excess energy," he said. 
15/wsj_1550:Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time.
15/wsj_1550:The bursts often occur, they said, after they "perturbed" the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied, or switching the current off and on.
15/wsj_1550:Typically, the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt.
15/wsj_1550:One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells.
15/wsj_1550:A cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it, reported Turgut M. Gur, an associate of materials scientist Robert A. Huggins, head of the Stanford experimental team. 
15/wsj_1550:One of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist John Bockris of Texas A&M University.
15/wsj_1550:Mr. Bockris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water.
15/wsj_1550:He said that within the past few days, he's gotten evidence that there is a "weak correlation" between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium.
15/wsj_1550:There isn't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water, so it's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon. 
15/wsj_1550:Increasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons, which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions, continue to be negative.
15/wsj_1550:Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable.
15/wsj_1550:Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., reported they went so far as to take a "cold fusion" experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays.
15/wsj_1550:A number of times they detected neutrons in one, sometimes two, of the three detectors, but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event. 
15/wsj_1550:Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it.
15/wsj_1550:In subsequent experiments, one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time.
15/wsj_1550:They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment. 
15/wsj_1550:At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California, new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs.
15/wsj_1551:"Newsprint and postage prices this year have not gone up," said Peter R. Kann, president of Dow Jones. "We have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without substantially increasing our costs.
15/wsj_1551:Fundamental fairness and a sense of responsibility lead us to share operating efficiencies with our customers." 
15/wsj_1551:It owns 67% of Telerate Inc., a leading supplier of computerized financial information on global markets. 
15/wsj_1552:Reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending, Texas Instruments Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 31% and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier. 
15/wsj_1552:For the nine months, the electronics and defense concern had net of $255.8 million, or $2.70 a share, down 5.6% from $271 million, or $3.01 a share, in the year-ago period.
15/wsj_1552:In addition, cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a $10 million charge to reduce the work force of Texas Instruments' defense-electronics division also reduced net. 
15/wsj_1552:The nine months include $125 million of royalty income, up from $98 million last year. 
15/wsj_1553:Lynch Corp. said its Lynch Telephone Corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of Western New Mexico Telephone Co. for $20 million plus assumption of $24 million of debt. 
15/wsj_1553:Western New Mexico Telephone, Silver City, had net income of $1.9 million on revenue of about $10 million last year.
15/wsj_1553:It is an independent phone company with a service area of 15,000 square miles in southwest New Mexico.
15/wsj_1553:It is also a partner in the wireline cellular franchise covering most of western New Mexico. 
15/wsj_1554:Silver, now trading around $5 an ounce, surged to an all-time peak of $50 an ounce in January 1980 from around $9 in mid-1979. 
15/wsj_1554:Hunt's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today's market depression," says Lesley Edgar, managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd., London bullion brokers.
15/wsj_1554:While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates aren't hanging over the market anymore, the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use, Mr. Edgar says. 
15/wsj_1554:Meanwhile, the photographic industry, which accounts for 44% of silver consumption, continues to look for substitutes.
15/wsj_1554:Silver's history of volatility is also discouraging investors, dealers say.
15/wsj_1554:Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar, precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation, dealers say. 
15/wsj_1554:Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver, while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union.
15/wsj_1554:Japanese demand grew by 70% in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces. 
15/wsj_1554:Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s, world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance, Mr. Demler says. 
15/wsj_1554:A huge silver stockpile at exchanges, refiners, consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant, says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report. 
15/wsj_1554:This year alone, inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped "by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces" because of producer deliveries, de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors, says Rhona O'Connell, London-based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
15/wsj_1554:Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold, says Urs Seiler, senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland.
15/wsj_1554:Analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found fewer-than-expected cattle on feedlots. 
15/wsj_1554:After the close of trading Friday, the Agriculture Department reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8.06 million cattle on Oct. 1, down 6% from that date a year earlier. 
15/wsj_1554:Feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter, so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef. 
15/wsj_1554:The government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5% compared with the year-earlier quarter.
15/wsj_1554:The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable.
15/wsj_1554:A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy. 
15/wsj_1554:The Agriculture Department also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered in the quarter dropped by 5% from the 1988 quarter, which was in line with projections by analysts. 
15/wsj_1554:Pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes.
15/wsj_1554:In Mexico, the analyst added, employees at the Cananea mine, who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government, accepted a 35% cut in the 3,800-man work force.
15/wsj_1554:The premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed, indicating weaker demand for cash copper. 
15/wsj_1554:A technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract's price fell below it.
15/wsj_1554:That brought in considerable fund selling, which continued until the close of trading. "In general, it was a bearish close," said Ben Hanauer, a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co., a major commodities trading and brokerage firm.
15/wsj_1554:Bernard Savaiko, senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said that when traders saw the market wasn't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks, they perceived a bearish sign.
15/wsj_1554:Mr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to $1.05 a pound. 
15/wsj_1555:Called Task Broker, the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together.
15/wsj_1555:The new Hewlett-Packard program, said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc., a computer-market research company, "is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing." In today's computer networks, some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed.
15/wsj_1555:The program now works on all Hewlett-Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford, Conn.
15/wsj_1555:Applications won't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker, Hewlett-Packard said, and the user of a computer won't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work.
15/wsj_1555:The Task Broker "turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned -- one giant computer," said Bill Kay, general manager of Hewlett-Packard's workstation group. 
15/wsj_1556:"When elephants start fighting, ants get killed," says Murray Riese, co-owner of National Restaurants, a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut, Roy Rogers and other chains. 
15/wsj_1556:The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many, threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees. 
15/wsj_1556:The chains "used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow, but in the last year or so, discounting has become a 12-month thing," says Donald Harty, president of Charisma Group Inc., a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC's Burger King chain.
15/wsj_1556:And Bill Konopnicki, a Safford, Ariz., licensee of McDonald's Corp. who is chairman of the company's National Operators Advisory Board, says some fast-food outlets "could be in serious trouble, based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on." 
15/wsj_1556:Until recently, the huge fast-food industry, with sales of about $60.1 billion last year, kept price-skirmishing to a minimum.
15/wsj_1556:Alan D'Agosto, president of Panda's Inc., an operator of Arby's restaurants in Omaha, says: "All we're doing is keeping the customers coming, but we aren't increasing sales." With fast-food outlets on every corner, he, like many, doesn't think he has a choice in the price war: "Our customers say that they won't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon." 
15/wsj_1556:If the battle continues much longer, many fast-food businesses will close or merge, predicts Vincent Morrissey, who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest. "The industry is overbuilt," he says. "Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available." 
15/wsj_1556:Jack Greenberg, executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald's, says the company doesn't compute, much less disclose, inflation-adjusted, same-store sales.
15/wsj_1556:He adds that short-term comparisons "can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year." 
15/wsj_1556:Profits of franchisees haven't been higher since the mid-1970s, he adds. 
15/wsj_1556:Mr. Morrissey, the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee, notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties, or portion of sales, that they must pay franchisers. 
15/wsj_1556:But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program, the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end, says Lew Rudnick, a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe, a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients.
15/wsj_1556:Says Mr. Riese of National Restaurants: "If you resisted on prices, maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise." 
15/wsj_1557:Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
15/wsj_1558:Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
15/wsj_1559:CalMat Co. said it completed a $32.8 million sale of assets from its Los Angeles area real estate portfolio for net income of $12 million. 
15/wsj_1559:CalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt, concrete, rock and sand. 
15/wsj_1560:October" for his World Series exploits, is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $500 each. 
15/wsj_1560:Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. Jackson's canceled checks is unusual. "I don't know of any living ballplayer that's ever done it," says Jack Smalling, a dealer in Ames, Iowa, and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs. 
15/wsj_1560:An initial batch of Mr. Jackson's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend.
15/wsj_1560:"For someone who has everything else -- Reggie's jersey, cap and cards -- his checks might be a nice addition," says William Vizas, owner of Bill's Sports Collectibles in Denver, who examined the checks at the San Francisco card show. 
15/wsj_1560:For years, the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold.
15/wsj_1560:But these players were dead. "Maybe three years ago, there were a lot of {Ty} Cobbs in the hobby, and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks," says Mr. Smalling. 
15/wsj_1560:However, the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way. "Maybe I'm a little stuffy, but I wouldn't sell them," sniffs Bob Machon, owner of Papa's Sports Cards in Menlo Park, Calif. "Who knows how much they'll be worth 100 years from now?" 
15/wsj_1560:Why Mr. Jackson, who couldn't be reached for comment, has made some of his checks available for sale isn't clear.
15/wsj_1560:"I would say he's definitely not in need of money," says Matt Merola, an agent of Mr. Jackson's based in New York. "He has good investments." 
15/wsj_1560:Or at least he should. "I assume those accounts are closed," says Mr. Smalling, referring to the accounts of the canceled checks. "I don't think he'd want to give out his current account numbers." 
15/wsj_1561:Terms weren't disclosed for the plant, which will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons. 
15/wsj_1561:The move by the nation's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies.
15/wsj_1561:They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992, when the current import trade restraint program ends, which could result in more imports. 
15/wsj_1561:"There's too much capacity," contended Charles Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. "I don't think there's anyone not building one." He does add, however, that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos, instead of relying heavily on imported steel.
15/wsj_1561:The hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market, coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills -- those spun off to employees. 
15/wsj_1561:For the first eight months of 1989, analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8% from a year earlier, while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4%. 
15/wsj_1561:USX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year, with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992. 
15/wsj_1561:Moreover, it will boost by 50% USX's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons. 
15/wsj_1561:Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel, which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel.
15/wsj_1561:One of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly. 
15/wsj_1562:There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you don't know what you're doing. 
15/wsj_1562:So here's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges.
15/wsj_1562:Two things to keep in mind: Not all exchanges accept every type of order.
15/wsj_1562:Unless the market goes at least one tick (the smallest price increment permitted) beyond the limit price, investors aren't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price. 
15/wsj_1562:Investors who wish to be out of a position, without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order, may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled.
15/wsj_1562:Fill-Or-Kill Order: The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades.
15/wsj_1562:Gregory Bessemer, who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship, says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options. "I like to use them to feel out the market," he says. "If they don't fill it immediately, then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price." 
15/wsj_1562:Specific-Time Order: This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time. "On the close" can be added to many types of orders.
15/wsj_1562:For example, "market-on-close orders" must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange. "Stop-close-only orders" are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading. "Day orders" expire at the end of the day on which they are entered, "good-till-canceled orders" have no expiration date.
15/wsj_1562:On Oct. 19, 1987, some investors learned the consequences of entering "good-til-canceled limit orders" and then forgetting about them.
15/wsj_1562:It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed.
15/wsj_1563:IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments, there's probably no starting place better than "beta." But investors better not ignore its limitations, either. 
15/wsj_1563:Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund.
15/wsj_1563:The beta of the broad market, typically defined as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, is always 1.0.
15/wsj_1563:So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile, one at 1.5 is 50% more volatile, and so on. 
15/wsj_1563:Remember, though, that beta also has important limitations. "Beta is only part of the risk in a stock," says William F. Sharpe, the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure. "There is risk that is not associated with market moves, and the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that." 
15/wsj_1563:Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer.
15/wsj_1563:In particular, the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down, but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired. 
15/wsj_1563:Concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the American Association of Individual Investors to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual-fund guide. 
15/wsj_1563:"Our fear was people would look just at the beta {of a gold fund} and say here is an investment with very low risk," says John Markese, director of research for the Chicago-based group. "In reality it's very volatile, but the movements are not because of market movements." 
15/wsj_1564:READY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio? 
15/wsj_1564:When you think of the words "risk" and "investment," what's the specific peril that comes to mind? 
15/wsj_1564:"People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension," says Timothy Kochis, national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte, Haskins & Sells. 
15/wsj_1564:But therein lies another aspect of investment risk: the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others. 
15/wsj_1564:This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night, lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs.
15/wsj_1564:Risk wears many disguises, and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other, less obvious kinds.
15/wsj_1564:But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of bonds' fixed-dollar interest payments. 
15/wsj_1564:Risk is also a function of time. 
15/wsj_1564:When financial professionals measure risk mathematically, they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns.
15/wsj_1564:That is usually measured by the standard deviation, or divergence, of annual results from the average return over time. 
15/wsj_1564:By retreating to the apparent security of, say, money-market funds, investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement. 
15/wsj_1564:"That's the biggest risk of all -- the risk of not meeting your objectives," says Steven B. Enright, a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services. 
15/wsj_1564:As a result, financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients' portfolios. 
15/wsj_1564:And they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified. 
15/wsj_1564:The portfolios of two hypothetical families, one a couple at retirement age and another a two-income couple at age 45, illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider.
15/wsj_1564:But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk. 
15/wsj_1564:The younger couple's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue. 
15/wsj_1564:Note that the younger couple's portfolio has a higher expected annual return, 10.1% vs. 8.8%, as calculated by Seidman Financial Services, which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman.
15/wsj_1564:In two of three years, the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate.
15/wsj_1564:Of course, the greater volatility of the younger couple's portfolio doesn't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders' long-term goals.
15/wsj_1564:Over several decades, for instance, investors who put up with the stock market's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and "cash" investments like Treasury bills. 
15/wsj_1564:For instance, some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market.
15/wsj_1565:He correctly says he has been down on Noriega for some time, hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup. 
15/wsj_1565:It meant to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega to include other notorious Central American drug runners.
15/wsj_1565:The Sandinistas of Nicaragua, for example, also are part of the Castro-Medellin cartel nexus.
15/wsj_1565:In his letter and on the basis of his losing vote Tuesday against U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan opposition, Senator Kerry makes clear he has not made that intellectual leap.
15/wsj_1566:THROUGHOUT THE 1980s, investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning.
15/wsj_1566:Too often, however, small investors are left with the same stale solutions that appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists. 
15/wsj_1566:Now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk, without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit! This is particularly good news for those who hate risk, who are incapable of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way.
15/wsj_1566:My revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion.
15/wsj_1566:So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs, and tinkered with stocks, bonds and mutual funds, as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market.
15/wsj_1566:Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I've invested in during this prosperous decade (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 20, 1989).
15/wsj_1566:Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985, at which point the industry, while not lighting up any Christmas trees, began a slow recovery. 
15/wsj_1566:By 1987, these properties were in a tailspin, causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she'd "never seen anything like it." Concerned for her state of mind, I dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health.
15/wsj_1566:Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market, which was booming until I entered it in late 1988, at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years. 
15/wsj_1566:Disgusted, I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution, and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me: I was doing it already! We've all got money to spend, some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it.
15/wsj_1566:Your priorities may be different, but here in Figure 2 is where I've chosen to build for the future: personal space; automotive pursuits; children's toys; gardening equipment, bulbs and shrubs; and finally, entertainment, perhaps the best investment of all.
15/wsj_1566:Personal space (Figure 3) has grown 35% annually over the course of the decade, a performance that would compare positively with an investment in, say, synthetic-leather products for the interiors of cold-weather vehicles, which my cousin got into and sort of regrets to this day. 
15/wsj_1566:The assortment of expensive children's toys that I have purchased wisely at a host of discount-toy brokerage firms (Figure 4) has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except, perhaps, for my record collection, whose worth, I think it's safe to say, is incalculable. 
15/wsj_1566:Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy (Figure 5), with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60% of the car's original value.
15/wsj_1566:According to my calculations, these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $22,000 on the open market (Figure 6), where I plan to offer it shortly. 
15/wsj_1566:Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns, shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale.
15/wsj_1566:I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers.
15/wsj_1566:At the same time, my share in a wide variety of entertainment pursuits has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning.
15/wsj_1566:Over the course of the decade, for instance, my return on investment in the area of poker alone (Figures 7A and 7B) has been most impressive, showing bodacious annual expansion with -- given the way my associates play -- no sign of abatement into the 1990s and beyond. 
15/wsj_1566:With this personal strategy firmly in place, I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage.
15/wsj_1566:My kids' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending, although I'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it.
15/wsj_1566:You're right there in the mainstream of American business, building value on the back of insupportable expenditures.
15/wsj_1567:WHEN JAMES SCHWARTZ was just a lad his father gave him a piece of career advice. "He told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre I could be great," recalls Mr. Schwartz, now 40.
15/wsj_1567:It should be noted that Mr. Schwartz, who operates out of Englewood, Colo., is a puckish sort who likes to give his colleagues the needle.
15/wsj_1567:Though it's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent, the fact remains that, as one wag puts it, "anybody who can fog a mirror" can call himself a financial planner. 
15/wsj_1567:Planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars, but in effect they operate in the dark.
15/wsj_1567:There is no effective regulation of planners, no accepted standard for admission into their ranks -- a dog got into one trade group -- no way to assess their performance, no way even to know how many of them there are (estimates range from 60,000 to 450,000).
15/wsj_1567:So it should come as no shock that the profession, if that's what it is, has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients' money.
15/wsj_1567:Industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards, too; they're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine. 
15/wsj_1567:But reform hasn't taken hold yet. "The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days," says Scott Stapf, director of investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Association. 
15/wsj_1567:The rogues' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons, a compulsive gambler or two, various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy, and one man who scammed his wife's grandmother.
15/wsj_1567:What's more, the losses they and the others caused "are just what we are stumbling over," says Mr. Stapf, adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected. 
15/wsj_1567:So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners.
15/wsj_1567:Nobody can estimate the toll, but John Gargan, a Tampa, Fla., planner and head of one trade group, the International Association of Registered Financial Planners, thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is "humongous," far greater than that from crookery.
15/wsj_1567:For most investors "the benefits just aren't worth the risks," says Barbara Roper, who follows financial-planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer-advocacy organization based in Washington. 
15/wsj_1567:She concedes that such a position is "unfair" to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade, but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it.
15/wsj_1567:The Tax Reform Act of 1986, which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners, and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand, and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business.
15/wsj_1567:But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners (IAFP), the industry's biggest trade group, is still nearly triple what it was in 1980, and it's believed that the ranks of planners who don't belong to any group have soared as well. 
15/wsj_1567:An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners, and the pool of capital they influence is enormous.
15/wsj_1567:A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $154 billion of their clients' money in the previous 12 months. 
15/wsj_1567:The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult, if not impossible, to regulate.
15/wsj_1567:Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as "investment advisers" -- people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically -- have been enough to swamp the agency's capacity.
15/wsj_1567:The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade.
15/wsj_1567:A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years. "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem," says Kathryn McGrath, director of the SEC's division of investment management. 
15/wsj_1567:So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded, self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates in the brokerage business.
15/wsj_1567:Mr. Schwartz, the puckish planner from Englewood, Colo., says that allowing the business to police itself would be "like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank." Mr. Gargan, the Tampa planner who heads one trade group, favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff. 
15/wsj_1567:That may be because Mr. Gargan, smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group, enrolled his dog, Beauregard, as a member of the IAFP. Then he sent the pooch's picture with the certificate of membership -- it was made out to "Boris `Bo' Regaard" -- to every newspaper he could think of.) 
15/wsj_1567:NASAA, the organization of state securities regulators, is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states.
15/wsj_1567:It requires financial planners to register with states, pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest. 
15/wsj_1567:NASAA estimates that nearly 90% of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities, insurance and other financial products they recommend.
15/wsj_1567:In 1986 the New York attorney general's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp., an Albany financial-planning firm that had invested $55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors.
15/wsj_1567:In its notice of action, the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into "balanced" investment portfolios; instead, the attorney general alleged, the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings, coins and Florida condos.
15/wsj_1567:In practice, the attorney general alleged in an affidavit, if an investor had access to cash "the chances of being turned down by First Meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month Club." 
15/wsj_1567:And, the attorney general added, First Meridian's president, Roger V. Sala, portrayed himself as a "financial expert" when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma, work as a real-estate and insurance salesman, and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth.
15/wsj_1567:As for Mr. Sala's qualifications, "the snooty attorneys for the state of New York decided Mr. Sala wasn't qualified because he didn't have a Harvard degree," says Mr. Manion. 
15/wsj_1567:Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common.
15/wsj_1567:Two such actions, both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta, could be particularly embarrassing to the industry: both name J. Chandler Peterson, an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP, as defendant. 
15/wsj_1567:One suit, filed by more than three dozen investors, charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted, spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest.
15/wsj_1567:The other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale, Ariz.
15/wsj_1567:One plaintiff, a doctor, testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson $50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician "the privilege of making additional investments" with Mr. Peterson. 
15/wsj_1567:In affidavits, each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned.
15/wsj_1567:Mr. Peterson took the plaintiffs' and other investors' money to a meeting of the bank's directors. 
15/wsj_1567:Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots, he opened up his briefcase and dumped $1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors, says Myron Diebel, the bank's president. "He said he wanted to show the color of his money," recalls Mr. Diebel. 
15/wsj_1567:But he does say that all of his activities have been "entirely proper." 
15/wsj_1567:The suit, he adds, "is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people." 
15/wsj_1567:Mr. Peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a "sign of the times" in which people generally are more prone to sue. "I don't know anybody in the industry who hasn't experienced litigation," he says. 
15/wsj_1567:In many scams or alleged scams involving planners, it's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm's way.
15/wsj_1567:Using it, wouldn't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner? 
15/wsj_1567:Certificates of deposit don't pay 23% a year, for example, but that didn't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner.
15/wsj_1567:And the Colorado planner who promised to make some of his clients millionaires on investments of as litle as $100?
15/wsj_1568:At the ritzy Fashion Island Shopping Center, the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy Southern California beach community disembark from their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs for another day of exercising their credit cards. 
15/wsj_1568:They stroll through the marble-encased corridors of the Atrium Court.
15/wsj_1568:They graze at the Farmers Market, a combination gourmet food court and grocery store, while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies. "The beautiful look of wool," croons the show's narrator, "slightly Victorian in its influence...." 
15/wsj_1568:Law-enforcement authorities say that at any given time, a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here. "They seem to like these industrial parks," says Kacy McClelland, a postal inspector who specializes in mail fraud. "We call them fraud farms." 
15/wsj_1568:Welcome to that welter of contradictions known as Newport Beach.
15/wsj_1568:This city of more than 70,000 is known for sunshine, yachts and rich residents.
15/wsj_1568:It is also known as the fraud capital of the U.S., dubbed by investigators and the media as the "Cote de Fraud". 
15/wsj_1568:Clearly, the existence of the former lures the latter. 
15/wsj_1568:The places renowned for breeding bunco, like the Miami neighborhood known as the "Maggot Mile" and Las Vegas's flashy strip of casinos, invariably offer fast cars, high rollers, glamorous women and lots of sunshine.
15/wsj_1568:You don't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in Green Bay or Buffalo.
15/wsj_1568:What more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for?
15/wsj_1568:The median price of homes is $547,000; more than 9,000 vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation's largest pleasure-boat harbor. "Blondes, cocaine and Corvettes," mutters Mr. McClelland. "That's what they're after." 
15/wsj_1568:The rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists' operation an air of respectability. "One reason they use Newport Beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses," says David Katz, a U.S. attorney who, until recently, headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force. "Newport Beach is known in Rhode Island for having a lot of rich people." 
15/wsj_1568:No wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here, from phony tax-sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders.
15/wsj_1568:Because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted, nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest. "I've heard that there is $40 billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year," Mr. McClelland says. "If that's true, Orange County has to be at least 10% of that." 
15/wsj_1568:And most of the truly big scams in Orange County seem to originate in Newport Beach or one of the other well-heeled communities that surround this sliver-like city that hooks around a point of land on the California coast south of Los Angeles. 
15/wsj_1568:That contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as "Hollywood" scams. 
15/wsj_1568:Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot.
15/wsj_1568:In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room, prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses "caused by employees due to dishonesty, destruction or disappearance," according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month.
15/wsj_1568:Thus falsely reassured, investors sent $11.4 million to the Newport Beach company, most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses, the indictment charges. 
15/wsj_1568:Douglas Jones, an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr., the chairman and president of Capital Trust, says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors. "There were some business deals that went bad," Mr. Jones says, "but no intent to defraud." Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars.
15/wsj_1568:But, says Mr. Katz, the U.S. attorney, "the interesting thing about Newport Beach operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices, with plush furnishings.
15/wsj_1568:Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine, who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp., which promised investors returns of as much as 625% on precious metals.
15/wsj_1568:Mr. Valentine, who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles, drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle, an island in Newport's harbor, according to investigators.
15/wsj_1568:With the $3 million received from investors, he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend, whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits. "It's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose, out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas," Mr. Katz says. 
15/wsj_1568:All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city's legitimate business element.
15/wsj_1568:Vincent M Ciavarella, regional manager of Property Management Systems, insists he doesn't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co., the owner and developer of the project.
15/wsj_1568:Richard Luehrs, president of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce, calls boiler rooms a "negative we wish we could get rid of." Actually, "we don't get much negative publicity about this," he insists, "except for the press who write about it." 
15/wsj_1568:Mr. Lancaster is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal's Dallas bureau. 
15/wsj_1569:Now, investment salesmen say it's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your toddler a ticket to Prestige U. in 18 years. 
15/wsj_1569:Nothing in the annals of tuition readied parents for the 1980s.
15/wsj_1569:Tuitions at private colleges rose 154% in the 10 years ended in June of this year; that's twice the 77% increase in consumer prices for the same period. 
15/wsj_1569:"You're not going to make it in a 5% bank account," says James Riepe, director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price.
15/wsj_1569:The antitrust division of the Justice Department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools.
15/wsj_1569:Fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s. 
15/wsj_1569:Belatedly aware of public concern, lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes. 
15/wsj_1569:The latest wave of marketing is instructive.
15/wsj_1569:The calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of 8% annually -- a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one place, the stock market. 
15/wsj_1569:Most of the mailers are free, but Denver-based Financial Programs sells, for $15, a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice.
15/wsj_1569:Using a recent average private-school cost of about $12,500 a year, T. Rowe Price's planner prescribes $450 monthly if the plan begins when the child is six.
15/wsj_1569:Not everyone is so pessimistic. "People are basically peddling a lot of fear," says Arthur Hauptman, a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington.
15/wsj_1569:Still, he says, "it's no bad thing" if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more. "The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they'll be able to do it out of current income," he says. "That's crazy." 
15/wsj_1569:But Richard Anderson, head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives, at Columbia University, a research group partly financed by the federal government, says zeros are particularly ill-suited.
15/wsj_1569:Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up.
15/wsj_1569:That won't matter if they are held to maturity, but if, for any reason, the parents need to sell them before then, there could be a severe loss of principal. 
15/wsj_1569:The prepaid plans may be a good bet, provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure.
15/wsj_1569:The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee.
15/wsj_1569:Sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns.
15/wsj_1569:One problem is that the Internal Revenue Service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors' funds are taxable.
15/wsj_1569:Based on historical rates of return, Mr. Anderson reckons a 100% stock portfolio, indexed to the market, would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century.
15/wsj_1569:Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments, meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack.
15/wsj_1569:If you start saving for your child's eduction on Jan. 1, 1990, here's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at Yale, Notre Dame and University of Minnesota.
15/wsj_1570:AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County, Miss., Allen D. Tharp of Isola was one of the best known and most enterprising. 
15/wsj_1570:Along the way, Mr. Tharp omitted a total of $1.5 million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years.
15/wsj_1570:The returns landed in the hands of an Internal Revenue Service criminal investigator, Samuel James Baker.
15/wsj_1570:Mr. Baker interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers, live-haulers and processors throughout the South before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales, in pounds and dollars, by Mr. Tharp and others. 
15/wsj_1570:Confronted with the evidence, Mr. Tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined $5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison.
15/wsj_1570:He also owes a lot of back taxes, interest and civil fraud penalties. 
15/wsj_1570:A lot of taxpayers out there aren't as paranoid as one might think.
15/wsj_1570:Federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation, on the basis of occupation, high income, type of income, or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or exaggerate deductions. 
15/wsj_1570:Many professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters: dentists who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised racehorses on their days off.
15/wsj_1570:The IRS recently won part of its long-running battle with the Church of Scientology over exemptions when the U.S. Supreme Court held that members' payments to the church weren't deductible because the members received services in return. 
15/wsj_1570:IRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers, entertainment producers, masons, roofers, and taxi owners.
15/wsj_1570:Small businesses in general account for almost 40% of unreported personal income, the IRS has said. 
15/wsj_1570:San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula, not because IRS agents envy their life styles. 
15/wsj_1570:Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals.
15/wsj_1570:And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers. 
15/wsj_1570:Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony (who gets a deduction) must report the former spouse's Social Security number.
15/wsj_1570:In most cases, the IRS says, these projects are local or regional, rather than national, and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among, say, factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses. 
15/wsj_1570:Auditors involved in noncriminal projects can't send anyone to jail, but they can make life miserable in other ways -- for one, by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence, failure to file a return, and the like. 
15/wsj_1570:The targeted audit groups include direct sellers -- people who sell cosmetics, housewares and other items door to door or at home parties -- and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees, to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes. 
15/wsj_1570:Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips, people who engage in large cash transactions, and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year; the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax. 
15/wsj_1570:It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs, Mr. Washburn says.
15/wsj_1570:The study provided criteria for singling out returns of "potentially noncompliant" taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part-time business. 
15/wsj_1570:The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill, N.J., who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields.
15/wsj_1570:For 1984, they reported gross income of $1,647 from Amway sales, offset by expenses totaling $16,746 -- including car costs of $6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $5,088.
15/wsj_1570:The Tax Court didn't believe that the Rubins, who earned $65,619 in their regular jobs, treated the sideline as a real business and derived "merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits" from it. 
15/wsj_1570:In the fiscal nine months ended June 30, reports Raymond P. Keenan, assistant commissioner for collection, they examined about 13,000 employers, assessed more than $67 million in delinquent employment taxes, and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors. 
15/wsj_1570:The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions, mostly paid by small firms.
15/wsj_1570:But many others, who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation, become tipsters for the IRS, says Jerry Lackey, who manages the IRS project's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando.
15/wsj_1570:But a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them -- including physicians and receptionists -- as independent contractors.
15/wsj_1570:Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents, and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $80 million computer system in 1985.
15/wsj_1570:Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer, they single out high-income groups, looking primarily for people who haven't filed New York income-tax returns. 
15/wsj_1570:The state has combed through records relating to architects, stockbrokers, lawyers in the New York City area, construction workers from out of the state, and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida, which has no personal income tax.
15/wsj_1570:Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state, doctors, dentists, and accountants, says Frederick G. Hicks, director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs. 
15/wsj_1570:The department has collected over $6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution.
15/wsj_1570:In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $500,000 who were filing nonresident returns, it squeezed $7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident. "We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project," Mr. Hicks declares. 
15/wsj_1570:Mr. Schmedel is editor of The Wall Street Journal's Tax Report column. 
15/wsj_1571:The plan indeed raises from 40% to 50% the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria.
15/wsj_1571:But that doesn't mean "half of the students attending Berkeley" will be admitted this way.
15/wsj_1571:Since the "yield" from this top slice of applicants is relatively low, boosting admits from 40% to 50% will boost registrants from about 31% to 38% of the class. 
15/wsj_1571:In addition, perhaps 5% of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials "narrowly missed" gaining them admission in the first category. 
15/wsj_1571:But against that combined increase of 12% in students chosen by academic criteria, the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades, test scores and "supplemental points" for factors such as high-school curriculum, English-language proficiency and an essay.
15/wsj_1571:This category now accounts for about 19% of admits and 22% of registrants. 
15/wsj_1571:The plan thus will decrease by 22%, for a net loss of 10%, the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria. 
15/wsj_1571:The plan creates a new category of students from "socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds," a concept not yet defined, and gives them about 10% of the class. 
15/wsj_1571:One of the plan's authors has defended the "socioeconomic disadvantage" category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race.
15/wsj_1571:The plan thus places a large new affirmative-action program, based on "socioeconomic disadvantage," on top of the existing program based on race.
15/wsj_1571:The role of academic criteria in choosing Berkeley's freshmen can only decline as a result. 
15/wsj_1571:Professor of Law University of California 
15/wsj_1572:FOR THOSE WHO DELIGHT in the misfortune of others, read on.
15/wsj_1572:Most of us know a sucker.
15/wsj_1572:Many of us are suckers.
15/wsj_1572:What makes people blurt out their credit-card numbers to a caller they've never heard of?
15/wsj_1572:There are, unfortunately, plenty of answers to that question -- and scam artists know all of them. 
15/wsj_1572:"These people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person tick," says Kent Neal, chief of the economic-crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney's Office in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a major haven for boiler rooms. "Once they size them up, then they know what buttons to push." 
15/wsj_1572:He used to be a boiler-room salesman, peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins. "There's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways," he says. 
15/wsj_1572:The most obvious pitch, of course, is the lure of big returns. "We're all a little greedy.
15/wsj_1572:While the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells, they often don't, in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore. 
15/wsj_1572:"The overnight success story is part of our culture, and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people," says Michael Cunningham, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville. "Other people are making it overnight, and the rest who toil daily don't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along." 
15/wsj_1572:Clearly, though, scam artists have to be a bit more subtle than simply promising millions; the psychology of suckers isn't simply the psychology of the greedy.
15/wsj_1572:There's also, for instance, the need to be part of the in-crowd.
15/wsj_1572:Between 1978 and 1987, for instance, SH Oil in Winter Haven, Fla., sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents, while turning away numerous other eager investors.
15/wsj_1572:The owner of the company, Stephen Smith, who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges, confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential, according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller's office.
15/wsj_1572:Such schemes, says Tony Adamski, chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D.C., appeal to investors' "desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity." 
15/wsj_1572:In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts, the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others. 
15/wsj_1572:It also adds to the mystery of the venture.
15/wsj_1572:Mr. Blodgett, the boiler-room veteran, believes that for many investors, the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement. "Once people got into it, I was allowing them to live a dream," he says.
15/wsj_1572:Blodgett, who was convicted in Florida state court of selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive, is now on probation.
15/wsj_1572:For some investors, it's the appearances that leave them deceived. "The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes, doing the right things," says Paul Andreassen, an associate professor of psychology at Harvard.
15/wsj_1572:Paul Wenz, a Phoenix, Ariz., attorney, says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery.
15/wsj_1572:When he visited the company's office, he says, it had "all the trappings of legitimacy." 
15/wsj_1572:Still others are stung by a desire to do both well and good, says Douglas Watson, commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department's bunko-forgery division.
15/wsj_1572:Born-again Christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do-gooder investment pitches.
15/wsj_1572:But hardly the only ones: The scams promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment, feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children. 
15/wsj_1572:William Lynes, a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp., says he and his wife, Lily, warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from Stuart-James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them he, too, had once worked with Lockheed. 
15/wsj_1572:The Lyneses, of Powder Springs, Ga., have filed suit in Georgia state court against Stuart James, alleging fraud.
15/wsj_1572:"It's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to ingratiate themselves to their clients," says Terree Bowers, chief of the major-frauds section of the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. "We've seen cases where salesmen will affect the accent of the region of the country they are calling.
15/wsj_1572:People may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives. "Sometimes when people are making big changes, retiring from their jobs, moving to a new area, they lose their bearings," says Maury Elvekrog, a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger-Elvekrog Inc., a Birmingham, Mich., investment-counseling firm. "They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time." 
15/wsj_1572:Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way," says Jerald Jellison, a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. 
15/wsj_1574:FOX HUNTING HAS been defined as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible, but at least it's exercise.
15/wsj_1574:Most of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither, drab duties rather than pleasures.
15/wsj_1574:But sooner or later, most of us have to think about life insurance, just as we often have to think about having root-canal work.
15/wsj_1574:In times past, life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household, meaning men, but ours is a two-income family and accustomed to it.
15/wsj_1574:So if anything happened to me, I'd want to leave behind enough so that my 33-year-old husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts (though not, I admit, enough to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury). 
15/wsj_1574:Figuring that maybe $100,000 to $150,000 would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted, I looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies -- and plunged into a jungle of gibberish. 
15/wsj_1574:Over the past decade or two, while I was thinking about fox hunting, the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products, variations on products, and variations on the variations.
15/wsj_1574:Shorn of all their riders, special provisions, and other bells and whistles, insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories: so-called pure insurance, which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death, and permanent insurance, which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive. 
15/wsj_1574:There are all sorts of variations on term insurance: policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt, term riders tacked on to permanent insurance, and many others.
15/wsj_1574:Upon examination, however, I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense. 
15/wsj_1574:Amex said it would charge me $576 a year for $100,000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years.
15/wsj_1574:Second, the $5,760 I'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation; Amex, not I, would get the benefit of the investment income on my money, income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit. 
15/wsj_1574:Third and most important, Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount; I'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile.
15/wsj_1574:The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature. 
15/wsj_1574:That's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package.
15/wsj_1574:This is reflected in a built-in mortality cost -- in effect, your share of the company's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection.
15/wsj_1574:And in most cases, a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is, in effect, paying the salesman's commission as well; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years, largely because of this. 
15/wsj_1574:The simplest, most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy.
15/wsj_1574:You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage, the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing, and your cash value and dividends grow over the years. 
15/wsj_1574:One newer wrinkle, so called single-premium life (you pay for the whole policy at once), has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons; the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy "loans," and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment. 
15/wsj_1574:However, Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield, Mass., has developed a "combination plan" of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences.
15/wsj_1574:But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small. 
15/wsj_1574:I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year; and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy. 
15/wsj_1574:In looking at these and other policies, I learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into "policy illustrations" -- the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years.
15/wsj_1574:Also, some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year.
15/wsj_1574:Companies "aren't comfortable playing these games, but they realize they're under pressure to make their policies look good," says Timothy Pfiefer, an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast, a unit of Towers Perrin Co., the big New York consulting firm.
15/wsj_1574:Another factor to consider: Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds, and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately. 
15/wsj_1574:There are seemingly endless twists to universal life, and it pays to ask questions about all of them.
15/wsj_1574:Yes, he says, premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to "vanish" after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection.
15/wsj_1574:If interest rates plunge, the insurer may be knocking on my door, asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection.
15/wsj_1574:I don't like the sound of that. 
15/wsj_1574:But Glenn Daily, a New York-based financial consultant, warns that many of these bonuses are "just fantasies," because most aren't guaranteed by the companies.
15/wsj_1574:Offered by insurers that include Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co., Jackson National Life Insurance Co., and National Travelers Life Insurance Co., these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I'm still alive.
15/wsj_1574:Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer, heart attarcks, renal failure and kidney transplants. 
15/wsj_1574:But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined, vary from policy to policy, and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance.
15/wsj_1574:And considering the extra cost of such provisions, some figure that people interested in, say, paying for extended nursing-home care would be better off just buying a separate policy that provides it. 
15/wsj_1574:Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise don't use commissioned salesmen; there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial "setup" charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of "surrender fees" for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot. 
15/wsj_1574:I compared one universal policy for $130,000 face amount from such an insurer, American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln, Neb., with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen.
15/wsj_1575:His projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than $17.4 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with $15.2 million, or 48 cents a share, a year ago. 
15/wsj_1575:Mr. Cawthorn said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of "somewhat less than 10%." Through the first six months of 1989, sales had grown about 12% from the year-earlier period. 
15/wsj_1575:Growth of 10% would make sales for the latest quarter $269 million, compared with $244.6 million a year ago. 
15/wsj_1575:Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs.
15/wsj_1575:He said Rorer sold the drugs for "nice prices" and will record a combined, pretax gain on the sales of $20 million. 
15/wsj_1575:Rorer in July had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989.
15/wsj_1575:Mr. Cawthorn attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar, which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars; to accelerated buying of Rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending July 1 price increase, and to higher marketing expenses for Rorer's Maalox antacid, whose sales and market share in the U.S. had slipped in the first half of 1989.
15/wsj_1575:He said Rorer will spend $15 million to $20 million more on Maalox advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period.
15/wsj_1575:A "big chunk" of that additional spending came in the third quarter, he said. 
15/wsj_1576:Hoechst AG said it will stop producing fertilizer in 1990 because of continued losses and a bleak outlook. 
15/wsj_1576:The West German chemical concern said it will close the last remaining fertilizer plant in Oberhausen in the fall of next year. 
15/wsj_1577:The federal Office of Thrift Supervision approved the conversion last Friday, HomeFed said. 
15/wsj_1577:The change in charter doesn't alter the federal insurance of deposits, federal regulatory powers or company operations, a spokesman said. 
15/wsj_1578:It was the second anniversary of the 1987 crash, but this time it was different.
15/wsj_1578:Traders said a variety of factors triggered the rally.
15/wsj_1578:The euphoria was such that investors responded to good earnings reports of companies such as American Express, while ignoring the disappointing profits of companies such as Caterpillar, analysts said. 
15/wsj_1578:To the amazement of some traders, takeover stocks were climbing again.
15/wsj_1578:Last Friday, takeover traders spilled out of Hilton, knocking the stock down 21 1/2 to 85.
15/wsj_1578:The announcement of the buy-out's troubles triggered the market's nose dive a week ago. 
15/wsj_1578:Takeover enthusiasm may have been renewed when an investor group disclosed yesterday that it had obtained all the financing required to complete its $1.6 billion leveraged buy-out of American Medical International. "That's put some oomph back into this market," said Peter VandenBerg, a vice president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
15/wsj_1578:Indeed, many traders said that uncertainty about today's monthly expiration of stocks-index futures and options, and options on individual stocks, prompted a lot of buying by speculative traders who were unwinding positions that were bets on declining stock prices. 
15/wsj_1578:The number of outstanding contracts in the October Major Market Index jumped from 5,273 on Friday to 9,023 on Monday.
15/wsj_1578:By Wednesday, the outstanding October contracts amounted to 8,524, representing about $1.13 billion in stock, noted Donald Selkin, head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities, who expects a volatile expiration today. "There has been a tremendous increase" in MMI positions, Mr. Selkin said. 
15/wsj_1578:Philip Morris added 1 1/8 to 44 1/2 in Big Board composite trading of 3.7 million shares, Coca-Cola Co. gained 2 3/8 to 70 3/8, Merck gained 1 3/8 to 77 3/8 and American Telephone & Telegraph advanced 7/8 to 43 3/8 on 2.5 million shares. 
15/wsj_1578:IMA Acquisition, an investor group that includes First Boston and the Pritzker family of Chicago, said Chemical Bank had made arrangements for 23 other banks to provide $509 million in bank financing for the buy-out offer.
15/wsj_1578:Chemical and six other banks, along with First Boston, are providing the rest of the $1.6 billion. 
15/wsj_1578:Investor Robert M. Gintel, who owns a 4.7% stake in the company, said he plans a proxy fight for control of its board. 
15/wsj_1578:Its board approved the repurchase of as many as three million common shares, or about 17% of its shares outstanding. 
15/wsj_1578:Compaq Computer soared 4 5/8 to 111 1/8 on 1.8 million shares in response to the company's announcement of plans to introduce several products next month.
15/wsj_1578:Digital Equipment gained 1 3/8 to 89 3/4 despite reporting earnings for the September quarter that were on the low end of expectations. 
15/wsj_1578:Insurance stocks continued to climb on expectations that premium rates will rise in the aftermath of the earthquake in the San Francisco area.
15/wsj_1578:Stocks of major toy makers rallied in the wake of strong third-quarter earnings reports.
15/wsj_1578:Merrill Lynch lowered its short-term rating on the stock and its estimate of 1990 earnings, citing a sales slowdown in the company's credit-rating business. 
15/wsj_1578:The Amex Market Value Index recorded its sharpest gain of the year by climbing 4.74 to 382.81.
15/wsj_1578:The company said six officers are buying a total of $1.5 million of its stock. 
15/wsj_1578:TRC Cos., the target of an investigation by the U.S. inspector general, dropped 2 to 10 3/4.
15/wsj_1579:Avondale Industries Inc., New Orleans, received a $23 million contract from the Navy to enlarge by 50% the capacity of an auxiliary oiler. 
15/wsj_1579:The award results from the Navy's exercising of an option in an earlier contract it awarded Avondale. 
15/wsj_1580:Richard J. Pinola was elected to the board of this personnel consulting concern, increasing its size to nine members.
15/wsj_1580:Mr. Pinola is president and chief operating officer of Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co. 
15/wsj_1581:The 51-48 roll call fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve changes to the Constitution. 
15/wsj_1581:The vote, in which 11 GOP lawmakers voted against Mr. Bush's position, was a victory for Democratic leaders, who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights. "We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution," said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine. 
15/wsj_1581:In June, the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration, saying he was "engaging in political expression" that is protected by the First Amendment. 
15/wsj_1582:A new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health, found that a full 25% of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness, with about 13% suffering from depression. 
15/wsj_1582:The study surveyed a national group of medical directors, personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies.
15/wsj_1582:It is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the New York Business Group, a non-profit organization with about 300 members.
15/wsj_1582:The stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress "are much more prevalent than they seem," said Leon J. Warshaw, executive director of the business group. 
15/wsj_1582:In presenting the study late last week, Dr. Warshaw estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial.
15/wsj_1582:Occupational disability related to anxiety, depression and stress costs about $8,000 a case in terms of worker's compensation.
15/wsj_1582:In terms of days lost on the job, the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress, anxiety or depression. 
15/wsj_1582:Early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with hospitalization, which sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too long. 
15/wsj_1582:But although 56% of the respondents in the study indicated that mental-health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace, there is still a social stigma associated with people seeking help. 
15/wsj_1582:The disorders, which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people, "now strike people at the height of productivity," says Robert M.A. Hirschfeld, of the National Institute of Mental Health, who spoke at the presentation of the study's findings. 
15/wsj_1582:The poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager's view of the problem, with 65% of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying stress-related problems were "fairly pervasive" and 55% of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing. 
15/wsj_1582:The poll also noted fear of a takeover as a stress-producing event in larger companies.
15/wsj_1582:Mid-sized companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings. 
15/wsj_1582:The study, which received funding from Upjohn Co., which makes several drugs to treat stress-related illnesses, also found 47% of the managers said stress, anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production.
15/wsj_1582:Alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30% of those polled. 
15/wsj_1582:Although Dr. Warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses, "stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout." He also noted that various work environments, such as night work, have their own "stressors." 
15/wsj_1582:"We all like stress, but there's a limit," says Paul D'Arcy, of Rohrer, Hibler & Replogle, a corporate psychology and management consulting firm.
15/wsj_1583:IT ISN'T TRUE that a 90-year old clergyman on a mission of mercy to a disaster area on Christmas Day can fly free.
15/wsj_1583:But his circumstances are among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in America. 
15/wsj_1583:One of the best deals, though, may mean skipping Christmas dinner with the relatives.
15/wsj_1583:This week, many carriers are announcing cut-rate fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed -- and slowest -- days of the year, including Christmas. 
15/wsj_1583:"They're trying to keep planes flying on days they'd normally park them," says Roger Bard, president of Mr. Mitchell Travel Service in Burnsville, N.C. 
15/wsj_1583:Expect, of course, sky-high prices on other dates near the holidays when the airlines know vacationers are eager to travel. 
15/wsj_1583:The Continental catch: Only immediate family members are allowed, and they must have the same last name as the buyer of the ticket or legal proof they're related. 
15/wsj_1583:That irritates many women who haven't taken their husbands' last name. "What a bunch of nonsense," says Jessica Crosby, president of the New York chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners. "This sets things way back." 
15/wsj_1583:Continental's logic: It doesn't want business companions abusing the promotion by falsely claiming to be related. "We accommodate their choice of names by allowing them to demonstrate" family affiliation with legal documents, says Jim O'Donnell, a senior vice president. 
15/wsj_1583:The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund of New York City has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline doesn't recognize as family. "It's certainly discrimination," says attorney Evan Wolfson, whose group forced Trans World Airlines this year to change a rule that allowed travelers to transfer frequent flier awards only to family members. 
15/wsj_1583:WHEN HURRICANE Hugo careened through the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast states, it downed electric and telephone lines, shot coconuts through cottage rooftops, shattered windows and uprooted thousands of lives.
15/wsj_1583:Since the hurricane, Midway Airlines Inc. and American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., trimmed their one-way fares to the Virgin Islands to $109 from prices that were at times double that before the storm.
15/wsj_1584:In an official release, BP said initial production from the field was 11,000 barrels a day, and that it expects peak output from the field of 15,000 barrels a day to be reached in 1990. 
15/wsj_1585:As the sponsor of the "Older Americans Freedom to Work Act," which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older, I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil. 
15/wsj_1585:For every dollar earned over $8,880, Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits; it's like a 50% marginal tax.
15/wsj_1585:But the compounded effects of "seniors only" taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates. 
15/wsj_1585:Imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax.
15/wsj_1585:Although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage, largely due to the earnings limit, she would have to earn an additional $4,930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of $496. 
15/wsj_1585:Since all four Republicans on the committee are co-sponsors of my bill, it is the Democrats who will be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor. 
15/wsj_1585:The time is now to lift the burdensome Social Security earnings limit from the backs of our nation's seniors. 
15/wsj_1586:But just down Seventh Avenue, where about 75% of U.S. fur garments are made, Larry Rosen has acquired two retail outlets, broadened his fur-making line and expanded into leather.
15/wsj_1586:The difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10 years.
15/wsj_1586:Mr. Rosen, though, believes imports have reinvigorated the industry in which he has worked for most of his 57 years. "You've got some minds here that won't think progressively," he says. 
15/wsj_1586:Jindo Furs, a large South Korean maker, says it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next year.
15/wsj_1586:Mr. Purnick and other old-line furriers call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made.
15/wsj_1586:By combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad, he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost.
15/wsj_1586:To maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources, he says he still makes most of his furs in the U.S.
15/wsj_1586:He plans to attach the embroidery to the backs of mink coats and jackets.
15/wsj_1586:Seymour Schreibman, the 65-year-old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc., treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment.
15/wsj_1586:He says it accounts for 25% of total sales. 
15/wsj_1586:Golden Feldman Furs Inc. began retailing aggressively eight years ago, and now retail sales account for about 20% of gross income. 
15/wsj_1586:Since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the Midwest.
15/wsj_1586:Such moves have helped Mr. Rosen weather the industry slump of recent years.
15/wsj_1586:Aftereffects of the 1987 stock market crash head the list of reasons.
15/wsj_1586:But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump, fear that furs are losing part of their allure. "People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business," says Stephen Sanders, divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field's department store in Chicago. 
15/wsj_1586:"You can't make a commodity out of a luxury," insists Mr. Purnick, the New York furrier.
15/wsj_1586:He contends that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs. 
15/wsj_1586:The name of the game is to move goods." 
15/wsj_1587:Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis, and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection, company and city officials said. 
15/wsj_1587:GTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by GTE's private food vending contractor, ARA Services Inc., was suffering from a strain of the virus, officials said.
15/wsj_1587:The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted hasn't been determined but should be known by the end of the week, Dr. McBride said. 
15/wsj_1587:Hepatitis A, considered the least dangerous strain of the virus, has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee, company and city officials said. 
15/wsj_1587:"From a public health point of view we're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening," said Dr. Frank Provato, GTE's medical director. "It's a double-edged sword though, because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis." 
15/wsj_1587:The company has begun offering shots of gamma globulin, which will diminish the flu-like symptoms of hepatitis A, in anyone who has contracted the disease, Mr. Mattausch said. 
15/wsj_1588:I was appalled to read the misstatements of facts in your Oct. 13 editorial "Colombia's Brave Publisher." It is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers, not the left wing.
15/wsj_1588:Past Colombian government tolerance of the "narcotraficantes" was due to the drug lords' history of wiping out leftists in the hinterlands. 
15/wsj_1588:I suggest that The Wall Street Journal (as well as other U.S. news publications of like mind) should put its money where its mouth is: Lend computer equipment to replace that damaged at El Espectador, buy ad space, publish stories under the bylines of El Espectador journalists.
15/wsj_1589:COCA-COLA Co. (Atlanta) -- Anton Amon and George Gourlay were elected vice presidents of this soft-drink company.
15/wsj_1589:Mr. Amon, 46 years old, is the company's director of quality assurance; most recently, he served as vice president, operations, for Coca-Cola Enterprises.
15/wsj_1590:In the wake of a slide in sterling, a tailspin in the stock market, and a string of problematic economic indicators, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy. 
15/wsj_1590:In a speech prepared for delivery to London's financial community, Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy, using high interest rates as "the essential instrument" to carry out the campaign.
15/wsj_1590:A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses' expectations of future inflation, he argued.
15/wsj_1590:In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency, he stated that the exchange rates will have a "major role in the assessment of monetary conditions." 
15/wsj_1590:In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound, Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy.
15/wsj_1590:Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain's financial system. 
15/wsj_1590:Mr. Lawson's speech, delivered at the Lord Mayor of London's annual dinner at Mansion House, came on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy.
15/wsj_1590:Despite the increase, the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week.
15/wsj_1590:Leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the British war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed.
15/wsj_1590:While lower joblessness is generally good news, the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy isn't slowing down as much as hoped -- despite a doubling of interest rates over the last 16 months. 
15/wsj_1590:In a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, Bank of England governor, conceded that "demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated" when the British economy was heating up last year.
15/wsj_1590:Discussing the recent slide in stock prices, the central bank governor stated that "the markets now appear to have steadied" after the "nasty jolt" of the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average a week ago.
15/wsj_1590:Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index, Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared "that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy." Specifically, he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market, the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings. 
15/wsj_1590:Discussing future monetary arrangements, Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, but he didn't indicate when. 
15/wsj_1591:The new chip "is a very big step in computing, and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product," said Patricia Meagher Davis, an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London.
15/wsj_1591:Executives at Olivetti, whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years, have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market. 
15/wsj_1591:Although Olivetti's profits tumbled 40% in the first half of this year, she believes Olivetti's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year, especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December. "We think the worst is over" in the European information-technology market, she said. 
15/wsj_1591:Depending on the type of software and peripherals used, the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals (a role usually filled by a minicomputer), as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer. "It's the missing link" in Olivetti's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers, the Olivetti spokesman said.
15/wsj_1592:Viatech Inc. said it received approval from the French government for its proposed $44.7 million acquisition of Ferembal S.A. 
15/wsj_1592:The approval satisfies the remaining conditions of the purchase, which is expected to close within two weeks. 
15/wsj_1592:erembal, the second-largest maker of food cans in France, had 1988 sales of $150 million.
15/wsj_1593:Social Security benefits will rise 4.7% next year to keep pace with inflation, boosting the average monthly benefit to $566 from $541, the Department of Health and Human Services announced. 
15/wsj_1593:The inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the Social Security trust fund will rise to $50,400 in 1990 from $48,000 this year.
15/wsj_1593:The adjustments reflect the increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year. 
15/wsj_1594:Medical-supply houses are expected to report earnings increases of about 15% on average for the third quarter, despite sales increases of less than 10%, analysts say.
15/wsj_1594:Sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers, such as hospitals, to hold down prices.
15/wsj_1594:The Franklin Lakes, N.J., company is expected to report sales growth of only 5% to 6%, but should still maintain earnings growth of 10%, says Jerry E. Fuller, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. 
15/wsj_1594:Among the first of the group to post results, Abbott Laboratories said third-quarter net income jumped 14% to $196 million, or 88 cents a share, from $172 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier.
15/wsj_1594:Takeover speculation, which has been buoying stocks of supply houses, may also ease, says Peter Sidoti, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "As that wanes, you're going to see the stocks probably wane as well," he says. 
15/wsj_1594:Bolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals, National Medical Enterprises Inc., Los Angeles, reported net income of $50 million, or 65 cents a share, for the first quarter ended Aug. 31, up from $41 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier.
15/wsj_1594:Humana Inc., Louisville, Ky., also reported favorable results, with net income of $66.7 million, or 66 cents, in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31, up from $58.2 million, or 59 cents, a year earlier. 
15/wsj_1594:Analysts say the handful of hospital companies that are still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends.
15/wsj_1594:Most important, hospital admission rates are stabilizing after several years of decline.
15/wsj_1594:Moreover, companies have sold off many of their smaller, less-profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings.
15/wsj_1595:The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000, or 2.2% of those covered by unemployment insurance, from 2,205,000 the previous week, when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2%. 
15/wsj_1595:Counting all state and federal benefit programs, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier.
15/wsj_1595:A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states, particularly North Carolina and South Carolina.
15/wsj_1596:Although the second-largest computer maker had prepared Wall Street for a poor quarter, analysts said they were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders.
15/wsj_1596:A spokesman also said margins for the company's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector. 
15/wsj_1596:The lack of a strong product at the high end of Digital's line was a significant drag on sales.
15/wsj_1596:Digital hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe-class computers next Tuesday.
15/wsj_1596:"Until the new mainframe products kick in, there won't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end, and that's hurt us," said Mark Steinkrauss, Digital's director of investor relations.
15/wsj_1596:But analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly 40-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, that shouldn't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength.
15/wsj_1596:"I think the next few quarters will be difficult," said Steven Milunovich of First Boston. "Margins will remain under pressure, and when the new mainframe does ship, I'm not sure it will be a big winner." Mr. Milunovich said he was revising his estimate for DEC's current year from $8.20 a share to "well below $8," although he hasn't settled on a final number. 
15/wsj_1596:One troubling aspect of DEC's results, analysts said, was its performance in Europe.
15/wsj_1596:DEC said its overseas business, which now accounts for more than half of sales, improved in the quarter.
15/wsj_1596:It even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in Europe were up in "double digits" in foreign-currency terms. 
15/wsj_1596:That gain probably translated into about 5% to 7% in dollar terms, well below recent quarters' gains of above 20%, reckons Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds. "That was a disappointment" and a sign of overall computer-market softness in Europe, Mr. Stevens said. 
15/wsj_1596:Marc Schulman, with UBS Securities in New York, dropped his estimate of DEC's full-year net to $6.80 a share from $8.
15/wsj_1596:Mr. Schulman said he believes that the roll-out of DEC's new mainframe will "occur somewhat more leisurely" than many of his investment colleagues expect.
15/wsj_1596:He said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in December, with all of the more sophisticated versions out by June.
15/wsj_1597:In the year-earlier period, Colgate posted net income of $60.2 million, or 88 cents a share.
15/wsj_1597:Last year's results included earnings from discontinued operations of $13.1 million, or 19 cents a share. 
15/wsj_1597:Reuben Mark, chairman and chief executive officer of Colgate, said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in Latin America, the Far East and Europe.
15/wsj_1597:"We've done a lot to improve (U.S.) results and a lot more will be done," Mr. Mark said. "Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company." 
15/wsj_1597:Colgate's results were at the high end of the range of analysts' forecasts.
15/wsj_1597:The scope of the improvement in the U.S. business caught some analysts by surprise.
15/wsj_1597:Separately, Colgate Wednesday finalized an agreement with MacroChem Corp., a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in Billerica, Mass., to market in the U.S. four of MacroChem's FDA-approved dental products.
15/wsj_1597:The move is part of a drive to increase Colgate's business with dentists, a company spokeswoman said.
15/wsj_1597:Terms of the agreement weren't given. 
15/wsj_1598:USACafes Limited Partnership said it completed the sale of its Bonanza restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of Metromedia Co. for $71 million in cash. 
15/wsj_1598:USACafes, which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas, said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible.
15/wsj_1598:The Bonanza franchise system, which generates about $600 million in sales annually, represented substantially all of the partnership's assets. 
15/wsj_1598:The sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a Delaware court, USACafes said.
15/wsj_1599:AT&T said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments.
15/wsj_1599:AT&T said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans, it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program. 
15/wsj_1599:AT&T said third-quarter net income grew, despite stiff competition in all of the company's markets.
15/wsj_1599:The latest period's net was reduced $102 million, or nine cents a share, for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment. 
15/wsj_1599:The results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts, who were encouraged by AT&T increasing its operating margin to 13% from 11% a year ago, because of continued cost-cutting efforts.
15/wsj_1599:Sales of long-distance services, an extremely competitive market, rose 6.4%.
15/wsj_1599:Under the amended pension program, AT&T managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes.
15/wsj_1599:An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees.
15/wsj_1599:Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package, which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months. "This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth," said Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. 
15/wsj_1599:But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move won't result in even greater earnings growth. "This is a good move, but it only gets you to where people's expectations already are," in terms of earnings growth, said Joel D. Gross, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
15/wsj_1599:Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20% annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts it expects in the future. 
16/wsj_1600:Every dollar's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year, the firm estimates.
16/wsj_1600:Westridge Capital is an index fund -- the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average. 
16/wsj_1600:Westridge Capital's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing.
16/wsj_1600:Institutional investors have poured $210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns.
16/wsj_1600:These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few "active" stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers, much less beat it. 
16/wsj_1600:And the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each $100 of assets -- a fraction of the cost of active managers.
16/wsj_1600:That's because computers do most of the work, and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs. 
16/wsj_1600:"Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade, but the index money has been just sort of sitting there," says Seth M. Lynn, president of Axe Core Investors Inc., an indexer based in Tarrytown, N.Y. "Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money." Among the souped-up indexing strategies: Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks, or just a few dozen, rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies.
16/wsj_1600:They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks, such as smaller companies, those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry, state or country. 
16/wsj_1600:Futures and options also make it possible to build "synthetic" index funds that don't actually own a single share of stock, but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market. 
16/wsj_1600:One reason for these hybrids is that indexing's rapid growth is slowing, particularly for those "plain vanilla" funds that mirror the S&P 500. "There isn't a boatload {of big investors} out there still waiting to get into indexing," says P. James Kartalia, vice president of ANB Investment Management Co., Chicago, which offers both indexing and active management services. (After tripling in size in the past five years, index funds now hold about 20% of the stock owned by pension funds.) 
16/wsj_1600:And many have been successful, as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader Westridge Capital. 
16/wsj_1600:The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks, and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies. 
16/wsj_1600:J. Thomas Allen, president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc., agrees it's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures. "You're buying the S&P, and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it," he says. 
16/wsj_1600:But some indexers make little or no use of futures, saying that these instruments present added risks for investors. "If the futures markets have a problem, then those products could have a problem," says John Zumbrunn, managing director of Prudential Insurance Co. of America's Investment Index Technologies Inc. unit. 
16/wsj_1600:Prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus 5/100 of a percentage point.
16/wsj_1600:There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds.
16/wsj_1600:Here a fund may promise to pay back, say, $95 of every $100 invested for a year, even if the market goes much lower.
16/wsj_1600:Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks, indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks; the portfolio will be maintained by computer, reducing both fees and, in theory, risk (because of the large number of stocks). "We see a lot of interest in those kind of things," says Frank Salerno, a vice president of Bankers Trust. "People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies." 
16/wsj_1600:Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly, some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio.
16/wsj_1600:Another approach: An investor with $100 million might use $75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other $25 million on a favorite group of stocks. 
16/wsj_1600:SPECIALIZED FUNDS: Indexes can be constructed to serve social goals, such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa.
16/wsj_1600:Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System, for example, has about $130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either Pennsylvania-based or have 25% of their work forces in the state. 
16/wsj_1601:Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month, this time 4.2%, while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest. 
16/wsj_1601:The Big Board reported that short interest dropped to 523,920,214 shares as of Oct. 13 from 547,347,585 shares in mid-September.
16/wsj_1601:Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet been purchased for return to lenders.
16/wsj_1601:Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging.
16/wsj_1601:The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month's 3.38.
16/wsj_1601:The ratio is the number of trading days, at the exchange's average trading volume, that would be required to convert the total short interest position. 
16/wsj_1601:Varity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares.
16/wsj_1601:Varity has proposed to acquire K-H Corp., consisting of the auto parts division and some debt of Fruehauf Corp., for $577.3 million of cash and securities. 
16/wsj_1601:Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., the entity formed from the recent acquisition of Squibb Corp. by Bristol-Myers Co., logged the largest volume decline, 7,592,988 shares, to 12,017,724. 
16/wsj_1601:The company is under an investigation concerning procedures to gain Food and Drug Administration approval of generic drugs.
16/wsj_1601:The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-October or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-September. 
16/wsj_1602:Your Oct. 12 editorial "Pitiful, Helpless Presidency?" correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3. 
16/wsj_1602:You are absolutely wrong, however, in opining that this position is some kind of "flip-flop," something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls.
16/wsj_1602:Although you may have forgotten, public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling (and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative).
16/wsj_1602:The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8, 9, 10 and 11, 1988, and again on April 4, 1988.
16/wsj_1602:It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega's criminality, and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies. 
16/wsj_1602:As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee, the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics, but made a decision in the summer of 1986 "to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled." 
16/wsj_1602:This decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the United States as a hidden cost of the war." 
16/wsj_1602:Throughout 1988 and this year, I and others in Congress have pressed the U.S. to develop a plan for pushing this "narcokleptocrat" out of Panama.
16/wsj_1603:After years of hesitation, economic and political reform was embraced at the end of 1986, but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action. 
16/wsj_1603:Though his operation was registered and used only scrap, he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials.
16/wsj_1603:After years of experimenting, Mr. Chan produced a heavy-duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state-produced rival.
16/wsj_1603:By 1982, he was selling thousands of tires.
16/wsj_1603:But a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity, acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property.
16/wsj_1603:With only the clothes they were wearing, family members moved to a home owned by one of Mr. Chan's sons. 
16/wsj_1603:He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice, pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights.
16/wsj_1603:Mr. Chan now produces 1,000 bicycle and motorbike tires a month and 1,000 tins of tire-patching glue in the son's small house.
16/wsj_1603:Eighteen people pack the house's two rooms -- the Chans, four of their 10 children with spouses, and eight of 22 grandchildren.
16/wsj_1603:Come daybreak, eight family members and two other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street.
16/wsj_1603:Mr. Chan talks optimistically of expanding, maybe even moving into the import-export field.
16/wsj_1603:When district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing, they released only one of his machines.
16/wsj_1603:Mr. Ngoc, 57 years old, had solid reformist credentials: He had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature.
16/wsj_1603:Readers were electrified by the paper's audacity and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered. 
16/wsj_1603:The newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by Nguyen Huy Thiep, a former history teacher, who stirred debate over his interpretation of Vietnamese culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association. 
16/wsj_1603:Van Nghe quickly made influential enemies. "Those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly" to the restyled paper, says Lai Nguyen An, a literary critic.
16/wsj_1603:After months of internal rumblings, Mr. Ngoc was fired last December.
16/wsj_1603:"Under Mr. Ngoc, Van Nghe protected the people instead of the government," says Nguyen Duy, a poet who is the paper's bureau chief for southern Vietnam. "The paper reflected the truth.
16/wsj_1603:Nguyen Thi Thi is Vietnam's entrepreneur of the 1980s.
16/wsj_1603:She charged ahead of the government and the law to establish Hochiminh City Food Co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country.
16/wsj_1603:Her story is becoming part of local folklore. 
16/wsj_1603:As she rode over regulations, only her friendship with party leaders, including Nguyen Van Linh, then Ho Chi Minh City party secretary, kept her out of jail. 
16/wsj_1603:Following Mr. Linh's appointment as secretary-general of the party at the sixth congress, Mrs. Thi has become the darling of "doi moi", the Vietnamese version of perestroika.
16/wsj_1603:The authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of "the new way of thinking." 
16/wsj_1603:She manages it with the title of general-director. 
16/wsj_1603:The heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities, such as corn and coffee, from farmers in the south, paying with fertilizer, farm tools and other items.
16/wsj_1603:Last year, Hochiminh City Food says it bought two million metric tons of unhusked rice, more than 10% of the country's output. 
16/wsj_1603:The company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses.
16/wsj_1603:Mrs. Thi says Hochiminh City Food last year increased pretax profit 60% to the equivalent of about $2.7 million on sales of $150 million.
16/wsj_1604:The earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area isn't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings, officials at the two major rating agencies said. 
16/wsj_1604:Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing, with an eye toward a possible downgrade, the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds, long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company, Bay View Capital Corp. 
16/wsj_1604:"Losses from the earthquake are expected to be of similar magnitude to those of Hurricane Hugo," according to Moody's. 
16/wsj_1605:In the third paragraph it referred to the senators seeking loophole suggestions from lobbyists for various sectors of the economy.
16/wsj_1605:The Hawaii Banana Industry Association, to which nearly all of them belong, has no lobbyist. 
16/wsj_1606:Western Digital Corp. reported a net loss of $2.7 million, or nine cents a share, for its first quarter ended Sept. 30, citing factors as varied as hurricane damage, an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar. 
16/wsj_1606:In the year-ago period, the company earned $12.9 million, or 45 cents a share, on sales of $247 million.
16/wsj_1606:Sales for the just-ended period fell to about $225 million, the maker of computer parts said. 
16/wsj_1606:In its second quarter last year, Western Digital earned $12.7 million, or 44 cents a share, on sales of $258.4 million. 
16/wsj_1606:Mr. Johnson said Western Digital's plant in Puerto Rico was affected by Hurricane Hugo, losing three days' production because of the storm, which wrecked much of the Caribbean island's infrastructure.
16/wsj_1606:Although the plant itself wasn't damaged, Mr. Johnson said millions of dollars in first-quarter revenue were lost.
16/wsj_1606:Mr. Johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards.
16/wsj_1606:An accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers' to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further dampened reseller purchases of Western Digital's equipment. 
16/wsj_1606:"The other areas of the business -- storage and microcomputers -- were very good," Mr. Johnson said.
16/wsj_1606:He said Western Digital has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array, VGA, graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter, EGA, which has a lower resolution standard, technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units.
16/wsj_1606:Other makers of video controller equipment also were caught in the EGA-VGA shift, he said, "but we were able to respond much more quickly." 
16/wsj_1606:Still, Mr. Johnson said, "our stock is grossly undervalued." He said the company has cut operating expenses by about 10% over the last few quarters, while maintaining research and development at about 8% to 9% of sales. 
16/wsj_1606:As part of its reorganization this week, Western Digital has divided its business into two segments -- storage products, including controllers and disk drives; and microcomputer products, which include graphics, communications and peripheral control chips. 
16/wsj_1606:Storage, which includes computer controllers and 3.5-inch disk drives, represents nearly two-thirds of the company's business.
16/wsj_1606:Computer parts are getting ever smaller, Mr. Johnson said, a shrinking that has propelled laptops into position as the fastest-growing segment of the computer business.
16/wsj_1606:As smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry, he said, Western Digital is strengthening development of laptop parts. 
16/wsj_1606:About half of Western Digital's business is overseas, and Mr. Johnson expects that proportion to continue.
16/wsj_1606:Plans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within Europe in 1992 creates significant opportunities for the company, he said, particularly since Western Digital already manufactures there.
16/wsj_1607:Directors of state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution. 
16/wsj_1607:But under the bank's proposed statutes, an assembly of shareholders must approve board members.
16/wsj_1607:The ensuing scandal, in which the bank's management resigned, has helped renew calls for privatization, or at least an overhaul, of Italy's banking system, which is about 80% state-controlled. 
16/wsj_1607:The shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the Atlanta scandal; Consob, the stock exchange regulatory body, reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension. 
16/wsj_1609:The travel, investment services, insurance and banking concern added $110 million to reserves for credit losses at its American Express Bank unit, boosting the reserve to $507 million as of Sept. 30.
16/wsj_1609:The bank's Third World debt portfolio totals $560 million, down from $2.2 billion at the end of 1986.
16/wsj_1609:The results include $106 million of tax benefits associated with previous years' Third World loan activity, compared with $15 million a year earlier. 
16/wsj_1609:Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., as previously reported, had net of $65.9 million, reversing a $3.5 million loss a year earlier; its latest results include a $37 million gain from the sale of an institutional money management business.
16/wsj_1609:American Express's share of Shearson's earnings was $41 million, after preferred stock dividends; it owns about 68% of Shearson's common. 
16/wsj_1610:Revenue of $1.73 billion was almost unchanged from last year's $1.72 billion.
16/wsj_1610:Per-share net of 66 cents, down from 72 cents, fell by more than overall net because of more shares outstanding. 
16/wsj_1610:For the nine months, Textron reported net of $182.1 million, or $2.06 a share, on revenue of $5.41 billion.
16/wsj_1610:A year ago, net was $170.4 million, or $1.93 a share, on revenue of $5.3 billion.
16/wsj_1610:The nine-month results included a $9.5 million special charge in 1989 for an arbitration settlement related to past export sales, and $29.7 million in extraordinary charges in 1988 related to a former line of business and early redemption of debt. 
16/wsj_1610:Textron said that nine-months' results don't include earnings of Avdel PLC, a British maker of industrial fasteners, but do include interest costs of $16.4 million on borrowings related to the proposed purchase of Avdel.
16/wsj_1610:A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the purchase because of Federal Trade Commission concerns that the transaction would reduce competition in the production of two kinds of rivets. 
16/wsj_1610:For the quarter, Textron said aerospace revenue, including Bell helicopter and jet-engine manufacture, declined 9.8% to $755.9 million from $838.3 million, an indication of slowing government defense work. 
16/wsj_1611:Under it, the former billionaire's assets would be liquidated with the IRS getting 80% of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other creditors, including Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., which is seeking repayment of a $36 million loan. 
16/wsj_1611:A similiar proposal has been made in the W. Herbert Hunt case although he and the IRS are at odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt he would have to pay to the government from future earnings. 
16/wsj_1611:In both cases, Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie.
16/wsj_1611:With support from the IRS, Manufacturers Hanover has filed suit asking Judge Abramson to subordinate Minpeco's claim to those of Manufacturer Hanover and the IRS. Minpeco has threatened a "volcano" of litigation if the Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit attempts to force such a plan through the court. 
16/wsj_1611:Minpeco attorney Thomas Gorman decribed the plan as one step toward an overall settlement of the W. Herbert Hunt case but Hugh Ray, attorney for Manufacturers Hanover, called it "silly" and said he would fight it in court. 
16/wsj_1612:Banc One Corp. said it agreed in principle to buy five branch offices from Trustcorp Inc., Toledo, Ohio, following the planned merger of Trustcorp into Society Corp., Cleveland. 
16/wsj_1612:The five offices in Erie and Ottawa counties in northern Ohio have total assets of about $88 million, Banc One said.
16/wsj_1612:The purchase price will be established after Banc One has an opportunity to study the quality of the assets, Banc One said. 
16/wsj_1612:Society Corp. already has branches in the area, and selling the Trustcorp offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of Trustcorp into Society, according to industry sources.
16/wsj_1613:The increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds.
16/wsj_1613:Individual investors, represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories, pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds, said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist of the Institute. 
16/wsj_1613:At the auction of six-month U.S. Treasury bills on Monday, the average yield fell to 7.61% from 7.82%.
16/wsj_1613:Likewise, certificates of deposit on average posted lower yields in the week ended Tuesday. 
16/wsj_1614:Domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd. 's most recent spate of financial troubles, the institution's executive chairman, Mohamed Basir Ismail, said. 
16/wsj_1614:The predicament, he added, was similar to the Hong Kong 1982-83 property-price collapse, which exposed the involvement of Bank Bumiputra's former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in Malaysia's history.
16/wsj_1614:Once the plan is approved, Tan Sri Basir said, most of Bank Bumiputra's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between M$160 million and M$170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31.
16/wsj_1614:For the previous financial year, the bank would have reported a pretax profit of M$168 million if it hadn't made provisions for the nonperforming loans, he said. 
16/wsj_1614:But public documents indicate 10% or more of the bank's provisions were made for foregone interest on a M$200 million loan to Malaysia's dominant political party, the United Malays National Organization, to build its convention and headquarters complex in Kuala Lumpur.
16/wsj_1614:"We lent a lot of money all over the place," said Tan Sri Basir, who refused to discuss the bank's outstanding loans to 
16/wsj_1614:As well as the M$1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6, the restructuring package covers an additional M$450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank's paid-up capital.
16/wsj_1614:At the end of the exercise, the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank's paid-up capital to M$1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions. 
16/wsj_1615:White, 24 years old, a singer in her church choir, she symbolizes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to Ronald Reagan. "I felt kind of safe," she says. 
16/wsj_1615:Then a political novice, she stepped into a whirl of "pro-choice" marches, house parties and fund-raisers.
16/wsj_1615:"This is one where I cross party lines," she says, rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. Florio's opponent, Reagan-Republican Rep. James Courter. "People my age thought it wasn't going to be an issue.
16/wsj_1615:Polls bear out this warning, but after a decade of increased Republican influence here, the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter.
16/wsj_1615:This change comes less from a shift in public opinion, which hasn't changed much on abortion over the past decade, than in the boundaries of the debate.
16/wsj_1615:Now, the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension, bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces.
16/wsj_1615:A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands, and in a major reversal, Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest. 
16/wsj_1615:"If Webster hadn't happened, you wouldn't be here," Linda Bowker tells a reporter in the Trenton office of the National Organization for Women. "We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter . . . and no one would have heard us." 
16/wsj_1615:The infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures.
16/wsj_1615:The league organizers seem more a fit with a convention next door of young aerobics instructors in leotards than the beefy union leaders; "I wish I could go work out," says a slim activist.
16/wsj_1615:A labor chief speaks sardonically of having to "man and woman" Election Day phones. 
16/wsj_1615:Abortion alone can't explain this shift, but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate.
16/wsj_1615:The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark "I'm-coming-down-your-throat" intensity, but at a pause in Newark's Columbus Day parade recently, he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city's old Italian-American ward.
16/wsj_1615:Mr. Courter, by comparison, seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran-Contra hearings two years ago.
16/wsj_1615:Looking back, he says he erred by stating his "personal" opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he wouldn't impose his views on "policy" as governor.
16/wsj_1615:"He doesn't know himself," Kathy Stanwick of the Abortion Rights League says of Mr. Courter's position.
16/wsj_1615:Even abortion opponents, however angry with Mr. Florio, can't hide their frustration with the Republican's ambivalence. "He doesn't want to lead the people," says Richard Traynor, president of New Jersey Right to Life. 
16/wsj_1615:Elected to Congress in 1978, the 48-year-old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan.
16/wsj_1615:Like many of his colleagues, he didn't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy -- even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors. 
16/wsj_1615:The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter's fortunes, but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate, pro-choice Gov. Kean.
16/wsj_1615:While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government, anti-tax agenda in Washington, Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey's budget in his eight years in office. 
16/wsj_1615:Mr. Courter is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers. 
16/wsj_1615:When he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization's 20th anniversary, he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in Camden. 
16/wsj_1615:In the opinion of many, he hasn't stopped running since, even though he declined a rematch with Gov. Kean in 1985.
16/wsj_1615:His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge.
16/wsj_1615:A toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer.
16/wsj_1615:Mr. Florio savors this vindication, but at age 52, the congressman is also a product of his times and losses.
16/wsj_1615:Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter's team, and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean, mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s.
16/wsj_1615:The Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines, but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county's past corruption.
16/wsj_1615:His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state, and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment, he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater, Trenton State College. 
16/wsj_1615:Mr. Florio's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the Webster ruling divides some of his old constituency.
16/wsj_1615:Pasquale Pignatelli, an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an Essex County Irish bagpipe band, speaks sadly of Mr. Florio. "I am a devout Catholic," says Mr. Pignatelli, a 40-year-old health officer. "I can't support him because of abortion." 
16/wsj_1615:A security guard at a cargo terminal, he wears a Sons of Italy jacket and cap celebrating "The US 1 Band." "I still think the woman has the right to do with her body as she pleases," he says. "If you want more opinions ask my wife.
16/wsj_1615:She has lots of opinions." 
16/wsj_1616:They also said the dollar is leveling off after a rise this summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods. 
16/wsj_1616:"We've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months, and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now," said Jay Woodworth, chief domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. in New York. 
16/wsj_1616:Though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices, many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year. 
16/wsj_1616:Still, some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind. "It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem," argued Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. 
16/wsj_1616:A run-up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7% annual rate in the first five months of this year, but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4%. 
16/wsj_1616:Mr. Yardeni predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices. "The bottom line is, it seems to me that the economic environment has become very, very competitve for a lot of businesses," he said. "Back in 1987-88, business was operating at fairly tight capacity, so businesses felt they could raise prices." Now, he said, a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand. 
16/wsj_1616:Analysts say Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy. 
16/wsj_1616:Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food -- leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate -- consumer prices still rose only 0.2% in September.
16/wsj_1616:Apparel prices rocketed up 1.7%, but that was after three months of declines.
16/wsj_1616:Medical costs continued their steep ascent, rising 0.8% after four consecutive months of 0.7% increases. 
16/wsj_1616:Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for September. 
16/wsj_1617:Such efforts -- unheard of only a few years ago -- are the latest attempts to revive the sagging $1.76 billion U.S. ski industry.
16/wsj_1617:Since the start of the decade, lift-ticket sales have grown only 3% a year on average, compared with 16% annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s.
16/wsj_1617:By some estimates, nearly a fourth of all U.S. ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early '80s. 
16/wsj_1617:Competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undoing of many resorts.
16/wsj_1617:But another big problem has been the aging of baby boomers.
16/wsj_1617:One 60-second TV spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes: senior citizens, minorities, families with children -- even a blind skier. "Ski school is great," cries out a tot, bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope. "You'll never know 'til you try," says a black skier. 
16/wsj_1617:"We used to show some hot-dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff," says Kathe Dillmann, a spokeswoman for the United Ski Industries Association, the trade group sponsoring the campaign. 
16/wsj_1617:Ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety.
16/wsj_1617:The ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers; normally, they only run ads hyping their own products and facilities.
16/wsj_1617:Many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business.
16/wsj_1617:Since 40% of skiers are parents, many slopes are building nurseries, expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids.
16/wsj_1617:A few years ago, parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children. "Most parents who had to go through that never came back," says Michael Shannon, president of Vail Associates Inc., which owns and operates the Vail and nearby Beaver Creek resorts. 
16/wsj_1617:"People these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar," says Don Borgeson, executive director of Angel Fire, N.M.'s Chamber of Commerce. 
16/wsj_1617:The ski industry hopes to increase the number of skiers by 3.5 million to about 21.7 million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions.
16/wsj_1617:An American Express Co. survey of its travel agents revealed that only 34% believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports, as opposed to 69% who think that warm-weather sports will be the deciding factor. 
16/wsj_1617:"Even if they could bring in that many new skiers, I don't know if {the industry} could handle that kind of an increase," says I. William Berry, editor and publisher of the Ski Industry Letter in Katonah, N.Y. "Most people will come on the weekend, the slopes will be overcrowded and then these {new skiers} won't come back." 
16/wsj_1618:They didn't play the third game of the World Series on Tuesday night as scheduled, and they didn't play it on Wednesday or Thursday either.
16/wsj_1618:But, at least, the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side. 
16/wsj_1618:It may seem trivial to worry about the World Series amid the destruction to the Bay Area wrought by Tuesday's quake, but the name of this column is "On Sports," so I feel obliged to do so.
16/wsj_1618:You might be interested to know that baseball, not survival, appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of 60,000-odd that had gathered at Candlestick at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday, a half-hour before game time, when the quake struck.
16/wsj_1618:As soon as the tremor passed, many people spontaneously arose and cheered, as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show. 
16/wsj_1618:One fan, seated several rows in front of the open, upper-deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed, faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted, "We arranged that just for you guys!" I thought and, I'm sure, others did: "You shouldn't have bothered." 
16/wsj_1618:Perhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into people's faces and asking how they "feel" about one calamity or another, fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat. 
16/wsj_1618:Dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding, the general inclination was to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played. "I was near the top of the stadium, and saw a steel girder bow six feet from where I sat, but I stayed put for 10 or 15 minutes," confessed a friend. "I guess I thought, `This is the World Series and I'm not gonna wimp out!'" 
16/wsj_1618:Within a few minutes, the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear.
16/wsj_1618:A section of the Bay Bridge had collapsed, as had a part of Interstate Highway 880 in Oakland.
16/wsj_1618:The stadium was ordered evacuated soon afterward; the announcement, made over police bullhorns, cited the power outage, but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend.
16/wsj_1618:Outside, I spotted two young men lugging blocks of concrete. "Pieces of Candlestick," they said. 
16/wsj_1618:The traffic jam out of the park was monumental.
16/wsj_1618:With Garpian randomness, a hotel across the street, the Amfac, had been hit harder: A large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away. 
16/wsj_1618:Should the rest of the Series be played at all?
16/wsj_1618:The quake and baseball weren't related, unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the 1972 Olympics.
16/wsj_1618:Flags fly at half-staff for the death of Bart Giamatti, the late baseball commissioner, and now the Bay Bridge lies in ruins.
16/wsj_1618:A Series that was shaping up as the dullest since the one-sided Detroit-over-San Diego go of 1984 has become memorable in the least fortunate way.
16/wsj_1619:But two big New York banks seem to have kicked those chances away, for the moment, with the embarrassing failure of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. to deliver $7.2 billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. 
16/wsj_1619:Those expanded powers reached their zenith in July when Bankers Trust New York Corp. provided mergers advice, an equity investment and bank loans for the $3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. 
16/wsj_1619:One of the major selling points used by Los Angeles financier Alfred Checchi in getting the takeover approved was that the deal didn't include any junk bonds.
16/wsj_1619:That was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and Washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover.
16/wsj_1619:Charles Nathan, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc., says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs.
16/wsj_1619:Mr. Batchelder says that in the past, banks would normally have loaned 65% of a total buy-out price, with the loans secured by the target company's assets.
16/wsj_1619:Another 20% of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds, which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans.
16/wsj_1619:Mr. Checchi's purchase of NWA, Mr. Batchelder notes, "was probably the most aggressive to date," with bank debt at 85% of the purchase price. 
16/wsj_1619:But Mr. Batchelder says that Citicorp's "failure to deliver" on its promise to raise the UAL bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group "is very distressing to potential users of a `highly-confident' letter from commercial banks." His client, Mr. Davis, used just such a letter from Citicorp in pursuing UAL; Citicorp later agreed to work with a competing UAL buy-out group. 
16/wsj_1619:Executives of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan declined to comment on either the UAL situation, or on the changing nature of banks' role in financing takeovers. 
16/wsj_1619:In the wake of Campeau's problems, prices of junk bonds tumbled, throwing into doubt the ability of corporate acquirers to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales. 
16/wsj_1619:In fact, Manufacturers Hanover said in its third-quarter earnings report that fees from syndicating loans to other banks dropped 48%, to $21 million. "We didn't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor," says a bank spokesman. 
16/wsj_1619:James B. Lee, head of syndications and private placements at Chemical Banking Corp., said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of one-stop shopping for takeover finance.
16/wsj_1619:As evidence, he cites yesterday's arrangement for the final financing of a $3 billion bid for American Medical International Inc. in which Chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor. 
16/wsj_1619:A Paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial, not political, drawbacks of junk bonds. 
16/wsj_1619:But some observers believe Paramount Chairman Martin Davis wanted to avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for Time.
16/wsj_1619:The success of the NWA financing, and the failure of the UAL deal, also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by Japanese banks. 
16/wsj_1619:Japanese banks accounted for 50% of the NWA bank debt, according to a report by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner.
16/wsj_1619:But it was broad-scale rejection by Japanese banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy UAL. Citicorp and Chase are attempting to put together a new, lower bid. 
16/wsj_1619:Takanori Mizuno, chief economist of the Institute for Financial Affairs Inc., a Tokyo research center on finance and economics, says, "The junk bond market became very jittery, and there's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of LBO companies.
16/wsj_1620:Harley-Davidson Inc. filed suit in federal court here, alleging that a group that holds 6.2% of its stock made "false, deceptive and misleading" statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements. 
16/wsj_1620:Harley-Davidson's complaint claims that the group, led by investor Malcolm I. Glazer, violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15% of the company's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filing eventually was made, it didn't disclose the group's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law. 
16/wsj_1620:But when Harley last week publicly questioned the legality of the group's filing procedures, the Rochester, N.Y., investor said "we complied with every law," and he denied any wrongdoing. 
16/wsj_1621:Moreover, the earnings were well below analysts' expectations of about $1.16 a share. 
16/wsj_1621:However, the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter.
16/wsj_1621:Profit of steel shipped for the company's steel segment slid to $26 a ton, from $66 a ton a year earlier and $57 a ton a quarter earlier. 
16/wsj_1621:The increased labor costs became effective Aug. 1 under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers union.
16/wsj_1621:Meanwhile, the company's service center segment, which saw operating profit drop to $11.5 million from $30.7 million a year ago, experienced much of the same demand and cost problems, as well as start-up costs associated with a coil processing facility in Chicago and an upgraded computer information system. 
16/wsj_1621:In the first nine months, profit was $113 million, or $3.04 a share, on sales of $3.19 billion, compared with $204.5 million, or $5.76 a share, on sales of $3.03 billion, a year earlier. 
16/wsj_1622:The "seismic" activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth.
16/wsj_1622:That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity.
16/wsj_1622:And when any component of the market -- cash, futures or options -- loses liquidity, the price discovery system (the way prices are determined) becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time. 
16/wsj_1622:When that happened, "seismic" tremors of fear -- much like the shock waves created by an earthquake -- coursed through the market and increased the market's volatility.
16/wsj_1622:Lack of important, needed information can cause fear.
16/wsj_1622:Fear is the father of panic.
16/wsj_1622:Because of a lack of information and access, many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed, because of their ignorance of important market information.
16/wsj_1622:Contrary to some opinions, the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole.
16/wsj_1622:It is a market attribute -- the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news. 
16/wsj_1622:As a result, while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker (which is micro-liquidity for the investor), the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction: The unwanted position is still an unwanted position; only the identity of the seller has changed.
16/wsj_1622:In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers (a result of some post-1987 crash studies) also increases market volatility, since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time, the more selling pressure is overhanging the market. 
16/wsj_1622:Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants -- not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis. 
16/wsj_1622:Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field Congress sought and called a "national market system" (not yet achieved) almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975. 
16/wsj_1622:Mr. Peake is chairman of his own consulting company in Englewood, N.J. 
16/wsj_1623:For the past seven years, investors have had the wind at their backs, in the form of a generally growing economy.
16/wsj_1623:In a nutshell, pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in "defensive" industries.
16/wsj_1623:A heavy dose of cash is prescribed, along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds -- preferably government bonds. 
16/wsj_1623:When they do hit, they hit fast," says David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at the Data Resources division of McGraw-Hill Inc. 
16/wsj_1623:The reason is simple, Mr. Wyss says: "Interest rates almost always decline during recession." As surely as a seesaw tilts, falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds.
16/wsj_1623:This hurts the price of corporate bonds.
16/wsj_1623:That means that a corporation, after a specified amount of time has passed, can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value (plus, in some cases, a sweetener).
16/wsj_1623:If corporate bonds are bad in recessions, junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all.
16/wsj_1623:It's an "absolute necessity" to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing, says Avner Arbel, professor of finance at Cornell University. "Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside, and this could be a disaster." 
16/wsj_1623:One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach, director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co., a brokerage house in Houston, who thinks that "we're either in a recession or about to go into one." What's more, he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual: "Once the downturn comes, it's going to be very hard to reverse." 
16/wsj_1623:Because he sees a "5% to 6% base rate of inflation in the economy," he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon. 
16/wsj_1623:Instead, Mr. Beach says, investors "probably should be carrying a very high level of cash," by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills.
16/wsj_1623:Greg Confair, president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown, Pa., also recommends that investors go heavily for cash.
16/wsj_1623:And, in a sense, that's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks -- the mainstay of most serious investors' portfolios.
16/wsj_1623:It comes down to a question of whether to try to "time" the market. 
16/wsj_1623:Most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9% to 10%, including both dividends and price appreciation.
16/wsj_1623:Moreover, because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming, some analysts think investors shouldn't even worry too much about timing. "Trying to time the economy is a mistake," says David Katz, chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York.
16/wsj_1623:Mr. Katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70% of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy.
16/wsj_1623:And the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market's gains over time. 
16/wsj_1623:According to Ned Davis, president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis, Fla., the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21%, and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started. 
16/wsj_1623:By the time a recession is "official" (two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product), much of the damage to stocks has already been done-and, in the typical case, the recession is already half over.
16/wsj_1623:But whatever their advice about timing, none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession.
16/wsj_1623:For the portion of an investor's portfolio that stays in stocks, professionals have a number of suggestions.
16/wsj_1623:And in any case, he argues, stocks of small companies are "almost as overpriced as they were Sept. 30, 1987, just before the crash." 
16/wsj_1623:For example, Mr. Arbel says, stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow. (Cash flow, basically earnings plus depreciation, is one common gauge of a company's financial health.) That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash, Mr. Arbel says.
16/wsj_1623:George Putnam III, editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston, offers one final tip for recession-wary investors. "Keep some money available for opportunities," he says. "If the recession does hit, there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest." 
16/wsj_1623:The following shows the number of times these industries outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index during the first six months of the past seven recessions. 
16/wsj_1624:The issue by Chicago & North Western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar.
16/wsj_1624:Some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk. 
16/wsj_1624:Since last week's junk-bond market debacle, many new issues of high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back, delayed or dropped.
16/wsj_1624:On Wednesday, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines' junk-bond offering to $71 million from $150 million.
16/wsj_1624:Prudential-Bache said the York issue was delayed because of market conditions. 
16/wsj_1624:Dan Baldwin, managing director of high-yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management, said the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured in part because "several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package.
16/wsj_1624:But several mutual-fund managers, nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues, said they're staying away from any junk security that isn't considered first rate for its class.
16/wsj_1624:The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10% of the stock of CNW Corp., Chicago & North Western's parent company.
16/wsj_1624:According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations, the 10% of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank Blackstone Group, which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5% each.
16/wsj_1624:It is considered an early signal of Fed credit policy changes. 
16/wsj_1624:The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 25/32 to yield 7.955%, compared with 100 29/32 to yield 8.032% Wednesday.
16/wsj_1624:Meanwhile, the Treasury sold $9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday.
16/wsj_1624:Here are details of the auction: 
16/wsj_1624:Petrolane Gas Service's 13 1/4% debentures traded at 102, after trading around par earlier this week, and RJR's 13 1/2% subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5/8 after trading at below par earlier this week. 
16/wsj_1624:Activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market, as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector. 
16/wsj_1624:Traders estimated that more than $140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers.
16/wsj_1624:According to market participants, the bonds were met with decent bids, but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield. 
16/wsj_1624:New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was up 3/8 at 98 3/8 bid to yield about 7.32%, down 0.03 percentage point. 
16/wsj_1624:The debt of some California issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday's massive earthquake, although traders said market participants remained cautious. 
16/wsj_1624:It's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve, said Cindy Katz, assistant director of California's department of finance, although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose isn't anticipated. 
16/wsj_1624:The largest sale in the competitive arena was a $55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority.
16/wsj_1624:A balance of $25.8 million remained in late order-taking, according to the lead manager. 
16/wsj_1624:Mortgage securities generally ended 6/32 to 9/32 point higher, but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts. 
16/wsj_1624:Premium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon rates of 13% and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by Congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages. 
16/wsj_1624:In the current-coupon sector, a shift in the Treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings.
16/wsj_1624:While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the Treasury yield curve, underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable. 
16/wsj_1624:British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. 
16/wsj_1624:In Japan, the bellwether No. 111 4.6% bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72, to yield 5.32%, and in West Germany, the 7% benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02%. 
16/wsj_1625:Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express, most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this.
16/wsj_1625:In a distressing number of cases, no.
16/wsj_1625:While the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for, it's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in "expenses" claimed by other operators, including fraudulent expenses.
16/wsj_1625:In many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries. 
16/wsj_1625:It's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs, high-living operators, and downright fraud.
16/wsj_1625:State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams, and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging. 
16/wsj_1625:The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year, measuring them against minimum standards for accountability; for accuracy and honesty in solicitation; and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established.
16/wsj_1625:The Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program.
16/wsj_1625:Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test. 
16/wsj_1625:Which, it should be added, doesn't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway.
16/wsj_1625:On this basis, "there's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one," says David Ormstedt, an assistant attorney general in Connecticut. "A lot of donors just get taken." 
16/wsj_1625:Including those, he contends, who put about $1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center.
16/wsj_1625:The state has sued these charities in state court, complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent; 82%, says Mr. Ormstedt, went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives -- for fur coats, trips to Florida, Lucullan restaurant tabs.
16/wsj_1625:Running a charity does cost money, but reputable organizations manage to get the lion's share of donations out to where they are really needed.
16/wsj_1625:The Arthritis Foundation, the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90% of their income on programs, not overhead.
16/wsj_1625:The state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago, along with Telesystems Marketing Inc., its Houston-based fund raiser. 
16/wsj_1625:Michael Burns, president of Telesystems, says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case, noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children's.
16/wsj_1625:Enforcers can't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion's share of their income on fund raising.
16/wsj_1625:State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income -- usually half -- that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead, but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.
16/wsj_1625:It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising, which would amount to limiting the charities' first-amendment right to freedom of expression. 
16/wsj_1625:This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation, and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently.
16/wsj_1625:The attorney general's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years, and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere. 
16/wsj_1625:Illinois, for instance, currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there. 
16/wsj_1625:Attorneys general in several states, including Illinois, are already suing Watson & Hughey Co., an Alexandria, Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America. 
16/wsj_1625:According to the Illinois attorney general's suit, Watson & Hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes, and could win up to an additional $1,000 on top of them, if they contributed as little as $7.
16/wsj_1625:But the total value of the prizes was only $5,000 and most "winners" will receive just 10 cents, according to the attorney general's office.
16/wsj_1625:While they can target some of the most obvious miscreants, enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface.
16/wsj_1625:"All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as, `Don't smoke!' or `Wear suntan lotion, ' " says William Webster, attorney general of Missouri. "By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations, hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters." 
16/wsj_1625:Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest, best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs.
16/wsj_1625:The established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it. "We can't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name.
16/wsj_1625:Most of them don't last for long, but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they aren't connected with us," says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association.
16/wsj_1625:A couple in Rockford, Ill., raised $12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, without permission from the group.
16/wsj_1625:MADD didn't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for $613, along with a letter saying that was the charity's "share." 
16/wsj_1625:Overhead costs at some of the largest charities, in millions of dollars 
16/wsj_1626:British Airways PLC, a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp., washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of United Airlines. 
16/wsj_1626:The carrier stopped short of saying it wouldn't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for UAL. However, company officials said they plan to take "no initiatives" to resurrect the transaction, and "aren't aware" of any restructured bid in the making. 
16/wsj_1626:The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last Friday, with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place. 
16/wsj_1626:UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, who is leading the management end of the buy-out, hasn't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal. 
16/wsj_1626:In another setback yesterday, United's machinist union asked the Treasury Department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws.
16/wsj_1626:Still, without the assurance of British Airways' financial backing, it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid, especially since British Air's original investment represented 78% of the cash equity contribution for the bid. 
16/wsj_1626:UAL stock dropped $1.625 yesterday to $190.125 on volume of 923,500 shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
16/wsj_1626:The carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its American counterparts. "The {buy-out} consortium ceased to exist because our American partners were not capable of organizing the financing," a British Air spokesman said. 
16/wsj_1626:British Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the Transportation Department forced Northwest's Airlines' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in that carrier.
16/wsj_1626:Most of the department's statements since the Northwest transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in U.S. carriers. 
16/wsj_1626:They also unanimously re-elected Mr. Dubinsky, the union chairman who has led the pilots' 2 1/2-year fight to take control of the airline. 
16/wsj_1627:The June increase compared with a rise of 10.5% in May from a year earlier. 
16/wsj_1627:Sales of capital goods to foreign and domestic destinations increased 16.6% in the January-June period from a year earlier.
16/wsj_1627:Sales of consumer goods rose 6.9% in the same period, while sales of intermediate goods were up 13.8% from a year ago. 
16/wsj_1628:Senate Democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided, under pressure from their leaders, not to offer their own proposal, placing another obstacle in the path of President Bush's legislative priority. 
16/wsj_1628:A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets.
16/wsj_1628:But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut, called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday.
16/wsj_1628:Afterward, leaders of the dissident Democrats relented, and said they wouldn't offer their own proposal as they had planned. 
16/wsj_1628:The decision is a setback for President Bush, who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled Senate.
16/wsj_1628:Still, Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment, predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year.
16/wsj_1628:He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect. 
16/wsj_1628:The House version of the bill does include the tax cut. 
16/wsj_1628:Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill, perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation.
16/wsj_1628:The president apparently will have only one bill to push, Sen. Packwood's, and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it. "I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor," said Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), a leader of those Democrats. 
16/wsj_1628:The Packwood plan, as expected, would allow individuals to exclude from income 5% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year.
16/wsj_1628:The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held, until it reached a maximum of 35% after seven years.
16/wsj_1628:For corporations, the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33% from the current top rate of 34%.
16/wsj_1628:The Roth plan would create a new, non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement, but also for the purchase of a first home, education expenses and medical expenses.
16/wsj_1629:Westmoreland Coal Co., realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity, reported sharply improved third-quarter results. 
16/wsj_1629:The producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said net income for the quarter was $5.9 million, or 71 cents a share, on revenue of $145.4 million.
16/wsj_1629:For the year-earlier period, the company reported a loss of $520,000 or six cents a share. 
16/wsj_1629:Last year's net loss of $3,524,000 included a benefit of $1,640,000 from an accounting change.
16/wsj_1629:Westmoreland's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region.
16/wsj_1629:Westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage, including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas. 
16/wsj_1629:For the past couple of years, Westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business.
16/wsj_1629:The size of the company's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13.
16/wsj_1629:About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated.
16/wsj_1629:For example, the chief executive himself now pays 20% of the cost of his health benefits; the company used to pay 100%. 
16/wsj_1629:"I think the ship is now righted, the bilges are pumped and we are on course," Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program. "Much of what we set out to do is completed." 
16/wsj_1629:But he cautioned that Westmoreland's third quarter is typically better than the fourth, so investors "shouldn't just multiply the third quarter by four" and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained.
16/wsj_1629:One difference, he said, is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season. 
16/wsj_1629:Nevertheless, Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be "solidly profitable" for Westmoreland and that 1990 would bring "more of the same." For all of 1988, the company reported an after-tax operating loss of $134,000 on revenue of $593.5 million.
16/wsj_1629:Some of the coal the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines.
16/wsj_1629:Mr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit's contribution to company results in the 1990s "will be exciting." He said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the Mississippi River. 
16/wsj_1629:Westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5% range in the early 1990s. "We see coal's piece of the action growing," Mr. Hutchinson said. "Coal prices, while not skyrocketing, will grow modestly in real terms, we think." 
16/wsj_1630:Chase had purchased an option to buy the building at One New York Plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late Sol Atlas as part of its original lease in 1970. 
16/wsj_1630:Of that amount, $20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself. 
16/wsj_1630:The building houses about 4,500 Chase workers, most of whom will be moved to downtown Brooklyn after the bank's new back office center is completed in 1993.
16/wsj_1630:The move is part of Chase's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof.
16/wsj_1630:As part of its decision to leave the building, Chase tried to sell its interest, along with the Atlas estate's interest, shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash.
16/wsj_1630:Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations.
16/wsj_1630:Chase is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space, and Salomon Brothers Inc., whose headquarters is in the building, also plans to move shortly.
16/wsj_1630:In addition, another major building tenant, Thomson McKinnon Inc. 's Thomson McKinnon Securities, likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation. 
16/wsj_1630:New York real estate brokerage Edward S. Gordon Co. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants.
16/wsj_1630:Even with its striking views of the New York harbor, the building is considered antiquated by modern office standards.
16/wsj_1631:The author of the futuristic novel "1984" invented a language called Newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought -- that is, anything negative about the policies and practices of the state.
16/wsj_1631:When something undeniably nasty happens, a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear, much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers. 
16/wsj_1631:According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market, it never happened.
16/wsj_1631:In the "technical correction" of two years ago, they lost a whopping 22.6%.) 
16/wsj_1631:Customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock.
16/wsj_1631:Either way, the word "broker" is clearly out of favor. 
16/wsj_1631:Of the major New York-based securities firms, only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers.
16/wsj_1631:Such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified, broad-scale competence and expertise in selling today's myriad financial products.
16/wsj_1631:The names of some of these products don't suggest the risk involved in buying them, either. 
16/wsj_1631:Indeed, conservative investors, many of them elderly, have poured more than $50 billion into such funds, which promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds -- only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options, a gambler's game. 
16/wsj_1631:When a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished, look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker.
16/wsj_1631:This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships, many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments.
16/wsj_1631:Getting out of them, however, may be a different story now. 
16/wsj_1631:In recent years, though, a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6% -- when an investor sells his shares.
16/wsj_1631:And don't expect anyone to change the term "blue chip," either, even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were.
16/wsj_1631:American Telephone & Telegraph Co., for one, is still a favorite of widows, orphans and trust departments -- but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side, it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture. 
16/wsj_1631:Larry Biehl, a money manager in San Mateo, Calif., blames that on the advent of program trading, in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail.
16/wsj_1631:Before the takeover mania of the '80s, it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks, especially those with shrewd management, sound fundamentals and decent prospects.
16/wsj_1631:Now, says Mr. Biehl, value investing often means "looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble." To institutional investors or brokers, he adds, a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up. 
16/wsj_1632:-- During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and "Use of Proceeds" confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made. 
16/wsj_1632:-- The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings (and management bonuses); the price, a sea of bad loans. 
16/wsj_1633:Gillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to its board, increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11. 
16/wsj_1633:Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought $600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11% stake, and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board. 
16/wsj_1633:Sales rose 9% to $921.6 million from $845.7 million, with sales of the company's international/diversified operations "well above" the year earlier-period. 
16/wsj_1634:When Walter Yetnikoff, the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records, last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a $3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio, Mr. Guber jumped at the chance. 
16/wsj_1634:And before the week was out, Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner, Jon Peters, the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business.
16/wsj_1634:Not only that, Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia's future profits and buy their company, Guber Peters Entertainment Co., for $200 million, almost 40% more than the market value of the company. 
16/wsj_1634:Just seven months earlier, they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for Warner Bros. for which they had just produced the smash hit "Batman." But Mr. Guber figured that Warner Communications Inc. chairman Steven Ross, would empathize and let the producers go, knowing the Sony offer was "the culmination of a life's work." 
16/wsj_1634:Last week, following fruitless settlement talks, Warner, now merging with Time Inc., filed a $1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters.
16/wsj_1634:The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides: As one Sony executive puts it, "It's World War III." 
16/wsj_1634:That two successful producers who aren't all that well known outside Hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business.
16/wsj_1634:He is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees.
16/wsj_1634:And despite their share of duds, they make movies that make money. 
16/wsj_1634:After five years of management turmoil, with four different studio heads, Columbia sorely needs a stable, savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits. 
16/wsj_1634:Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a "Flashdance," or buy rights to a best seller such as "The Color Purple." It falls to others to do the writing, directing and producing. 
16/wsj_1634:"They're the best production talent around," says Brian De Palma, beholden to Guber Peters for hiring him to direct the Warner movie of Tom Wolfe's novel "Bonfire of the Vanities." On that film, which is to start shooting in a few months, "they've been very much involved, hiring talent and discussing the development of the script.
16/wsj_1634:Warner executives blame Mr. Guber's and Mr. Peters's lack of involvement in "Caddyshack II" for casting and production problems and the film's ultimate dismal failure. "We've had a few bombs," admits Mr. Peters. "But by and large this company has only been profitable." He says his company's prowess at packaging and marketing "is why we'll be good at Columbia.
16/wsj_1634:We practically ran our own studio." Longtime Hollywood associates describe Mr. Guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two, a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing. "Peter is a major piece of Hollywood manpower who has really earned his success," says Robert Bookman, an agent at Creative Artists Agency.
16/wsj_1634:Mark Johnson, the producer of "Rainman," chimes in: "He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority. . . . It's no accident that they've been able to develop such successful material." 
16/wsj_1634:Mr. Peters, on the other hand, has fewer fans in Hollywood, and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully.
16/wsj_1634:Thrice married but now single, Mr. Peters got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress Kim Basinger during the making of "Batman." Mr. Guber, by contrast, has been married to one woman for more than 20 years.
16/wsj_1634:But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences, they make the perfect "good cop, bad cop" team, Hollywood associates say. "Peter is the bright, sympathetic guy when you're doing a deal," says one agent. "If there's a problem, Peter disappears, and all of a sudden Jon shows up." 
16/wsj_1634:We are the producers of that movie.
16/wsj_1634:They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit" as executive producers. 
16/wsj_1634:When Roger Birnbaum, an executive who worked for Guber Peters in the early 1980s, left to take a job as head of production at the United Artists studio, they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop, including "Rainman" and "Batman." Mr. Peters acknowledges that and says it's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner. "I was upset with Roger, I fumpered and schmumpered," says Mr. Peters. "But he wanted to pursue his own dream, and he went." 
16/wsj_1634:Still, Mr. Birnbaum says his relationship with Guber Peters was "one of the most successful I've had in Hollywood." The two "have a wonderful chemistry -- Jon is very impulsive, and Peter is very compulsive," adds Mr. Birnbaum, who is now head of production at News Corp. 's 20th Century Fox Film Co. "Jon Peters will come barreling into a room, say he's got a great idea, and be gone.
16/wsj_1634:Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific. . . ." 
16/wsj_1634:Mr. Birnbaum recalls that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey, which became "Gorillas in the Mist." He says, "Within a few weeks, we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey.
16/wsj_1634:More recently, Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers, reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner, for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes, the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest.
16/wsj_1634:Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man's widow for months, showing her a tape of "Gorillas in the Mist" to impress her with the quality of their work.
16/wsj_1634:Ultimately, they paid more than $1 million for the rights. (The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband's followers.
16/wsj_1634:Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation, but it isn't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest.) 
16/wsj_1634:But though "people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters, it's good to have a partner, and obviously the chemistry works," says Steven Tisch, a producer who once worked for Mr. Guber. "This business isn't about personalities at the end of the day -- its about whether the ink is red or black.
16/wsj_1634:In the case of Peter and Jon, the ink has been very, very black." 
16/wsj_1634:Recruited from New York University's MBA program, he rose within two years to head of production, overseeing such films as "The Way We Were," "Taxi Driver," "Tommy" and "Shampoo." In 1976, he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks -- later called Polygram Pictures -- where they produced such hits as as "The Deep," and "Midnight Express." 
16/wsj_1634:In 1980, Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters, by then a successful producer in his own right, after the death of Mr. Bogart.
16/wsj_1634:While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others, their record wasn't always so impressive.
16/wsj_1634:Among their clinkers were "The Legend of Billie Jean," "VisionQuest," "Clue" and "Clan of the Cave Bear." And the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates.
16/wsj_1634:Mr. Guber replies that "this is a Goliath, this Time Warner, trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time." 
16/wsj_1634:Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters maintain that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse, but that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony. "From the beginning, {they} knew we had a goal and a dream," says Mr. Guber.
16/wsj_1634:On a number of occasions, he adds, he tried to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright. "They always listened, but they never acted," Mr. Guber says. 
16/wsj_1634:Guber, Peters and Sugarman made a $100 million offer to buy 25% of MGM/UA.
16/wsj_1634:The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind, both financially and in terms of creative freedom.
16/wsj_1634:But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month: the chance, at last, to run a major studio, about $50 million in deferred compensation, up to 10% of Columbia's future cash flow, 8% of the future appreciation of Columbia's market value, and annual salaries of $2.7 million for each.
16/wsj_1634:The producers' 28% share of publicly held Guber Peters would net them an additional $50 million.
16/wsj_1634:Sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $42 million last year.
16/wsj_1634:In the the latest quarter, thanks in part to "Batman," Guber Peters earned $5.8 million, or 50 cents a share, compared to a loss of $6.8 million, or 62 cents a share, in last year's quarter.
16/wsj_1634:The two sides now are accusing each other of lying.
16/wsj_1634:Warner, in its court filings, calls it "a piece of fiction created for this litigation." 
16/wsj_1634:Moreover, the old contract was about to expire, and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner wasn't as strong as it is now.
16/wsj_1634:At the very least, Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony.
16/wsj_1634:In any settlement, Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years, notably sequels to "Batman." 
16/wsj_1634:And they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts.
16/wsj_1635:The assets backing the securities come from some of the country's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions.
16/wsj_1635:Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues.
16/wsj_1635:And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation's biggest institutional investors. 
16/wsj_1635:The concept may be simple: Take a bunch of loans, tie them up in one neat package, and sell pieces of the package to investors.
16/wsj_1635:"A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters," says Owen Carney, director of the investment securities division of the U.S. comptroller of the currency. "We don't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn." 
16/wsj_1635:Such concerns, however, haven't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street's hottest new products.
16/wsj_1635:Since the spring of 1985, financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities. 
16/wsj_1635:They have offered bundles of homeequity loans, as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares.
16/wsj_1635:Last year, there was an issue of "death-backed bonds" -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders.
16/wsj_1635:"This is the heyday of debt," says James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a newsletter. "Before the sun sets on the '80s, it seems nothing will be left unhocked." 
16/wsj_1635:That includes more than $9.5 billion issued through August of this year, up sharply from $6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period -- and more than in all of 1987. 
16/wsj_1635:The entry fee is affordable: Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $1,000. 
16/wsj_1635:"We expect additional offerings" of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors, says Bill Addiss, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
16/wsj_1635:The process typically begins when an institution, such as Citibank or Sears, Roebuck & Co., takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust.
16/wsj_1635:Issues typically come with "credit enhancements," such as a bank letter of credit, and thus have received high credit ratings. 
16/wsj_1635:Enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers, while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions.
16/wsj_1635:Asset-backed securities "are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds," says Craig J. Goldberg, managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 
16/wsj_1635:Consider a $500 million offering of 9% securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables.
16/wsj_1635:The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues.
16/wsj_1635:On a $10,000 investment, that's a difference of only $50 a year. 
16/wsj_1635:That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street.
16/wsj_1635:"If you're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby, then even an extra 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) becomes an important consideration on a career basis," says Mr. Grant. "But if you're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again, then that isn't of overwhelming importance." 
16/wsj_1635:That's why some investment managers, such as Alex Powers, a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank's private banking division, don't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states, such as New York or California. 
16/wsj_1635:That's particularly true, analysts say, for certain of the securities, such as those backed by time-share loans. "You could see massive gyrations here because it's such a thinly traded market," says Jonathan S. Paris, a vice president of European Investors Inc., a New York investment-management firm. 
16/wsj_1635:In addition, an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds, or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange, can simply check newspaper listings.
16/wsj_1635:The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and "do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks, Citibank N.A., Citicorp or any affiliate thereof." In other words, if there's a problem, don't expect Citibank to come to the rescue.
16/wsj_1635:That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities, as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received.
16/wsj_1635:Take the "credit enhancements," which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company.
16/wsj_1635:The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities.
16/wsj_1635:Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue.
16/wsj_1635:If a bank's credit rating was lowered because of, say, its loans to Third World nations, that could also affect the ratings, liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports. 
16/wsj_1635:Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues.
16/wsj_1635:"A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues, and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds," says Craig Corcoran of Davis/Zweig Futures Inc., an investment advisory firm. 
16/wsj_1635:And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., of what he calls "DeVoe's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1: 
16/wsj_1635:"More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations, scams and frauds of all time." 
16/wsj_1635:Volume of asset-backed securities issued annually 
16/wsj_1635:**As of August 30 
16/wsj_1636:Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc., serious investors have taken that advice to heart.
16/wsj_1636:For example, about 88% of Journal readers owned stock (down slightly from 91% in a similar poll last year).
16/wsj_1636:Similarly, 57% of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund, and 33% own municipal bonds.
16/wsj_1636:But only 6% to 7% of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives. 
16/wsj_1636:The poll, conducted Aug. 7-28, also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics.
16/wsj_1636:Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire, 951 replied.
16/wsj_1636:The response rate, more than 63%, allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence.
16/wsj_1636:Journal readers are relatively affluent, with a median household income of between $75,000 and $99,000.
16/wsj_1636:Nearly half of the respondents (47%) said their investment portfolio was worth $250,000 or more, and 17% said it was worth $1 million or more. 
16/wsj_1636:For example, 12% of this year's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months.
16/wsj_1636:An additional 56% of this year's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months.
16/wsj_1636:Only 42% of last year's respondents anticipated slowing growth. 
16/wsj_1636:By contrast, only 32% expect an increase in the price of gold.
16/wsj_1636:But the lurking shadow of 1987's stock-market crash still seems dark.
16/wsj_1636:About 60% of them said they would "ordinarily" have at least 25% of their money in stocks.
16/wsj_1636:But as of August, only 50% actually had stock-market investments of that size. 
16/wsj_1636:Most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll.
16/wsj_1637:Canadian steel ingot production totaled 276,334 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 14, down 5.3% from the preceding week's total of 291,890 tons, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said. 
16/wsj_1638:The real estate investment trust said that it leased the three Florida facilities to National Health Care Affiliates Inc. of Buffalo, N.Y. 
16/wsj_1639:Moody's Investors Service said it lowered its rating on about $75 million of this Chatsworth, Calif., concern's convertible subordinated debentures, due 2012, to Caa from B2.
16/wsj_1639:It said the reduction reflects impaired business prospects and reduced financial flexibility caused by continuing losses at the maker of Winchester disk drives. 
16/wsj_1639:VALLEY National Corp. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on about $400 million of this bank holding company's senior debt to B2 from Ba3.
16/wsj_1639:Moody's said it expects Valley National, of Phoenix, Ariz., to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio, and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets, and from high loan-loss provisions. 
16/wsj_1640:That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage. "Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies," said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md. 
16/wsj_1640:It "may well be" that theft of business data is "as serious a strategic threat to national security" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs. 
16/wsj_1640:The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group. 
16/wsj_1640:Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year, most aren't yet taking precautions, the experts said.
16/wsj_1640:One expert, whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he wouldn't be named or quoted, said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers, for example, doubling as foreign spies. 
16/wsj_1640:He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read.
16/wsj_1640:W. Mark Goode, president of Micronyx Inc., a Richardson, Texas, firm that makes computer-security products, provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign for greater openness, known commonly as glasnost.
16/wsj_1640:He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East.
16/wsj_1641:The University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp. 
16/wsj_1641:It said $10 million would go to the University of Toronto. 
16/wsj_1641:Ciba-Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of C$866 million for Connaught, and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of C$942 million.
16/wsj_1641:It said the new agreement would "replace" the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover. "Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught, this accord would enhance research and development in Canada," said James Keffer, the university's vice president of research. 
16/wsj_1641:In a statement, Jacques-Francois Martin, director general of Merieux, said the French company is still determined to acquire Connaught.
16/wsj_1642:Microsoft and other software stocks surged, leading the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks to its biggest advance of the year on breathtaking volume. 
16/wsj_1642:Leading the pack, Microsoft soared 3 3/4, or 4%, to a record price of 84 1/4 on 1.2 million shares.
16/wsj_1642:The transportation and insurance sectors each posted gains of 8.59, with the transports finishing at 486.74 and the insurers at 537.91.
16/wsj_1642:The Nasdaq industrial index climbed 8.17 to 458.52, and the "other finance" index, made up of commercial banks and real estate and brokerage firms, rose 3.97 to 545.96.
16/wsj_1642:The index of smaller banks improved 1.97. 
16/wsj_1642:Of the 4,346 issues that changed hands, 1,435 rose and 629 fell.
16/wsj_1642:Jeremiah Mullins, head of OTC trading at Dean Witter Reynolds, said both institutional and retail investors were buying.
16/wsj_1642:But there was a dearth of sellers, traders said, so buyers had to bid prices up to entice them. 
16/wsj_1642:Microsoft's surge followed a report this week of substantially improved earnings for its first quarter, ended Sept. 30.
16/wsj_1642:Caere, a new software issue, surged from its offering price of 12 to close at 16 1/8.
16/wsj_1642:The operator of fast-food restaurants, whose shares began trading last Friday, climbed 3 1/8 to 23 on 944,000 shares.
16/wsj_1642:Valley National's slide of 5 3/4 points to 18 1/2 on 4.2 million shares followed its report late Wednesday of a $72.2 million third-quarter loss.
16/wsj_1642:Additionally, Moody's Investors Service said it downgraded Valley National's senior debt and confirmed the company's commercial paper rating of "not prime." 
16/wsj_1642:The offering was for about 2.8 million shares of the data storage equipment maker; more than 2.2 million shares changed hands after trading began. 
16/wsj_1642:The company said earnings for the year ending Jan. 28, 1990, are expected to be 25 to 35 cents a share, compared with a previous estimate of 50 to 60 cents a share. 
16/wsj_1643:Row 21 of Section 9 of the Upper Reserved at Candlestick Park is a lofty perch, only a few steps from the very top of the stands.
16/wsj_1643:From my orange seat, I looked over the first-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the World Series. 
16/wsj_1643:And it didn't have the crowded wild intimacy of Yankee Stadium.
16/wsj_1643:But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me, liked it that they'd brought their children, found it charming that, true citizens of the state of the future, they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event. 
16/wsj_1643:Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history.
16/wsj_1643:The day was saturated with the weight of its own impending history.
16/wsj_1643:Long lines of people waited to buy special souvenir World Series postcards with official postmarks.
16/wsj_1643:Thousands of us had paid $5 for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on Series trivia, its historical photographs of great moments in Series past, and its instructions, in English and Spanish, for filling in the scorecard.
16/wsj_1643:Only at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what was going on.
16/wsj_1643:Then I remembered the quake of '71, which I experienced in Santa Barbara in a second-story motel room.
16/wsj_1643:When the swaying of the building woke me up, I reasoned that a) I was in Southern California; b) the bed was moving; c) it must be a Magic Fingers bed that had short-circuited.
16/wsj_1643:Get out of the possibly collapsing building to the parking lot.
16/wsj_1643:At the Stick, while the world shook, I thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different.
16/wsj_1643:I was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment.
16/wsj_1643:All these thoughts raced through my head in the 15 seconds of the earthquake's actual duration.
16/wsj_1643:The rest is, of course, history.
16/wsj_1643:And most of us waited for a while for the game to start.
16/wsj_1643:It was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the Stick that I really understood the point of all those Walkmen and Watchmen.
16/wsj_1643:Within 15 minutes of the quake itself, I was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the Bay Bridge.
16/wsj_1643:Increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before I got to my car.
16/wsj_1643:And by then, expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the gridlocked parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black plume of smoke we saw on the northern horizon. 
16/wsj_1643:But the broadcasts continued through the blacked-out night, with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in Oakland and firefighting in the Marina district.
16/wsj_1643:By then, our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of listeners and viewers. 
16/wsj_1643:In fact, the entire population of the Bay Area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience.
16/wsj_1643:The reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters. 
16/wsj_1643:The outstanding example of this was the motorist on the Bay Bridge who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway.
16/wsj_1644:The first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank, except for the page numbers.
16/wsj_1644:The plunge made Shearson's market commentary instantly out of date. 
16/wsj_1644:In fact, last Friday's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise, not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week.
16/wsj_1644:Shearson, a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co., didn't have enough time to update its market commentary so, "We decided to kill our strategy pieces," says Jack Rivkin, the head of Shearson's research department. 
16/wsj_1644:Investors recalled that Shearson last week had been advising that "the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance." Many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views. 
16/wsj_1644:Both before and after the Friday plunge, Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65% stocks, 20% bonds and 15% cash. 
16/wsj_1645:Sheldon B. Lubar, chairman of Lubar & Co., and John L. Murray, chairman of Universal Foods Corp., were elected to the board of this engine maker.
16/wsj_1646:Unless the government suddenly reverses course, wages for most workers won't keep pace with inflation, creating a potential source of urban unrest. 
16/wsj_1646:Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt.
16/wsj_1646:Rather, the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private "township" enterprises, which have fallen into disfavor as China's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership. 
16/wsj_1646:Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major Communist Party plenum for sometime in the next few weeks.
16/wsj_1646:But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing, some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy. 
16/wsj_1646:That would benefit Chinese enterprises as well as Sino-foreign joint ventures, both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital.
16/wsj_1646:A dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens, if unchecked, to bring the economy to a collapse. 
16/wsj_1646:One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of People's Bank of China, the central bank, to allocate $5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest, the official China Daily reported. 
16/wsj_1646:But while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries, it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation.
16/wsj_1646:The statistical bureau's report, cited in China Daily, notes that industrial output in September totaled $29.4 billion, a rise of just 0.9% from a year earlier.
16/wsj_1646:Production in Shanghai, China's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government, fell 1.8% for the month. 
16/wsj_1646:Nationwide, output of light industrial products declined 1.8% -- "the first decline in 10 years," a bureau spokesman told China Daily. 
16/wsj_1647:The 1986 tax overhaul, the biggest achievement of President Reagan's second term, is beginning to fall apart, and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over Capitol Hill. 
16/wsj_1647:And heavy-industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax credit. 
16/wsj_1647:Adds Robert Juliano, the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses: "It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again." 
16/wsj_1647:Other fundamental "reforms" of the 1986 act have been threatened as well.
16/wsj_1647:As part of the same bill, the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations, in what committee member Sen. David Pryor (D., Ark.) calls a "feeding frenzy" of special-interest legislating.
16/wsj_1647:To be sure, the full Senate, facing a fast-approaching budget deadline, last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill.
16/wsj_1647:But lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary.
16/wsj_1647:Other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts, including both the capital-gains and IRA provisions. 
16/wsj_1647:"There isn't any doubt that the thread of the '86 code has been given a mighty tug," says Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.). "You'll see the annual unraveling of it." 
16/wsj_1647:"It's back to tax-give-away time for the select few," says Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania, the third-ranking Democrat in the House.
16/wsj_1647:Referring to the chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees, he adds, "Next year, every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on Lloyd Bentsen's door, on Danny Rostenkowski's door." 
16/wsj_1647:Just last week, a House Ways and Means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities, companies and interest groups who want to open their own special loopholes. "It's a Swiss-cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good," commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings. 
16/wsj_1647:Even lobbyists for heavy industry, one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill, are encouraged.
16/wsj_1647:The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs "creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation (write-offs) or investment credits," says Paul Huard, a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers.
16/wsj_1647:Real-estate interests, for example, are protesting an omission in President Bush's capital-gains proposal: It doesn't include real-estate gains. "If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains, they certainly want to be part of it," says real-estate lobbyist Wayne Thevenot of Concord Associates. 
16/wsj_1647:But Sotheby's, Christie's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs.
16/wsj_1647:They have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment. "Collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets," the letter states. 
16/wsj_1647:All of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
16/wsj_1647:In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates, the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions, deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others.
16/wsj_1647:Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses, also known as passive losses, that made many tax shelters possible.
16/wsj_1647:This year Congress, with prodding from President Bush, has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code.
16/wsj_1647:It appears likely that, this year or next, some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted.
16/wsj_1647:One recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to San Francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of Chicago for the 30th reunion of St. Ignatius High School. "I'm too old to waste a weekend, but that's what I did," the 48-year-old Mr. Juliano moans. "These days, anything can happen." 
16/wsj_1648:Lufthansa AG said passenger volume climbed 5.2% for the first nine months of 1989 to 15.3 million passengers from 14.5 million passengers in the year-earlier period. 
16/wsj_1648:Load factor, or percentage of seats filled, climbed to 67.1% from 66.6%, even though the number of flights rose 6.9% to 215,845 in the first-three quarters. 
16/wsj_1649:Chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career.
16/wsj_1649:His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe, the inferior "Playback" (1958), at times read almost like a parody of his previous work.
16/wsj_1649:When he died in 1959, Chandler left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book, "The Poodle Springs Story," which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque. "Champ" Chandler's last pitch, apparently, was a screwball. 
16/wsj_1649:Now Robert Parker, author of several best sellers featuring Spenser, a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold, has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired to complete "The Poodle Springs Story." The result, "Poodle Springs" (Putnam's, 288 pages, $18.95) is an entertaining, easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle, full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color.
16/wsj_1649:As the book begins, a newly wed Marlowe roars into the desert resort of Poodle (a.k.a.
16/wsj_1649:Palm) Springs at the wheel of a Cadillac Fleetwood.
16/wsj_1649:His bride is the rich and beautiful Linda Loring, a character who also appeared in Chandler's "The Long Goodbye" and "Playback." Philip and Linda move into her mansion and can't keep their hands off each other, even in front of the Hawaiian/Japanese houseman.
16/wsj_1649:The supporting lineup is solid, the patter is amusing and there's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls, the "good cop" of previous Chandler books who still doesn't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes.
16/wsj_1649:All told, Mr. Parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect. 
16/wsj_1649:At one point, the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam -- and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro.
16/wsj_1649:Contact lenses, tank tops, prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s.
16/wsj_1650:Ko Shioya spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of Reader's Digest. "Japan has been a major importer of foreign information and news," says Mr. Shioya. "But one gets fed up with importing information and news." 
16/wsj_1650:Today, he is publisher of Business Tokyo magazine, the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business.
16/wsj_1650:Keizaikai is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing, after making major investments in entertainment, real estate and banking companies here.
16/wsj_1650:Japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers to study the U.S. market, including the New York-based investment banker Veronis, Suhler & Associates.
16/wsj_1650:"Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries," said John Veronis, chairman of Veronis Suhler.
16/wsj_1650:While there aren't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of Sony Corp. 's recent $3.4 billion agreement to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., observers don't rule out a transaction of that size. "The Japanese take the long view." said Mr. Veronis. "It may not be weeks or months, but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable, they will move on a deal," he said. 
16/wsj_1650:In recent months, three big Tokyo-based publishing concerns -- including Nikkei Business Publications, Nikkei Home (no relation), and Magazine House -- applied for membership in Magazine Publishers of America, which represents almost all U.S. consumer magazines. 
16/wsj_1650:The magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard, and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers. 
16/wsj_1650:Susumu Ohara, president of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc., publisher of the Japan Economic Journal, said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine. 
16/wsj_1650:"The Japanese are in the early stage right now," said Thomas Kenney, a onetime media adviser for First Boston Corp. who was recently appointed president of Reader's Digest Association's new Magazine Publishing Group. "Before, they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft.
16/wsj_1651:Denver-based U S West said net income dropped 8.9%, noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its BetaWest Properties unit. 
16/wsj_1651:"On a truly comparable basis, we've seen modest earnings growth this year from the operations of our company," said Jack MacAllister, chairman and chief executive officer. "The major negative factor was the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years." 
16/wsj_1651:Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic said net rose 6.5%, aided by strong growth in the network-services business and an increase in the number of new telephone lines. 
16/wsj_1651:Bell Atlantic added 148,000 new telephone lines in the quarter for a total of 16.9 million. 
16/wsj_1651:The company said per-share earnings were slightly reduced by the sale of 4.1 million shares of treasury stock to the company's newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plans. 
16/wsj_1651:At Nynex, net slumped 14.8%, primarily because of a continuing strike by 60,000 employees, lower-than-expected profit at its New York Telephone unit and significantly higher taxes and costs. 
16/wsj_1651:Most of the higher costs were associated with acquisitions and growth in nonregulated business units, it added. 
16/wsj_1651:The three-month-old strike at Nynex seriously hurt the installation of new telephone lines in the quarter.
16/wsj_1651:Nynex said access lines in service at the end of the quarter were off 18,000 from the previous quarter, which reported an increase of 160,000 new access lines. 
16/wsj_1651:Revenue rose to $3.31 billion from $3.18 billion, mostly from acquisition of AGS Computers and robust non-regulated businesses. 
16/wsj_1651:Walter H. Monteith Jr., SNET chairman and chief executive officer, said: "Innovative marketing of our products and services contributed to increase revenue." 
16/wsj_1651:San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis said net declined 12.6%, primarily because of regulatory action.
16/wsj_1651:Excluding the one-time charges, the company would have posted earnings of $298 million, or 73 cents a share.
16/wsj_1651:"This is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals," said Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive officer.
16/wsj_1651:Pacific Telesis said new telephone lines increased 4.5% for a total of about $13.5 million for the quarter; toll calls increased 9.6% to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion. 
16/wsj_1651:a-Includes a one-time gain of $88.7 million from a commonstock sale by U S West's U S West New Vector Group. b-Includes a $41.3 million gain on the sale of FiberCom. 
16/wsj_1652:A charge of $80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results.
16/wsj_1652:Generally in the quarter, overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability.
16/wsj_1652:Amoco's domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of $104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of $5 million, "primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices," said Chairman Richard M. Morrow.
16/wsj_1652:Amoco also sharply boosted natural-gas output, part of it from properties acquired from Tenneco Inc. last year. 
16/wsj_1653:James F. Gero, former chairman and chief executive officer of Varo Inc., and Richard J. Hatchett III, a Dallas investment banker, were elected directors of this medical-products concern, boosting the board to seven members. 
16/wsj_1654:"Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer," asserts Norman Abramson, president and chief operating officer of Clothestime Inc., an off-price chain. 
16/wsj_1654:This year, many stores are entering the Christmas season in turmoil: Bonwit Teller and B. Altman parent L.J. Hooker Corp. is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code; B.A.T Industries PLC's healthy Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's chains are on the auction block; Campeau's Bloomingdale's is also on the block. 
16/wsj_1654:Stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly, and to lose customers to stable chains such as Limited Inc., May Department Stores Co. and Dillard Department Stores Inc., which should do well. 
16/wsj_1654:But Mr. Steidtmann predicts that healthy stores hawking mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as 25% to 30%.
16/wsj_1654:More than 200 catalog outfits are promoting a low-cost Federal Express service that guarantees pre-Christmas delivery of orders made by a certain date. 
16/wsj_1654:"Traditionally, consumers were concerned about ordering after the first of December because they didn't believe they would get it by Christmas," says Adam Strum, chairman of the Wine Enthusiast Inc., which sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail.
16/wsj_1654:Philip M. Hawley, chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., expects sales at department stores open at least a year to rise a modest 3% to 5% over last year's totals, both for his company and the industry in general. "I'm not looking for a runaway Christmas at all," he says. 
16/wsj_1654:"It isn't a real boom holiday season in our eyes," says Woolworth Corp. Chairman Harold E. Sells, "but it isn't going to be a bust either." Mr. Sells expects fourth-quarter sales at his company -- which besides Woolworth stores includes Kinney and Foot Locker shoe stores and other specialty chains -- to rise "pretty much in line" with its year-to-date increases of between 8% and 9%.
16/wsj_1654:The estimate includes the results of new stores. 
16/wsj_1654:Of the 450 survey respondents, 35% said they expect to spend less buying Christmas gifts this year than last year, while 28% said they expect to spend more and 37% said their gift budget would stay the same.
16/wsj_1655:In Spain, anyway, the 73-year-old Mr. Cela enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books he wrote during the parched Franco years, the everyday poverty and stagnant atmosphere of which he described in brutally direct, vivid prose, beginning with "The Family of Pascal Duarte" (1942). 
16/wsj_1655:Unlike other writers who either battled the fascists during the Civil War, or left Spain when Franco triumphed, Mr. Cela fought briefly on the general's side, no doubt earning with his war wound some forbearance when he went on to depict a country with a high population of vagabonds, murderers and rural idiots trudging aimlessly through a dried-out land.
16/wsj_1655:Still, it was in Argentine editions that his countrymen first read his story of Pascal Duarte, a field worker who stabbed his mother to death and has no regrets as he awaits his end in a prison cell: "Fate directs some men down the flower-bordered path, and others down the road bordered with thistles and prickly pears.
16/wsj_1655:The lucky ones gaze out at life with serene eyes and smile with a face of innocence at their perfumed happiness.
16/wsj_1655:The others endure the hot sun of the plains and scowl like cornered wild beasts." 
16/wsj_1655:Mr. Cela himself was one of the lucky ones, his fortunes steadily increasing over the decades he spent putting out some 70 travelogues, novels, short story collections and poetry.
16/wsj_1655:Of his 10 novels, "The Hive" (1951), full of sharp vignettes of Madrid life and centered on a cafe run by Dona Rosa, a foul-mouthed, broad-based woman with blackened little teeth encrusted in filth, used to be available in English, translated by J.M. Cohen and published by Ecco Press, which now no doubt regrets relinquishing its copyright.
16/wsj_1655:The lonely woman walks on in the direction of the Plaza de Alonso Martinez.
16/wsj_1655:Two men have a conversation behind one of the windows of the cafe on the corner of the boulevard.
16/wsj_1655:The older one looks like a member of the jury for a literary award, the younger one looks like a novelist.
16/wsj_1655:It is evident that their conversation runs more or less on the following lines: "I've submitted the manuscript of my novel under the title `Teresa de Cepeda, ' and in it I've treated a few neglected aspects of that eternal problem which . . ." 
16/wsj_1655:Will you pour me a drop of water, if you don't mind?" 
16/wsj_1655:I don't know the quality of the works my colleagues have sent in, but in any case I feel confident that good sense and honest judgment . . ." 
16/wsj_1655:In passing the window, Senorita Elvira gives them a smile -- simply out of habit. 
16/wsj_1656:Ashland Oil Inc. said it will take after-tax charges of $78 million, or $1.40 a share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Sept. 30. 
16/wsj_1656:Because of the charge, Ashland expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and "significantly lower results" for fiscal 1989. 
16/wsj_1656:The company earned $66 million, or $1.19 a share, on revenue of $2.1 billion in the year-ago fourth quarter.
16/wsj_1656:For fiscal 1988, Ashland had net of $224 million, or $4.01 a share, on revenue of $7.8 billion.
16/wsj_1656:The charges consist of: a $25 million after-tax charge to cover cost overruns in Ashland's Riley Consolidated subsidiary; a previously announced $38 million after-tax charge resulting from a $325 million settlement with National Iranian Oil Co. and a $15 million after-tax charge from the previously announced sale of its Ashland Technology Corp. subsidiary.
16/wsj_1657:When President Bush arrives here next week for a hemispheric summit organized to commemorate a century of Costa Rican democracy, will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the Panamanian fiasco?
16/wsj_1657:The Panamanian affair is only the tip of a more alarming iceberg.
16/wsj_1657:It originates in a Bush administration decision not to antagonize the U.S. Congress and avoid, at all costs, being accused of meddling in the region.
16/wsj_1657:The result has been a dangerous vacuum of U.S. leadership, which leaves Central America open to Soviet adventurism. "The {influence of the} U.S. is not being felt in Central America; Washington's decisions do not respond to a policy, and are divorced from reality," says Fernando Volio, a Costa Rican congressman and former foreign minister. 
16/wsj_1657:The disarray of the Bush administration's Latin diplomacy was evident in the failure of the Organization of American States to condemn categorically Gen. Noriega.
16/wsj_1657:Faced with this embarrassment, U.S. diplomats expressed confidence that the influential Rio Group of South American nations, which gathered last week in Peru, would take a stronger posture toward the Panamanian dictator.
16/wsj_1657:Even Carlos Manuel Castillo -- the presidential candidate for Mr. Arias's National Liberation Party -- made public his opposition to the presence of Nicaragua "in a democratic festivity." 
16/wsj_1657:According to officials in Washington, the State Department hoped that by pleasing President Arias, it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the Contras until after Mr. Ortega's promises of democratic elections were tested next February.
16/wsj_1657:However, relying on an ardent critic of the Reagan administration and the Contra movement for help in delaying the disarming of the Contras was risky business.
16/wsj_1657:And even some last-minute phone calls that Mr. Bush made (at the behest of some conservative U.S. senators) to enlist backing for the U.S. position failed to stop the march of Mr. Arias's agenda. 
16/wsj_1657:Prior to this episode, Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), sensing an open field, undertook a personal diplomatic mission through Central America to promote an early disbanding of the rebels.
16/wsj_1657:In Honduras, where the Contras are a hot political issue, he promised to help unblock some $70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with Washington. 
16/wsj_1657:Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani; Mr. Cristiani's government is very much at the mercy of U.S. largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. Dodd's likes and dislikes.
16/wsj_1657:It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the U.S., virtually neglected by the Bush administration, ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by December, long before the elections.
16/wsj_1657:On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim "Nicaragua's great peace efforts." There, Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan: The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America.
16/wsj_1657:The Pentagon claims that in spite of Moscow's words, East bloc weapons continue to flow into Nicaragua through Cuba at near-record levels. 
16/wsj_1657:Furthermore, it is also likely to encourage those on Capitol Hill asking for cuts in the assistance to El Salvador if President Cristiani does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas. 
16/wsj_1657:The sad condition of U.S. policy in Central America is best depicted by the recent end to U.S. sponsorship of Radio Costa Rica.
16/wsj_1657:In 1984, the Costa Rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country, flooded by airwaves of Sandinista propaganda.
16/wsj_1657:Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of Radio Costa Rica, funded by the U.S. and affiliated with the Voice of America (VOA). 
16/wsj_1657:In the meantime, Russia gave Nicaragua another powerful radio transmitter, which has been installed in the city of Esteli.
16/wsj_1657:It is capable of reaching the entire Caribbean area and deep into North America.
16/wsj_1657:Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the Soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to U.S. default. 
16/wsj_1657:Questioned in Washington about what would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail, President Arias voiced expectations of direct U.S. action.
16/wsj_1657:A poll conducted in July by a Gallup affiliate showed that 64% of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either Nicaragua or Panama, the U.S. will come to its defense.
16/wsj_1657:But in the light of events in Panama, where the U.S. has such clear strategic interests, waiting for the Delta Force may prove to be a dangerous gambit. 
16/wsj_1658:Holiday Corp. said net income jumped 89%, partly on the strength of record operating income in its gaming division. 
16/wsj_1658:Separately, the hotel and gambling giant said it was proceeding with plans to make a tender offer and solicit consents with respect to approximately $1.4 billion of its publicly traded debt. 
16/wsj_1658:That debt is part of the $2.1 billion of Holiday debt that Bass PLC of Britain said it would retire or assume when it agreed to buy the Holiday Inn business in August. 
16/wsj_1658:Results for the quarter included $19.2 million in pretax gains from property transactions, including the sale of one Embassy Suites hotel, and $3.5 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the acquisition of the Holiday Inn business by Bass. 
16/wsj_1658:The debt issues involved and the proposed consent fees and cash tender offer prices (expressed per $1,000 of principal amount) are as follows: 10 1/2% senior notes due 1994 at 101%; 11% subordinated debt due 1999 at 102%; 9 3/8% notes due 1993 at 100%; and 8 3/8% notes due 1996 at 95.25%. 
16/wsj_1658:Holiday said its 15% notes due 1992 also will be included in the tender offer and consent solicitation at a price to be determined by Holiday prior to the commencement of the offer.
16/wsj_1658:Holiday said it intends to set the price to give noteholders approximately an 8.5% yield to the call date of Aug. 15, 
16/wsj_1659:The television units of Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. are exploring the possibility of offering prime-time programming to independent stations two nights a week, industry executives say. 
16/wsj_1659:Calls to Shelly Schwab, president of MCA TV, weren't returned. 
16/wsj_1659:One broadcasting executive familiar with the project said the co-venture would target stations affiliated with Fox because Fox has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities.
16/wsj_1659:Jamie Kellner, president of Fox Broadcasting, said, "We believe the partnership of Fox, its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow." 
16/wsj_1659:Another Fox official, who declined to be identified, said Fox wasn't pleased by the possible Paramount-MCA venture into prime-time programming. "To make the venture work, they would need Fox affiliates," he said. "We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations," he said, adding that Fox doesn't "appreciate" another company attempting to usurp its station lineup. 
16/wsj_1659:It is also planning another night of original series. 
16/wsj_1659:Paramount and MCA, according to the broadcasting executive, plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by Paramount and MCA for Wednesdays and perhaps a block of original shows Fridays. 
16/wsj_1659:"I think it's to Fox's advantage to be associated with the Paramount-MCA venture," said Michael Conway, station manager of WTXF, the TVX station that is a Fox affiliate.
16/wsj_1659:Michael Fisher, general manager of KTXL, a Fox affiliate in Sacramento, Calif., said, "The real question is whether the Paramount-MCA offering is practical.
16/wsj_1660:Under the agreement, BanPonce stockholders will be able to exchange each of their shares for either shares in the new entity or cash.
16/wsj_1660:The two companies, both based in San Juan, will form a bank holding company with assets of just over $9 billion.
16/wsj_1660:The primary subsidiary will be the combined banking operations of the two companies and will be known as Banco Popular de Puerto Rico. 
16/wsj_1660:Rafael Carrion Jr., chairman of Banco Popular, will be the chairman of the holding company.
16/wsj_1660:Alberto M. Paracchini, currently chairman of BanPonce, will serve as president of the bank holding company and chairman of the subsidiary. 
16/wsj_1660:Richard Carrion, who is currently president and chief executive officer of Banco Popular, said the merger will result in a "larger and stronger locally based bank." Mr. Carrion, who will now serve as president and chief executive officer of the subsidiary bank, added: "We'll be able to better compete with large foreign banks.
16/wsj_1660:The newly merged company will have 165 branches in Puerto Rico and 27 branches outside of the island.
16/wsj_1661:The company, which is in a costly modernization program, said earnings were hurt by higher start-up and new program costs, increased costs of materials, higher wages and an $11 million provision for bad debts in Latin America. 
16/wsj_1661:In announcing a 1989 capital spending plan of $950 million early this year, Caterpillar said full-year earnings would be flat compared with last year's $616 million, or $6.07 a share.

16/wsj_1663:Company officials say the flotations of the paper and British retailing businesses are likely only after the disposals of the U.S. retailing assets.

16/wsj_1664:Hasbro said it had net income of $31.3 million, or 53 cents a share, up from $18.1 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier, when it took a pretax charge of $10 million after dropping development of an interactive video entertainment system.
16/wsj_1664:Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive, added that Hasbro's new line of battery-powered racing cars, called Record Breakers, and its acquisition of Cabbage Patch Kids, Scrabble and other lines from Coleco Industries Inc. puts the company "in a good position as we enter the Christmas buying season."

16/wsj_1667:Steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the Nimitz Freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the double-decker highway last year by California's Department of Transportation, employees familiar with the project say. 
16/wsj_1667:The test project -- which reportedly survived Tuesday's earthquake -- was a prelude to a state plan to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings. 
16/wsj_1667:State engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns, wrenched and separated from the double-decker roadbed, that was responsible for the collapse. 
16/wsj_1667:The failure in Oakland of the freeway segment known as the Cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake, although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared. 
16/wsj_1667:Red tractors gingerly picked at the rubble while jackhammers tried to break up some of the massive slabs of concrete.
16/wsj_1667:Giant yellow cranes were wheeled up alongside the collapsed segment, preparing to lift off chunks of the debris. 
16/wsj_1667:In Sacramento, a transportation department spokesman said he couldn't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work.
16/wsj_1667:Moreover, other officials noted, snafus in transportation funding that the state has experienced over the years may have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting, even if it were technologically feasible. 
16/wsj_1667:Knowledgeable employees said the retrofitting, which hadn't yet been budgeted, was part of a planned, three-stage reinforcement of the Cypress structure begun by the California transportation department several years ago.
16/wsj_1667:The Cypress reinforcement project itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes.
16/wsj_1667:"We had just finished phase two" of the Cypress project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock, a state DOT engineer said.
16/wsj_1667:After completing installation of the jackets on "one frame" of the freeway last year, the state DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers to draw up a final design. 
16/wsj_1667:Knowledgeable employees said the project had been stymied somewhat by "the difficulty of designing" the jackets.
16/wsj_1667:The collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials.
16/wsj_1667:"I want to know who made the decision that it was safe for 186,000 people to use every day," said Richard Katz, a state legislator who is chairman of the California Assembly's transportation committee.
16/wsj_1667:The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake. 
16/wsj_1667:He said: "We know of no technology that exists anywhere in the world that would allow us to" reinforce the columns. 
16/wsj_1668:Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara said it rescheduled to Nov. 29 a special shareholder meeting to vote on a $75 million stock-for-debt exchange. 
16/wsj_1668:As part of a restructuring announced earlier this year, the company proposed in August to exchange 168 newly issued common shares for each $1,000 face value of debt.
16/wsj_1668:The debt consists of $50 million of 13 3/8% subordinated notes due 1998, and $25 million of 9% convertible subordinated debentures due 2012. 
16/wsj_1668:Financial Corp. also is proposing to exchange each of its 130,000 outstanding shares of cumulative convertible preferred series A stock for two shares of common. 
16/wsj_1669:After years of quarreling over Bonn's "Ostpolitik", West Germany and the U.S. appear to have shifted onto a united course in Eastern Europe. 
16/wsj_1669:Bonn and Washington have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries, pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit.
16/wsj_1669:West German officials also have the special goal of holding out hope for East Germany's fledgling reform movement. 
16/wsj_1669:Addressing a conference of the New York-based Institute for East-West Security Studies in Frankfurt yesterday, Mr. Genscher said, "History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities that emerge from these reforms." The ultimate aim of Western support for East bloc reforms, he said, is to create "an equitable and stable peaceful order in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals." 
16/wsj_1669:Mr. Genscher and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher, in separate speeches at the conference, appealed for more Western contributions to economic reforms and business development in Hungary and Poland.
16/wsj_1669:Bonn and Washington are leading supporters of Poland's request for a $1 billion stand-by credit from the International Monetary Fund. 
16/wsj_1669:"We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in Hungary and in Poland to succeed.
16/wsj_1669:U.S. curbs on the exports of sensitive technology to East bloc countries will remain in place, however. 
16/wsj_1669:Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday approved an $837.5 million aid package for Poland and Hungary that more than doubles the amount President Bush had requested.
16/wsj_1669:In addition, a group of 24 industrialized countries, including the U.S. and Japan and coordinated by the European Community Commission, has promised Poland and Hungary trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to $1.11 billion through the European Investment Bank, while the EC plans $222 million in direct aid. 
16/wsj_1669:When Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels to Poland Nov. 9, he is expected to take with him a promise of three billion West German marks ($1.6 billion) in new credit guarantees for industrial projects.
16/wsj_1669:Poland's plan to switch to a free-market economy by 1991 is hampered by a foreign debt load of $39.2 billion. 
16/wsj_1669:West Germany also has increased its credit guarantees to Hungary by 500 million marks to 1.5 billion marks as the emerging democratic state rushes through its own economic reforms, including a broad privatization of state-owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment.
16/wsj_1669:An additional 500 million marks in credit-backing was promised by the West German state governments of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg. 
16/wsj_1669:A maxim of Frankfurt banking holds that wherever Deutsche Bank goes, other West German banks follow.

16/wsj_1671:Now that the Supreme Court opened the door on the subject of abortion, politicians are squinting under the glare of democratic choice.
16/wsj_1671:Their discomfort is a healthy sign for the rest of us. 
16/wsj_1671:Much of Washington thought it detected George Bush in a characteristic waffle on abortion the past week.
16/wsj_1671:Only a month ago he'd warned Congress not to pass legislation to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest.
16/wsj_1671:When Democrats refused to budge, pro-life Republicans met at the White House with Chief of Staff John Sununu on Monday, and Mr. Bush quickly signaled a veto.
16/wsj_1671:Amid charges of "timidity" on Panama and elsewhere, the president wasn't about to offend his most energetic constituency. 
16/wsj_1671:Even such a pro-life stalwart as Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) had counseled some kind of compromise.
16/wsj_1671:The Senate passed the same bill yesterday, with a veto-proof majority of 67. 
16/wsj_1671:At the 1988 GOP convention, abortion was barely discussed at all, though delegates were evenly divided on the question of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment.
16/wsj_1671:Eddie Mahe, a Republican consultant, says the two GOP candidates could have avoided trouble if they had framed the issue first. (In Virginia, Marshall Coleman and his running mate, Eddy Dalton, are both on the defensive for opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest.) But Mr. Mahe adds, "The net loser in the next few years is the right-to-life side." 
16/wsj_1671:Darla St. Martin, of the National Right to Life Committee, says exit polls from the 1988 election had single-issue, pro-life voters giving Mr. Bush about five more percentage points of support than pro-choice voters gave Michael Dukakis.
16/wsj_1671:But the Supreme Court's opening of debate may have changed even that.
16/wsj_1671:GOP pollster Neil Newhouse, of the Wirthlin Group, says polls this summer showed that the single-issue voters had about evened out.
16/wsj_1671:Oklahoma official Robert Fulton lost a chance for a senior job in the Department of Health and Human Services after right-to-life activists opposed him.
16/wsj_1671:In the case of HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan, the litmus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the Republican coalition.
16/wsj_1671:It makes only a handful of abortion-related decisions.

Chicago Title & Trust acquired Safeco in 1987 and changed the unit's name to Security Union Title Insurance Co. 
16/wsj_1673:John Christie, a lawyer here for the two Chicago Title & Trust units accused the FTC of "second-guessing" state-level regulations, with which, he said, his clients had complied. "I expect all the companies to appeal," he added. 
16/wsj_1673:A lawyer for Lawyers Title said that, because the named companies no longer use the type of cooperative rating bureaus attacked by the FTC, the commission's order won't have much practical impact.
16/wsj_1674:MARK RESOURCES INC., Calgary, Alberta, said it agreed to sell 75 million Canadian dollars (US$63.9 million) of 8% convertible debentures to a group of securities dealers.

16/wsj_1684:Ever since the hotly contested America's Cup race last year, the famous yachting match has run into more rough sailing out of the water than in it.
16/wsj_1684:Now that a key member of the San Diego Yacht Club team is splitting off to form his own team, even more competition lies ahead. 
16/wsj_1684:Peter Isler, the winning navigator in the past two America's Cup challenges, has split from the team led by Dennis Conner, skipper of the victorious Stars & Stripes, to form his own team for the next contest in 1992.

16/wsj_1684:Now, the first order of business is raising enough money to keep his team afloat -- a new yacht will cost about $3 million alone, and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to $25 million for a Cup challenge. 
16/wsj_1684:The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the San Diego Yacht Club should be allowed to keep the international trophy for sailing a catamaran against the New Zealand challengers' 90-foot monohull.
16/wsj_1684:But because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the suit, Mr. Conner's team has done little to begin gearing up to defend its title. 
16/wsj_1684:"If you don't know what the rules of the game are, it's hard to start your fund-raising or design," said Dana Smith, an official with Team Dennis Conner.
16/wsj_1684:But spokesmen for both Mr. Isler and Mr. Conner say the formation of the new syndicate has to do with Mr. Isler's desire to skipper his own team and begin planning now, rather than any falling out between the two sportsmen.
16/wsj_1685:Missouri farmer Blake Hurst writing in the fall issue of the Heritage Foundation's Policy Review about the proposed location of a hazardous-waste incinerator in his county: 
16/wsj_1685:Of course I'd rather have a computer software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator.
16/wsj_1685:But I'd also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms I've seen (and smelt) in these parts.
16/wsj_1685:A community of abandoned farmsteads, failing businesses, and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one. . . . The loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural Missouri is hardly of national importance except for this: If the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem cannot be built in Atchinson County, what hope have we for dealing with the wastes our economy produces?
16/wsj_1685:After all, farmers here work with "hazardous" chemicals every day, many of them the same chemicals that would have been destroyed in the incinerator.
16/wsj_1686:Just because Stamford, Conn., High School did nothing when its valuable 1930s mural was thrown in the trash doesn't mean the city no longer owns the work of art, a federal judge ruled. 
16/wsj_1686:In 1986, Stamford officials thanked Mr. Hoelzer for taking care of the mural -- and demanded he return it as soon as possible.
16/wsj_1686:But Judge Louis L. Stanton of federal court in Manhattan ruled that the city couldn't be faulted for waiting too long because it didn't realize until 1986 that its ownership of the painting was in dispute.
16/wsj_1686:She said the mural "preserves an era in Stamford and in our country when this type of work was being done." 
16/wsj_1687:The prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the Soviet Union is keeping up its dizzying October buying binge of U.S. corn. 
16/wsj_1687:Those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the U.S. Agriculture Department announced that the Soviets had bought 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn, bringing their U.S. corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons. 
16/wsj_1687:In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the corn contract for December delivery jumped 5.75 cents a bushel to settle at $2.44 a bushel. 
16/wsj_1687:The Soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected the Soviet Union to buy this fall, the season in which it usually buys much of the corn it imports from the U.S.
16/wsj_1687:One sign that more Soviet purchases are possible is that U.S. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts.
16/wsj_1687:By some estimates, several grain companies combined bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn.
16/wsj_1687:By buying futures contracts, these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver. 
16/wsj_1687:Rumors of Soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts.
16/wsj_1687:Among other things, the Agriculture Department is widely thought to be mulling whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the Soviet Union. 
16/wsj_1687:On top of all this, corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the Midwest harvest was disrupted by a freakishly early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of Indiana and Ohio.
16/wsj_1687:A number of developments were negatively interpreted by traders.
16/wsj_1687:One price-depressing development was the lower-than-expected increase of only 0.2% in the consumer price index for September, an analyst said.
16/wsj_1687:Both are in great need of foreign exchange, and South Africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments, he said. "Putting it all together, we have a negative scenario that doesn't look like it will improve overnight," he said. 
16/wsj_1687:That contract fell a total of 5.75 cents during the first three days of this week, mostly in reaction to last Friday's stock market plunge, which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the U.S. economy and thus reduced demand for copper, a leading industrial metal.
16/wsj_1687:In recent days, however, there has been increased purchasing of copper in London, an analyst said.
16/wsj_1687:Some of this buying was by Japan, which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production stoppages at the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea, Highland Valley mine in British Columbia, and the Cananea mine in Mexico, which are major shippers to Japan.
16/wsj_1687:The increasing likelihood that Cananea and Highland Valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing, but even if any of these mines begin operating soon, their output won't be significant until at least the end of the year, analysts note.
16/wsj_1687:But a flurry of late trading yesterday beefed up prices.
16/wsj_1688:Melvin Belli's San Francisco law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after Tuesday's earthquake. 
16/wsj_1688:In the first 25 minutes after his office's telephone service was restored yesterday morning, 17 potential clients had called seeking the services of the self-proclaimed King of Torts. 
16/wsj_1688:The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an "act of God." 
16/wsj_1688:For now, says Laurence Drivon, president-elect of the 6,000-member California Trial Lawyers Association, "the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued, or whether they have liability or not.
16/wsj_1688:He adds that "they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the San Andreas Fault." 
16/wsj_1688:Defense lawyers, perhaps understandably, say that plaintiffs' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims, though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at individually. "A lot of this is going to be code-related," says Ignazio J. Ruvolo, a construction law specialist at Bronson, Bronson & McKinnon, a San Francisco law firm.
16/wsj_1688:Built into the statute are so-called design immunities, which are likely to protect government agencies, according to Mr. Ruvolo and Richard Covert, a lawyer with the California Department of Transportation, which oversees the damaged Bay Bridge.
16/wsj_1688:The state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards, says Mr. Covert.
16/wsj_1688:Nevertheless, he adds, "I wouldn't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the Bay Bridge." 
16/wsj_1688:Mr. Covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday, and Mr. Belli's courtyard was strewn with bricks.
16/wsj_1688:He said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town-house office and helped victims apply for federal aid -- free of charge. 
16/wsj_1688:The association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is unethical. 
16/wsj_1689:Apparently a lot, according to the British firm of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells. 
16/wsj_1689:The British firm has begun court proceedings in London to prevent the use of the name "Deloitte" by Deloitte, Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross & Co. in England and the rest of the world.
16/wsj_1689:The British Deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of Deloitte and Touche world-wide and joined Coopers & Lybrand. 
16/wsj_1689:John Bullock, senior partner of Deloitte in the U.K., said "the decision to start these proceedings hasn't been taken lightly." Mr. Bullock said the British firm has used the name "Deloitte" since 1845.
16/wsj_1689:In the U.S., Deloitte, Haskins & Sells was known as Haskins & Sells until 1978, when it added the "Deloitte" name of its British affiliate. 
16/wsj_1689:John C. Burton, an accounting professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business, said "there's a lot of emotion involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in England, where accounting predates the U.S." Although accountants aren't noted as "being deeply emotional, they really hold it all in," said Mr. Burton, former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
16/wsj_1689:J. Michael Cook, chairman of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells International, said he believes the legal action by the British firm "to be without merit." Mr. Cook said that last June, the international executive committes of Deloitte and Touche agreed to a world-wide merger. "The merger is proceeding according to plan, except as to the withdrawal of the Deloitte U.K. firm," he said. 
16/wsj_1689:In England, this would mean that the British Deloitte would lose revenue for its audit of GM's Vauxhill unit. 
16/wsj_1689:The defection of Deloitte's affiliates in Britain and the Netherlands to Coopers & Lybrand will make Coopers one of the biggest accounting firms in Europe, rivaling KPMG Peat Marwick there.
16/wsj_1689:In New York, Harris Amhowitz, general counsel of Coopers, said Coopers "was aware of the litigation," but he declined further comment.
16/wsj_1690:William Bennett, the White House drug-policy director, accused local officials in the Washington area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers. 
16/wsj_1690:But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for blocking the use of possible sites in that state.
16/wsj_1690:Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city. 
16/wsj_1690:In a letter to Mr. Bennett's office, released yesterday, Washington's city administrator, Carol Thompson, complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital.
16/wsj_1690:Of his successes in Washington, Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates.
16/wsj_1690:He also noted that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration has established a federal-local task force responsible since April for 106 arrests and more than $2 million in seizures of drug dealers' assets.
16/wsj_1690:The Defense Department has lent the Washington U.S. attorney 10 prosecutors, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has provided crime laboratory facilities and training, he added. 
16/wsj_1691:In the wake of the earthquake in California and the devastation of Hurricane Hugo, many companies in disaster-prone areas are pondering the question of preparedness.
16/wsj_1691:Some, particularly in West Coast earthquake zones, are dusting off their evacuation plans, checking food stocks and reminding employees of what to do if emergency strikes.
16/wsj_1691:Some big companies have teams of in-house experts focusing on safety and business resumption.
16/wsj_1691:Many companies in the path of potential disaster have set up contingency offices in safe regions, hoping they can transport employees there and resume operations quickly.
16/wsj_1691:That means making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm's way. 
16/wsj_1691:"Self-sufficiency has to be the cornerstone of your plan," says Stephanie Masaki-Schatz, manager of corporate emergency planning at Atlantic Richfield Co. in Los Angeles. "If you don't save your critical people, you won't be able to bring up your vital business functions." 
16/wsj_1691:Although ARCO's head office, more than 300 miles from the epicenter, wasn't affected by this week's tremors, Ms. Masaki-Schatz used the occasion to distribute a three-page memo of "Earthquake Tips" to 1,200 ARCO employees. 
16/wsj_1691:The ARCO memo urges employees to keep certain supplies at work, such as solid shoes and "heavy gloves to clear debris." It also recommends that employees be aware of everyday office items that could be used for emergency care or shelter.
16/wsj_1691:The ARCO plan takes into account such details as which aspects of business are busier at certain times of the year.
16/wsj_1691:Although officials of the savings and loan, a unit of Great Western Financial Corp., used some of their new plans and equipment during this week's quake, they still lost touch for more than 24 hours with 15 branches in the affected areas, not knowing if employees were injured or vaults were broken open. 
16/wsj_1691:The company also maintains rechargeable flashlights in offices and changes its standby supply of drinking water every three months. 
16/wsj_1691:Vista Chemical Co., with three chemical plants in and near Lake Charles, La., "prepares for every hurricane that enters the Gulf of Mexico," says Keith L. Fogg, a company safety director.
16/wsj_1691:The company doesn't wait until the final hours to get ready for hurricanes. "There are just tons of things that have to be considered," Mr. Fogg says. "Empty tank cars will float away on you if you get a big tidal surge." 
16/wsj_1692:In a ruling by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Mr. Gaubert received the go-ahead to pursue a claim against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas for losses he suffered when the Bank Board closed the Independent American Savings Association of Irving, Texas. 
16/wsj_1692:Mr. Gaubert, who was chairman and the majority stockholder of Independent American, had relinquished his control in exchange for federal regulators' agreement to drop their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan.
16/wsj_1692:As part of the agreement, Mr. Gaubert contributed real estate valued at $25 million to the assets of Independent American. 
16/wsj_1692:While under the control of federal regulators, Independent American's net worth dropped from $75 million to a negative $400 million, wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert's real estate contribution and his stock in the institution. 
16/wsj_1692:Mr. Gaubert's suit to recover his damages was dismissed last year by U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney of Dallas under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees. 
16/wsj_1692:Earlier this week, a Fifth Circuit appellate panel upheld Judge Maloney's dismissal of Mr. Gaubert's claim as a shareholder but said the judge should reconsider Mr. Gaubert's claim for the loss of his property. "It may depend on whether there was an express or implied promise . . . that the federal officials would not negligently cause the deterioration" of Independent American, the court wrote.
16/wsj_1692:Mr. Gaubert's lawyer, Abbe David Lowell of Washington, D.C., says the impact of the ruling on other cases involving thrift takeovers will depend on the degree of similarity in the facts. "I don't know if this will affect one institution or a hundred," Mr. Lowell says. "It does establish a very clear precedent for suing the FHLBB where there was none before." 
16/wsj_1692:In a suit filed in state court in Manhattan, the American Civil Liberties Union is representing the former maitre'd of the chic Odeon restaurant.
16/wsj_1692:The suit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $1 million, alleges that the firing of Marcia Trees Levine violated New York state's human-rights law.
16/wsj_1692:Among other things, the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy. 
16/wsj_1692:The suit alleges that Ms. Levine was fired after she refused to accept a lower paying, less visible job upon reaching her sixth month of pregnancy.
16/wsj_1692:LAWYERS IN Texas's biggest bank-fraud case want out in face of retrial. 
16/wsj_1692:Lawyers representing five of the seven defendants in the case say their clients can no longer afford their services.
16/wsj_1692:The trial of the case lasted seven months and ended in September with a hung jury. 
16/wsj_1692:The defendants were indicted two years ago on charges that they conspired to defraud five thrifts of more than $130 million through a complicated scheme to inflate the price of land and condominium construction along Interstate 30, east of Dallas. 
16/wsj_1692:The defense lawyers, three of whom are solo practitioners, say they can't afford to put their law practices on hold for another seven-month trial.
16/wsj_1692:Some of the lawyers say they would continue to represent their clients if the government pays their tab as court-appointed lawyers. 
16/wsj_1692:Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Hart of Dallas says the government will oppose any efforts to bring in a new defense team because it would delay a retrial. 
16/wsj_1692:FEDERAL JUDGE ALCEE HASTINGS of Florida, facing impeachment, received an unanticipated boost yesterday.
16/wsj_1692:Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) urged acquittal of the judge in a brief circulated to his Senate colleagues during closed-door deliberations.
16/wsj_1692:Sen. Specter was vice chairman of the impeachment trial committee that heard evidence in the Hastings case last summer.
16/wsj_1692:A former prosecutor and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Specter is expected to exercise influence when the Senate votes on the impeachment today. 
16/wsj_1692:RICHMOND RESIGNATIONS: Six partners in the Richmond, Va., firm of Browder, Russell, Morris & Butcher announced they are resigning.
16/wsj_1692:Five of the partners -- James W. Morris, Philip B. Morris, Robert M. White, Ann Adams Webster and Jacqueline G. Epps -- are opening a boutique in Richmond to concentrate on corporate defense litigation, particularly in product liability cases.
16/wsj_1693:The publisher was able to register soaring quarter net income because of a onetime gain on the sale of its cable-TV system.
16/wsj_1693:The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines, lower earnings from the forest-products group, and what is proving to be a nagging major problem, continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times, the company's flagship daily newspaper. 
16/wsj_1693:Analysts said the company's troubles mirror those of the industry.
16/wsj_1693:Retail advertising, which often represents half of the advertising volume at most daily newspapers, largely isn't rebounding in the second half from extended doldrums as expected.
16/wsj_1693:Dow Jones & Co. recently reported net fell 9.9%, a reflection, in part, of continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron's magazine. 
16/wsj_1693:John S. Reidy, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said, "The Times faces the same problem of other publishers: linage is down.
16/wsj_1693:Mr. Sulzberger said the scheduled opening of a new color-printing plant in Edison, N.J., in 1990 would involve heavy startup and depreciation costs. 
16/wsj_1693:The sale of the company's cable franchise brought an after-tax gain of $193.3 million, part of which will be used to reduce debt.
16/wsj_1693:Analysts said they were impressed by the performance of the company's newspaper group, which consists of the Times, 35 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in the International Herald Tribune; group operating profit for the quarter increased slightly to $34.9 million from $34.5 million on flat revenue. 
16/wsj_1694:Investors celebrated the second anniversary of Black Monday with a buying spree in both stocks and bonds.
16/wsj_1694:The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up about 60 points in mid-afternoon, finished with a gain of 39.55 points, to 2683.20.
16/wsj_1694:Many takeover-related stocks rose after news that a group obtained financing commitments for the proposed buy-out of American Medical International Inc.
16/wsj_1694:That news, plus recent signs of economic sluggishness, greatly increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease credit further, which in turn would be good news for stocks, investment managers say. "I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy, and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt," said Garnett L. Keith Jr., vice chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, one of the nation's largest institutional investors.
16/wsj_1694:But Wall Street analysts expect further signs of economic weakness in government reports during the next few weeks.
16/wsj_1694:If so, that will cinch the case for another shot of credit-easing within a month or so.
16/wsj_1694:"We're not out of the woods yet by any means," said George R. Mateyo, president and chief executive of Carnegie Capital Management Co., Cleveland.
16/wsj_1694:But many individual investors are leery about stocks because of fresh signs of fragility in the huge junk-bond market. 
16/wsj_1694:Investors also are anxious about today's "witching hour," the monthly expiration of stock-index futures and options, and options on individual stocks.
16/wsj_1694:This phenomenon often makes stock prices swing wildly at the end of the trading session. 
16/wsj_1695:Tuesday's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that hasn't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that, at least at the federal level, political "ticket splitting" has been on the rise over the past half century.
16/wsj_1695:In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives.
16/wsj_1695:In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress.
16/wsj_1695:What accounts for the results of recent decades?
16/wsj_1695:1) Voters can "buy" one of two brands when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action, and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest. 
16/wsj_1695:3) Republican congressional representatives, because of their belief in a minimalist state, are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are Democratic members of Congress. 
16/wsj_1695:If they put a Republican into office, not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from "bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies.
16/wsj_1695:Each legislator, after all, is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making. 
16/wsj_1695:First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century: Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe. 
16/wsj_1695:For example, first-term members of the House, once the most vulnerable of incumbents, have become virtually immune to defeat.
16/wsj_1695:The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982.
16/wsj_1695:Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent.
16/wsj_1695:To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to their disadvantage, the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates. 
16/wsj_1695:To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office. 
16/wsj_1695:Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts. 
16/wsj_1695:Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Republican colleagues.
16/wsj_1695:First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do.
16/wsj_1695:To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns. 
16/wsj_1695:This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House.
16/wsj_1695:Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices.
16/wsj_1695:An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 (when control of that body changed party hands), moreover, reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table cannot be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise, due to their majority-party status, over other resources such as committee staff. 
16/wsj_1695:An additional piece of evidence from the Senate: Holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional factors, the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government's tax burden is per state (a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder).
16/wsj_1695:A cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, reveals that, holding other factors constant, the difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate. 
16/wsj_1695:In sum, at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation. 
16/wsj_1695:Mr. Zupan teaches at the University of Southern California's business school. 
16/wsj_1696:The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then, but beginning in fiscal 1991, the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $500 million until the total liability of approximately $1.25 billion is paid.
16/wsj_1696:The action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments, but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparations first authorized in 1988. 
16/wsj_1696:The action came as Congress sent to President Bush a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated $156.7 billion for the Departments of Labor, Education, Health and Human Services.
16/wsj_1696:Final approval was on a 67-31 roll call in the Senate, which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. Bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women. 
16/wsj_1696:Reversing an eight-year federal policy, the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest, but Mr. Bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother's life is in danger.
16/wsj_1696:Mr. Bush's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House, but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill. 
16/wsj_1696:The measure before the conference yesterday funds the Departments of State, Justice and Commerce through fiscal 1990.
16/wsj_1696:An estimated $1.32 billion is provided for next year's census, and negotiators stripped a Senate-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens. 
16/wsj_1696:And in a footnote to the fall of House Speaker James Wright this year, the conference voted to rescind $11.8 million in unspent EDA funds for a Fort Worth, Texas, stockyards project that figured in ethics charges against the former Democratic leader. 
16/wsj_1696:Fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies, and an 18% increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission's budget would be financed entirely by an added $26 million in filing fees.
16/wsj_1696:In an unprecedented step, the measure anticipates another $30 million in receipts by having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases -- a change that is almost certain to increase Pentagon costs in processing personnel and security clearances. 
16/wsj_1696:Similarly, the measure adjusts the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $1.6 million each in drug grants, or three times the current minimum. 
16/wsj_1696:The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures, and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency.
16/wsj_1696:Lawmakers scrapped all of a $7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville, Spain, but agreed elsewhere to $15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger. 
16/wsj_1696:His Republican counterpart, Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the Legal Services Corp. 
16/wsj_1696:An estimated $321 million is provided to maintain the program, but Mr. Rudman also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed.
16/wsj_1696:The effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until Oct. 1 next year, and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the Food Research and Action Center. 
16/wsj_1697:Mercury Savings & Loan Association said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its lead investment banker to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the Huntington Beach, Calif., thrift. 
16/wsj_1697:Mercury, which has assets of more than $2 billion and 24 branches in California, said the action to improve its regulatory capital position is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation.
16/wsj_1697:Mercury also said it extended its two-year advisory relationship with Montgomery Securities of San Francisco. 
16/wsj_1698:Watching Congress sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors, fighting the urge to spend more, we're reminded of those late-night movies in which the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says, "Stop me before I kill again." The Members know they're doing wrong, but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions. 
16/wsj_1698:Arkansas Democrat David Pryor spilled his guts on the Senate floor the other day after he'd joined the Finance Committee's early-morning pork-barrel revels: "I must tell you . . . I come to the floor tonight as one who ended up with a busload of extraneous matter.
16/wsj_1698:"Frankly, as I was walking back to get in my car, I heard many, many people . . . opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for slipping this in," he said. "As I was driving home, I did not feel very good about myself." 
16/wsj_1698:We can applaud Mr. Pryor's moment of epiphany, even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again.
16/wsj_1698:Instead it's a form of "enhanced rescission," giving a President a chance to rescind, or strike, specific spending items that just go too far. 
16/wsj_1698:Under the proposal, a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of "rescissions" to the Hill -- once when he proposes his budget and again after Congress disposes.
16/wsj_1698:Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were both big users of the impoundment power, but Congress saw its chance against a weakened President Nixon and stripped it away. 
16/wsj_1698:In 1987, President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3% of the spending total was approved by Congress.
16/wsj_1698:The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies, but the police (in the form of a President) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy, as they do now. 
16/wsj_1698:Mr. Coats plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month.
16/wsj_1699:The Office of Management and Budget has begun looking into legislation to provide more funds for earthquake repairs.
16/wsj_1699:One of the last big employers in the Silicon Valley to report in, Seagate Technology, said it expects to be back at full strength Monday.
16/wsj_1699:The day before the quake, Seagate completed three days of emergency training and drills. 
16/wsj_1699:Echoing the response of almost all big corporations in the Bay Area, Don Waite, Seagate's chief financial officer, said, "I wouldn't expect this to have any significant financial impact." 
16/wsj_1699:Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90% of their usual capacity, but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled, leaving the previously full hotel with an 80% vacancy rate.
16/wsj_1699:City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings, but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled.
16/wsj_1699:Among the city's banks, Bank of America said all but eight of its 850 branches were open.
16/wsj_1699:Power failures kept just seven of its 1,500 automated-teller machines off-line.
16/wsj_1699:Securities-trading operations were moved to Bank of America's Concord office, and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to Los Angeles, the bank said. 
16/wsj_1699:Only five of 496 branches statewide remain closed, while 23 of 600 automated-teller machines remained out of order. 
16/wsj_1699:The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake's epicenter, 80 miles south of San Francisco.
16/wsj_1699:Santa Clara County has a running total so far of $504 million, excluding the hard-hit city of Los Gatos. 
16/wsj_1699:Oakland officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday; a section of I-880, a twotiered highway, collapsed in Oakland, causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake. 
16/wsj_1699:That includes dwellings in the ravaged Marina district that must be demolished, peeled business facades south of Market Street, and houses in the city's outer Richmond district that were heaved off their foundations.
16/wsj_1699:The federal funds would go to a range of programs, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, highway construction accounts and the Small Business Administration, according to Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.). 
16/wsj_1699:FEMA, which coordinates federal disaster relief, is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo, which hit the Carolinas last month.
16/wsj_1699:It is likely to get as much as $800 million initially in additional funds, and eventually could get more than $1 billion, according to Mr. Fazio, a member of the House Appropriations Committee. 
16/wsj_1699:He added that the Office of Management and Budget, the Transportation Department and other agencies are "developing longer-term legislation" that should be ready soon. 
16/wsj_1699:Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges.
16/wsj_1699:The city's main library is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls, and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the Beaux Arts City Hall broke off in the temblor. 
16/wsj_1699:The ground along the Embarcaderothe street that skirts the city's eastern boundary and piers -- dropped six inches after the quake, wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers.
16/wsj_1699:Offices of the city's Rent Board were destroyed. 
16/wsj_1699:Mayor Agnos's $2 billion estimate doesn't include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city, some of which remained closed.
16/wsj_1699:A major chunk of the $2 billion is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency, said a spokesman for Mr. Agnos. "All of the city's $5.9 million emergency reserve was spent in the first 24 hours" on overtime salaries, he said. 
16/wsj_1699:Insurers struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices. 
16/wsj_1699:"Claims range from a scratched fender -- and there were an awful lot of cars damaged in this -- to a major processing plant," a spokesman said. "We're delivering a check for $750,000 to an automotive business in Berkeley that burned on Tuesday." 
16/wsj_1699:Fireman's is part of a $38 million syndicate that supplies business interruption insurance to the city on the Bay Bridge, which must pay employees during the three weeks or more it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income. 
16/wsj_1699:California lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a $100 million cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster, as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads. 
16/wsj_1699:In addition, under the highway-relief program, the federal government provides 100% of emergency highway aid for only the first 90 days of a repair effort.
16/wsj_1699:For interstate highways, the federal share normally would drop to 90% of the cost of repairs, and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost.
16/wsj_1699:Meanwhile, the FEMA announced a toll-free telephone number (800-462-9029) to expedite service to victims of the earthquake.
16/wsj_1699:The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes to add numerous new bus routes and train departures to help alleviate the traffic problem.
16/wsj_1699:Moreover, state officials are urging freight haulers to bypass many of the area's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours.
16/wsj_1699:Even so, "We're looking for chaos," said George Gray, a deputy district director at the California Department of Transportation. "If there's any way you can do it, you ought to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while." 
16/wsj_1699:Most of San Francisco's tourists and business travelers already have left -- despite hotel's offers of rate cuts. "Everyone left," said Peter Lang, reservations manager of the Mark Hopkins Hotel. 
17/wsj_1700:Is an American Secretary of State seriously suggesting that the Khmer Rouge should help govern Cambodia?
17/wsj_1700:There are no easy choices in Cambodia, but we can't imagine that it benefits the U.S. to become the catalyst for an all-too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in Cambodia. 
17/wsj_1700:Now that Vietnam appears to have pulled out its occupation army, the State Department is talking again about accepting an "interim" coalition government in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh.
17/wsj_1700:The aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of Cambodia by allowing the Khmer Rouge a small share of power.
17/wsj_1700:Within two years, the moderates were exiled or in prison, Nicaragua had gone communist, and the Sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in Latin America and threatening their neighbors.
17/wsj_1700:Even Mao Tse-tung's China began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller, non-communist parties. 
17/wsj_1700:What complicates the scene in Cambodia is that the current regime is already communist, as are its Vietnamese overseers back in Hanoi, as are the Khmer Rouge -- who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups.
17/wsj_1700:It's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government, but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear.
17/wsj_1700:The Hun Sen regime has sent thousands of conscript laborers to die of malaria and malnourishment while building Cambodia's equivalent of the Berlin Wall near the Thai border.
17/wsj_1700:These utopians caused the deaths -- by starvation, disease or execution -- of well over one million Cambodians.
17/wsj_1700:The Cambodian horror was so bad that the Vietnamese occupation in 1978 was a perverse form of relief. 
17/wsj_1700:The world might want to believe that the Khmer Rouge can't still be such bad guys, just as in the late 1970s it was reluctant to credit the reports of genocide then taking place.
17/wsj_1700:Some of our sources in Thailand say the notorious old Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, has been holed up this summer in Khmer Rouge camps near the Thai-Cambodian border. 
17/wsj_1700:True, Prince Sihanouk backs the idea of such a coalition, at least for this week.
17/wsj_1700:But Prince Sihanouk has backed all sorts of ideas over the years, and done rather better by himself than by Cambodia.
17/wsj_1700:It would be entirely rational for communist insurgents in countries such as the Philippines or Peru to conclude the following: Fight viciously enough and the U.S., under the banner of pragmatism, might eventually help negotiate your way to victory.
17/wsj_1700:The administration and Congress have lately tangoed around the idea of sending military aid to Cambodia's non-communists.
17/wsj_1700:But now the possibility of "diplomatic movement" (Vietnam's withdrawal, the Baker initiative) has put that plan on hold, with the proviso that if the going got rough, the U.S. would then rearm the opposition.
17/wsj_1700:At the very least, the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the Khmer Rouge and Cambodia's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents.
17/wsj_1700:When that day comes, it would be particularly awful to know that the United States sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means to settle their fate with at least a little honor. 
17/wsj_1701:He takes additional responsibility for newspaper sales and distribution of the Financial Times in North America.
17/wsj_1702:Cipher Data Products Inc. posted a net loss of $14.2 million, or 97 cents a share, for its fiscal first quarter, compared with net income of $3.8 million, or 27 cents a share, a year ago. 
17/wsj_1702:Cipher Data, a San Diego maker of magnetic tape peripherals and optical disc drives, said the loss included reserves of $3.8 million related to a corporate restructuring. 
17/wsj_1702:It is eliminating the positions of president and chief operating officer, formerly held by Edward L. Marinaro. 
17/wsj_1703:FileNet Corp., Costa Mesa, Calif., said it expects to report a third-quarter loss of about $1.8 million, or 17 cents a share, because of a $2.5 million reserve to be taken against potential losses on a contract with the state of California.
17/wsj_1703:The maker of document image processing equipment said the state procurement division had declared FileNet in default on its contract with the secretary of state uniform commercial code division.
17/wsj_1703:FileNet said it doesn't believe the state has a valid basis of default and is reviewing its legal rights under the contract, but said it can't predict the outcome of the dispute. 
17/wsj_1703:The company made the announcement after the close of the markets, where its stock finished at $10.75, up 25 cents, in over-the-counter trading. 
17/wsj_1704:Clinton and Timken agreed not to disclose the value of the contract. 
17/wsj_1704:Timken, a producer of bearings and specialty steel, already buys gas from Clinton. 
17/wsj_1704:Clinton said in Columbus, Ohio, that its Clinton Gas Marketing unit wants to line up a number of such gas management contracts.
17/wsj_1704:Manufacturers frequently don't have anyone who is a specialist in natural gas, Clinton said, and a specialist such as Clinton can save them substantial amounts of money. 
17/wsj_1705:The scene opens with pinstripe-suited executives -- Easterners, obviously -- glued to cellular phones and hightailing it out of town in chauffeur-driven limousines. 
17/wsj_1705:As the music swells, viewers discover they're watching a commercial for Lone Star Beer, the pride of Texas, a product of G. Heileman Brewing Co., a La Crosse, Wis., unit of Bond Corp. 
17/wsj_1705:As the ad's tone implies, the Texas spirit is pretty xenophobic these days, and Lone Star isn't alone in trying to take advantage of that.
17/wsj_1705:From Chevy trucks to Lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks, the state has been inundated with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating Texans and castigating outsiders. 
17/wsj_1705:That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who like to brag that Texas is the only state that was once a nation, but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders.
17/wsj_1705:In the past, writes Houston Chronicle columnist Jim Barlow, outlanders were accepted only after passing a series of tests to prove they had the "right" Texas attitudes and "of course they had to be dipped for parasites." 
17/wsj_1705:There is no small irony in the fact that some of the most-jingoistic advertising comes courtesy of -- you guessed it -- outsiders.
17/wsj_1705:All kinds of landmark Texas real estate has been snapped up by out-of-staters.
17/wsj_1705:"Texas has lost its distinctiveness, leaving Texans with a hunger to feel proud about themselves," says Stephen Klineberg, a sociology professor at Rice University, Houston. "This plays right into the hands of the advertising agencies." 
17/wsj_1705:For example, the iced-tea radio campaign for Thomas J. Lipton Co., an Englewood Cliffs, N.J., unit of Anglo-Dutch Unilever Group, emphatically proclaims: "Real Texans do not wear dock-siders -- ever.
17/wsj_1705:In developing that theme at Interpublic Group of Cos. ' Lintas: New York unit, account supervisor Lisa Buksbaum says she made a "couple of phone calls" to Dallas ad friends and reported her "findings" to a team of writers.
17/wsj_1705:Stan Richards of Richards Group Inc., Dallas, tells of the Texan who saw the agency's tear-jerking commercial for First Gibraltar Bank F.S.B. -- complete with the state's anthem -- and promptly invested $100,000 in the thrift's CDs.
17/wsj_1705:Never mind that First Gibraltar is one of the failed Texas thrifts taken over by outsiders -- in this case, an investor group headed by New York financier Ronald Perelman. 
17/wsj_1705:The North Texas Chevy Dealers recently had a record sales month after the debut of ad campaign that thumbs its nose at elite Easterners.
17/wsj_1705:And deposits at NCNB Texas National Bank, a unit of NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C., have increased $2 billion since last year after heavy advertising stressing commitment to Texas. "Obviously, pride sells in Texas," says a spokeswoman for Bozell Inc., Omaha, Neb., which represents 
17/wsj_1705:The ad campaigns usually follow one of three tracks -- stressing the company's `Texasness, ' pointing out the competition's lack thereof, or trying to be more Texan than Texans.
17/wsj_1705:Ford trucks may outsell Chevy trucks in places like "Connecticut and Long Island," sniffs a commercial for Chevrolet, a division of General Motors Corp.
17/wsj_1705:The commercial, created by Bateman, Bryan & Galles Inc., of Dallas, adds derisively: "I bet it takes a real tough truck to haul your Ivy League buddies to the yacht club." Because they want a truck that is "Texas tough," the commercial concludes, "Texans drive Chevy." 
17/wsj_1705:J.C. Penney Co., which relocated from New York to suburban Dallas two years ago, gently wraps itself in Texas pride through a full-page magazine ad: "Taking the long-range view to conserve what is of value to future generations is part of the Lone Star lifestyle," the ad reads. "It's part of our style, too." 
17/wsj_1705:The most-strident anti-outsider sentiment among bankers comes from the Independent Bankers Association of Texas, although it's hard to tell from previews of the $5 million "The I's of Texas" TV campaign.
17/wsj_1705:Commercials will highlight heart-rending scenes of Texas and chest-swelling, ain't-it-great-to-be-a-Texan music.
17/wsj_1705:Supporting banks will sign a "Texas Declaration of Independents." 
17/wsj_1705:But in introductory material for the campaign, the trade group urges members to "arm" for a "revolution" against big, out-of-state bank-holding companies.
17/wsj_1705:A video sent to association members, featuring shots of the Alamo, cowboys, fajitas and a statue of Sam Houston, doesn't mince words. "Texans can sniff a phony a mile away," the narrator warns outsiders. "So, don't come and try to con us with a howdy y'all or a cowboy hat." 
17/wsj_1705:COKE ADS: Coca-Cola Co. said it produced a new version of its 1971 "I'd like to teach the world to sing" commercial.
17/wsj_1705:The ad is part of Classic Coke's 1990 ad campaign, with the tag line, "Can't beat the Real Thing." Basketball star Michael Jordan and singer Randy Travis have also agreed to appear in ads. 
17/wsj_1706:Although the personal computer maker said it expects revenue to meet or exceed previous projections of $385 million for the year ending Jan. 28, 1990, earnings are expected to be 25 cents to 35 cents a share, down from previous estimates of 50 cents to 60 cents.
17/wsj_1706:Earnings for fiscal 1989 were $14.4 million, or 80 cents a share, on sales of $257.8 million. 
17/wsj_1706:Results for the third quarter ending Oct. 31, are expected to be released the third week of November, according to Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive officer.
17/wsj_1706:In the third quarter last year, Dell had net income of $5 million, or 26 cents a share, on sales of $75.2 million. 
17/wsj_1706:Some delays have been caused by a shortage of micoprocessors -- notably Intel Corp. 's newest chip, the 486 -- but others apparently have been caused by Dell's explosive growth and thinly stretched resources. 
17/wsj_1706:"They've got a lot of different balls in the air at the same time," observes Jim Poyner, a computer securities analyst with Dallas-based William K. Woodruff & Co. Mr. Dell, meanwhile, concedes the company was "definitely too optimistic" in its expectations. 
17/wsj_1706:Product delays, however, have left Dell buffeted by harsher competition in its bread-and-butter line of desktop computers, as powerhouse competitors Compaq Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. price their PCs more aggressively.
17/wsj_1706:Analyst James Weil of the Soundview Financial Group believes Dell's response has been to place increased emphasis on product quality, "in an effort to rise above some of that price pressure." But that has been the key to Compaq's success, he adds, whereas Dell carved out its market niche as a direct seller of low-cost but reliable computers -- and it might be too late in the game for a shift in strategy. 
17/wsj_1707:TransAtlantic Holdings PLC, a British-based, South African-controlled financial services investment group, and France's Societe Centrale Union des Assurances de Paris reached an accord effectively reducing chances of an unfriendly takeover for Sun Life Assurance Society PLC. 
17/wsj_1707:In a joint statement, the two companies, whose combined holdings equal 52.7% of Sun Life's ordinary shares, said their agreement is aimed at reducing "the uncertainty and instability for Sun Life that has resulted from two major shareholders owning" a controlling interest in the company. 
17/wsj_1707:TransAtlantic, whose Transol Investments Ltd. unit owns the largest minority stake in Sun Life, has agreed not to make a takeover bid for the British life insurer without the prior consent of the French company, known as UAP.
17/wsj_1708:Pride Petroleum Services Inc. said it agreed to buy well-servicing assets of two companies and expects to report higher third-quarter revenue and earnings. 
17/wsj_1708:In the year-earlier quarter, the well-servicing contractor had net income of $319,000, or 3 cents a share, on revenue of about $15 million.
17/wsj_1708:Separately, the Houston concern said it signed letters of intent for the cash and stock purchases of a total of 29 well-servicing rigs from two concerns located in New Mexico and California.
17/wsj_1709:Per-share earnings advanced 14% because of the buy-back. 
17/wsj_1709:This year's nine-month results include gains of $13 million, or five cents a share, from the sale of Schlumberger's defense systems business, and $22 million, or nine cents a share, from an award by the IranU.S.
17/wsj_1709:The year-earlier nine months include a gain of $35 million, or 13 cents a share, from sale of the company's Electricity Control & Transformers division. 
17/wsj_1710:The debentures, due in 2014, have a coupon of 7 3/4%, payable semiannually.
17/wsj_1710:The debentures may be converted into common stock of the Westborough, Mass., home health care concern at $52.50 a share.
17/wsj_1710:Proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including expansion of the company's operations. 
17/wsj_1711:The French building group Dumez S.A. said profit jumped 70% in the first half of 1989, partly on the strength of nonrecurring gains from a share issue by its Canadian unit. 
17/wsj_1711:The group noted that 75 million francs of the advance reflected a one-time gain from the June offering by its United Westburne unit in Canada.
17/wsj_1711:For all of 1988, Dumez had group profit of 452 million francs after payment to minority interests.
17/wsj_1711:The group hasn't forecast full-year earnings for 1989, although it said that its first-half results aren't a good indication because of one-time elements and the seasonal nature of its operations. 
17/wsj_1712:Few specialists said they expect the quake to have much of an effect on most California property values.
17/wsj_1712:This isn't going to help," said Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley.
17/wsj_1712:State housing prices, at a median $201,028, have declined in recent months because of potential buyers' inability to afford homes. 
17/wsj_1712:One San Francisco neighborhood likely to test Mr. Rosen's theory soon is the city's fashionable Marina district, which boasts some of the highest home prices in the state.
17/wsj_1712:Yesterday, the city demolished two dwellings in the district because of severe structural damage and said as many as 19 of the district's 350 dwellings might have to be razed. 
17/wsj_1712:Because of the size of the California market, few relocation specialists expect a widespread corporate flight in the quake's aftermath.
17/wsj_1712:But they said the quake will force some companies to relocate or expand part or all of their operations outside the state. 
17/wsj_1712:"What you're going to get is 'We don't want to put all of our eggs in one basket' theory," said James H. Renzas, president of Location Management Services Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif., relocation concern. 
17/wsj_1712:Because of the quake threat, "some firms have evaluated what the cost is to shore up their buildings and compared it with the cost of building it elswehere," he said. 
17/wsj_1712:One Southern California aerospace firm, for example, two months ago asked Location Management to compare the costs of reinforcing its current building against earthquakes with the cost of building a new structure elsewhere.
17/wsj_1713:Net income included a gain of $708,000 on asset sales, the real estate investment trust said.
17/wsj_1714:Aussedat Rey is a leading French maker of copying and electronic printing paper.
17/wsj_1714:Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed. 
17/wsj_1714:Aussedat Rey's move follows similar technology-licensing agreements between Japanese producers of thermal paper and European paper groups. 
17/wsj_1715:W.R. Grace & Co., New York, said its earnings for the third quarter nearly doubled as a result of a $114.4 million pre-tax gain from restructuring its energy operations and other adjustments. 
17/wsj_1715:The gain resulted from the sale of Grace Equipment Co., the initial public offering of a one-sixth interest in Grace Energy Corp. and an adjustment in the carrying value of certain natural resource assets not part of Grace Energy. 
17/wsj_1716:Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. said the third-quarter combined profit of its six gold mines dropped 8.5% from the previous quarter.

17/wsj_1718:The Canadian government introduced in the House of Commons legislation to extend federal regulatory authority over provincial government-owned telephone utilities in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
17/wsj_1718:The governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have strongly opposed federal regulation of their telephone companies.
17/wsj_1718:The extension of federal regulatory authority over telephone utilities in the Atlantic provinces hasn't required special legislation because they are investor-owned. 
17/wsj_1719:Under terms of the loan agreement, Amdura said it will omit the next quarterly dividends on its Series A, B, C and D preferred shares, which are due Nov. 15.
17/wsj_1719:Amdura's bridge loan, part of the financing for Amdura's acquisition of CoastAmerica in December 1988, was to come due next Friday.
17/wsj_1719:The company's new management, which took control of Amdura's board after a consent solicitation last month, wanted to extend the loan while it tries to sell two units.
17/wsj_1720:The deposits, assets and certain liabilities of the three thrifts were transferred to newly chartered federal mutual institutions. 
17/wsj_1720:The three institutions are: Mid Kansas Federal Savings & Loan Association, Wichita, which had $830.5 million in assets; Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association of McAllen, McAllen, Texas, with $582.6 million in assets; and Surety Savings Association, El Paso, with $309.3 million in assets.

17/wsj_1721:The announcement came as Societe Commerciale, a trading company with activities in more than 40 countries, reported a loss of 320.5 million francs ($51 million) for the first six months of this year, partly because of provisions on future losses. 
17/wsj_1721:The rescue operation will consist of a capital boost for Societe Commerciale of one billion francs through issues of new shares and convertible bonds. 
17/wsj_1721:This will give Paribas and Lonrho joint control of Societe Commerciale.

17/wsj_1723:Having survived both last Friday's 6.9% Wall Street plunge and the immediate aftermath of the San Francisco Bay area earthquake, Tokyo market participants expressed relief that trading had returned to normal. 
17/wsj_1723:Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of the stock trading division at Nikko Securities, said that after looking at the reasons for Friday's Wall Street plunge, participants realized that the Tokyo and New York markets have different economic fundamentals.
17/wsj_1723:This conclusion, he said, restored the credibility of Tokyo stocks. 
17/wsj_1723:Yoshiaki Mitsuoka, head of the investment information department at Daiwa Investment Trust & Management, said that if New York stocks just fluctuate in or near their current range, the Tokyo market will remain firm with a moderately upward trend for the rest of the year. 
17/wsj_1723:But traders said the market lacks a base on which to set long-term buying strategy, as the future direction of U.S. interest rates remains unclear. 
17/wsj_1723:"Investor interest switches back and forth ceaselessly as they are unable to shift their weight to one side for sure," Mr. Mitsuoka of Daiwa Investment Trust said. 
17/wsj_1723:Many of Wednesday's winners were losers yesterday as investors quickly took profits and rotated their buying to other issues, traders said. 
17/wsj_1723:Volume continued to ease from the active dealings at the start of the week.

"We regret very much that the mayor of San Francisco has decided not to cooperate with us on this matter in making sure that there is adequate federal support for the disaster in his city," Mr. Fitzwater said. 
17/wsj_1724:The White House announced that Mr. Agnos, along with the mayors of Oakland and Alameda, are to accompany President Bush on a tour of the earthquake area today.
17/wsj_1725:The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, also asks that the Comex's nine-month suspension of Mr. Semel be lifted, pending the broker's appeal of the disciplinary measures.
17/wsj_1725:The fine and suspension, announced in August, are the stiffest sanctions the Comex has ever ordered against one of its members. 
17/wsj_1725:The Comex accused the 39-year-old Mr. Semel of "fraudulent conduct" and improper trading.
17/wsj_1725:The lawsuit states that unless the sanctions are halted pending an appeal, the broker and his firm "will be irreparably injured and their business will be totally and permanently destroyed." Already the firm has paid $211,666 of the fine, the suit said, and it will have to liquidate additional assets in order to pay the rest. 
17/wsj_1726:Fannie Mae, a federally chartered and shareholder-owned company, said the lenders include Prudential Home Mortgage Co., a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America that operates in every state.

17/wsj_1731:The U.S. unit dipped to a session low against the mark just after the release of the U.S. consumer price index.
17/wsj_1731:But foreign-exchange dealers said the dollar staged a quick comeback, prompted by a round of short covering and some fresh buying interest later in the trading day. 
17/wsj_1731:Traders said that a nearly 40-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fueled in part by news of a lower-than-expected price index, had little influence on the dollar's moves. 
17/wsj_1731:In Tokyo Friday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.93 yen, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 141.55 yen. 
17/wsj_1731:They noted that because the consumer price index, known as the CPI, is a more comprehensive measure of inflation and is rising less rapidly than the producer-price index, or PPI, it could signal further easing by Fed. 
17/wsj_1731:A four-day matched sale-purchase agreement, a move to drain liquidity from the system, was viewed as a technical move, rather than an indication of tightening credit. 
17/wsj_1731:"There's a bottomless pit of dollar demand" by Japanese investors, said Graham Beale, managing director of foreign exchange at Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. in New York, adding that purely speculative demand wouldn't hold the dollar at its recent levels against the Japanese currency. 
17/wsj_1731:Robert White, manager of corporate trading at First Interstate of California, called the market "psychologically pro-mark," noting that the U.S. remains a "veritable grab bag" for Japanese investors which accounts for the unabated demand for U.S. dollars.

17/wsj_1732:Value of the properties and management interests wasn't disclosed. 
17/wsj_1732:In all, the Los Angeles-based trust plans to sell its interests in 36 hotels, while the corporation will sell its management interests in 32 of those properties. 
17/wsj_1732:Excluded from the sale are the interests of the trust and the corporation in two Las Vegas hotel-casinos. 
17/wsj_1732:After completing the sale and paying debts, the trust and corporation will consider a number of options including a stock repurchase, payment of special dividend or investment in more gaming properties.
17/wsj_1732:The companies will retain their current regular quarterly dividend of 25 cents during the sale process, Mr. Rothman said. 
17/wsj_1732:For the first six months, the trust and corporation had a net loss of $244,000. 
17/wsj_1733:Baxter International Inc., citing cost-cutting moves and increased sales of its home-care products and dialysis treatments, posted a 20% rise in third-quarter net income on a 5.9% sales boost.

17/wsj_1734:A group bidding for American Medical International Inc., New York, said it formally received the final financing needed for a $3 billion bid for about 86% of the hospital operator's stock. 
17/wsj_1734:Earlier this month, IMA said it had received about $1 billion of senior debt financing from Chemical Bank and six other banks; Chemical Bank said it was "highly confident" it could arrange the balance of about $509 million. 
17/wsj_1734:In addition, the $3 billion bid includes $1 billion of debt that will be assumed by IMA, $600 million of high-yield junk bonds that will be sold by First Boston Corp. and $285 million of equity. 
17/wsj_1734:American Medical has agreed to the offer, but earlier this month said it had received new "expressions of interest" from two previous bidders.
17/wsj_1735:H&R Block is one of the great success stories of U.S. business.
17/wsj_1735:Block's tax-preparation business is mature, they say, and some of its diversifications are facing tough competition. 
17/wsj_1735:The Street knows all about the predictability of its earnings, which are headed for a ninth consecutive yearly increase.
17/wsj_1735:But the tax-preparation business simply has no more room to grow, says Mark Cremonie, director of research for Capital Supervisors Inc., a Chicago firm that manages $6.5 billion. "You go to any medium-sized town in the U.S. and you're going to see H&R Block tax services." 
17/wsj_1735:Mr. Cremonie's firm once held about 4.8% of H&R Block.
17/wsj_1735:That was before the 1986 tax "reform" made taxes more complex than ever. "One thing you can bet on," he says, "is that Congress will do stupid things with the Tax Code." But Capital Supervisors sold the last of its H&R Block holdings earlier this year. "They're thrashing around for diversification," he says. "I think a lot of their businesses are just so-so." 
17/wsj_1735:Last week the stock hit an all-time high of 37 1/4 before getting roughed up in the Friday-the-13th minicrash.
17/wsj_1735:To be sure, the stock still has a lot of fans. "If you invested $10,000 in the initial public offering in 1962, it would be worth well over $5 million today," says Fredric E. Russell, a Tulsa, Okla., money manager. "I don't know what the risk is {of holding the stock}.
17/wsj_1735:Taxes are not going out of business." 
17/wsj_1735:Many of his peers feel the same way.
17/wsj_1735:The number of big institutions that own H&R Block shares is 207 and growing, according to a midyear tally by CDA Investment Technologies.
17/wsj_1735:Eugene Sit, president of Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis, says, "When we bought it, we thought the growth rate was going to accelerate" because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds (the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer, which waits for Uncle Sam's check). 
17/wsj_1735:But neither of those developments did much to juice up growth, Mr. Sit says.
17/wsj_1735:Two other money managers, in explaining why they have sold large amounts of H&R Block stock this year, spoke on the condition they not be named. 
17/wsj_1735:CompuServe provides about 20% of both sales and earnings.
17/wsj_1735:The tax business still provides about 70% of earnings, on about 50% of sales.
17/wsj_1735:Personnel Pool (temporary workers, mostly in the health-care area) chips in close to 25% of sales but only about 9% of earnings. 
17/wsj_1735:The shortage of nurses is crimping profit at Personnel Pool, said the second money manager.
17/wsj_1735:For example, he says, the company is planning to go nationwide with a new service, tested in parts of the country, aimed at taxpayers who want refunds in a hurry. 
17/wsj_1735:Mr. Bloch concedes that a recent diversification attempt fell through. "We're still interested {in diversifying}," he says, "but we'd rather be prudent than make a mistake." He also says CompuServe's earnings continue to grow "20% to 30% a year" in spite of tough competition from giants like Sears and IBM.
17/wsj_1735:Per-share earnings: Loss of 8 cents vs. loss of 9 cents 
17/wsj_1736:Philips Industries Inc. said its board authorized the redemption Dec. 6 of the company's $1 cumulative convertible special preferred stock at $37.50 a share, not including a 25 cent dividend for the current quarter, and the $3 cumulative convertible preferred stock at $75, plus a 75 cent dividend for the current quarter. 
17/wsj_1736:The Dayton, Ohio, maker of parts for the building and transportation industries said holders of the two issues can convert their stock into common shares through the close of business Dec. 1.
17/wsj_1736:Philips didn't indicate how many shares outstanding it has of either issue.

17/wsj_1737:Options lost some of their mystery in 1973 when the Chicago Board of Trade set up a special exchange to deal in them.
17/wsj_1737:The Chicago Board of Trade, the No. 1 U. S. grain market, had long chafed under the attention won by its innovative archrival, the livestock-dealing Mercantile Exchange.
17/wsj_1737:So the men who ran the grain pits listened when Joseph Sullivan, a 35-year-old former Wall Street Journal newsman, offered them the idea of all-options trading.
17/wsj_1737:After four year of tinkering and $2.4 million in seed money, the board set up the new marketplace, titled it the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and named Sullivan its first president. 
17/wsj_1737:The CBOE opened for business on April 26, 1973, in what had been a Board of Trade lunchroom.
17/wsj_1737:It listed just 16 options to buy a "pilot list" of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. (Puts, or sell options, would not be added until 1977.) The 282 members had paid $10,000 apiece for seats. (The 1989 price: $250,000.) 
17/wsj_1737:The first day's business was 911 contracts (each for 100 shares of one of the listed stocks).
17/wsj_1737:By the end of 1973, the number of "underlying" Big Board stocks had been increased to 50 and the options exchange had run up volume of 1.1 million contracts.
17/wsj_1737:Last year, more than 1,800 traders on the CBOE bought and sold 112 million contracts on 178 listed stocks, 60% of all U.S. listed options trading. 
17/wsj_1738:Seabrook officials said the plant could receive a full-power license by the end of the year. 
17/wsj_1738:The NRC rejected Mr. Shannon's argument that Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, which owns the largest share of Seabrook, and 11 other owners are financially unable to guarantee the plant's safe operation.
17/wsj_1738:Mr. Shannon was seeking a waiver of NRC policy that ignores financial considerations in making licensing decisions. 
17/wsj_1738:In its ruling, the NRC said that because Seabrook will be allowed to charge rates sufficient to run the plant and make payments on past construction costs, consideration of the owners' financial condition is pointless. 
17/wsj_1738:"The commissioners found the circumstances of the case didn't undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available funds adequate for safe operation," said a commission spokesman. 
17/wsj_1738:In January 1988, the utility filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, allowing it to continue to operate while protected from creditors' lawsuits. 
17/wsj_1739:For the fourth quarter, Bristol-Myers Squibb will report one set of earnings. 
17/wsj_1740:The drop in earnings didn't surprise analysts who said the Pittsburgh glass, coatings and chemical concern had been predicting a slow quarter because of the sluggish construction industry, a major market for the company's flat glass. 
17/wsj_1740:Glass sales to Canadian and European auto makers and sales of replacement auto glass in all markets increased.
17/wsj_1740:Also, chemicals sales were slightly down because of lower prices for vinyl chloride monomer and other chlorine derivatives. 
17/wsj_1741:Jefferies, a Los Angeles holding company primarily engaged in securities trading, also said stock market declines since the quarter ended Sept. 30 created an unrealized pretax loss of about $6 million in its risk arbitrage account. 
17/wsj_1742:Sony has agreed to buy both companies, but is in a legal battle with Warner Communications Inc. over the services of producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters. 
17/wsj_1742:Sony added that a hearing has been set for Thursday in the Delaware Chancery Court in one of the suits.

17/wsj_1743:China said the question of Taiwan's membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be considered only after China's own membership in the 97-nation organization is restored. 
17/wsj_1743:Both China and Taiwan are seeking seats in GATT, which sponsors trade-liberalizing agreements and sets world-commerce rules. "As one of China's provinces, Taiwan has no right to join GATT on its own," Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said. 
17/wsj_1743:China, under the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, was a founding member of GATT in 1947.
17/wsj_1743:The Nationalists withdrew in 1950, after their flight to Taiwan, and the Communist government in Beijing applied for restoration of China's membership in July 1986. 
17/wsj_1743:The base price of the car is estimated at 30 million yen (about $213,000).
17/wsj_1743:Along with the car, Wacoal plans to launch a series of Caspita-brand men's underwear. "Our image is a company that makes women's products," said a Wacoal spokesman. "Now, we're going to sell to men." 
17/wsj_1743:The British satirical magazine Private Eye won an appeal against the size of a $960,000 libel award to Sonia Sutcliffe, the estranged wife of the "Yorkshire Ripper" mass murderer.
17/wsj_1743:An appeals-court panel slashed all but $40,000 from the award, the largest ever set by a British jury, pending a reassessment of the damages.
17/wsj_1743:But the panel dismissed the magazine's contention that it hadn't libeled Mrs. Sutcliffe when it accused her of trying to sell her story to capitalize on the notoriety of her husband.

17/wsj_1743:News of the halt comes amid growing anger in the Ukraine and Byelorussia over continuing high levels of radiation from Chernobyl. 
17/wsj_1743:A former vice president of the Singapore branch of Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. was charged in court yesterday on 19 counts of cheating.
17/wsj_1743:Francis Dang, 41, is alleged to have been involved in cheating Drexel Burnham Lambert of up to 2.1 million Singapore dollars (US$1.1 million) by carrying out unauthorized transactions on the London Commodities Exchange and the International Petroleum Exchange.

17/wsj_1743:Just in time for Halloween, Britain's Oxford University Press is publishing a "Dictionary of Superstitions." The books 1,500 entries include stepping on cracks and knocking on wood. . . . In New Zealand's tiny township of Kaitaia, which has had direct dialing for less than a year, about 30 angry phone-company customers questioned the size of their bills.
17/wsj_1744:Slowing sales of its profitable Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles are forcing Chrysler Corp. to temporarily idle its Toledo, Ohio, assembly plant for the first time since April 1986. 
17/wsj_1744:That's a significant change from earlier this year when the plant worked substantial overtime only to have sales fall short of the company's bullish expectations. 
17/wsj_1744:Sales of Cherokee, the best-selling Jeep, and the lower-volume Wagoneer were actually up about 10% through the end of last month.
17/wsj_1744:The result: Chrysler dealers had a bloated 82-day supply of the Cherokee as of the end of last month and a 161-day supply of the Comanche pickup, which Toledo also builds.
17/wsj_1744:At Jasper Jeep-Eagle, one of the largest Jeep dealerships in the country, inventories have continued to swell.
17/wsj_1744:Steve Lowe, general manager of Jasper, Ga., dealership, said new rebates of $500 to $1,000 on the models have stimulated sales, but not enough to significantly cut dealer stocks. "If people aren't buying, you have to close plants," he said. 
17/wsj_1744:Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM to offer $800 rebates on those cars.
17/wsj_1744:The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet, but sales of the cars are off 9.6% for the year, and fell a steep 34.2% early this month. 
17/wsj_1744:Ford Motor Co. said it will shut down for one week its Kentucky Truck Plant because of a "shortage of dealer orders." The shutdown will idle 2,000 hourly employees and eliminate production of about 1,300 medium and heavy duty trucks.
17/wsj_1745:(See: "Technology: Lotus Development Posts Surge of 51% in 3rd-Quarter Profit" -- WSJ Oct. 19, 1989) 
17/wsj_1746:First Fidelity Bancorp., Lawrenceville, N.J., reported a 24% drop in third-quarter profit, because of a decline in earning assets, lower loan volume and tighter interest margins. 
17/wsj_1746:The bank holding company posted net income of $54.4 million, or 87 cents a share, including $1.7 million, or three cents a share, in one-time tax benefits.
17/wsj_1746:The rise resulted from the transfer to non-accrual status of $96 million "owed by two national borrowers and one local commercial real-estate customer," First Fidelity said.
17/wsj_1746:It said it doesn't anticipate any loss of principal on two of the loans, comprising $85 million of these credits. 
17/wsj_1746:First Fidelity said it boosted its loan-loss provision to $50.9 million from $20.4 million a year ago, primarily because of a weaker real-estate sector in the region. 
17/wsj_1748:The company said it was leasing the site of the refinery from Aruba.
17/wsj_1748:Exxon Corp. built the plant but closed it in 1985 and sold off much of the equipment to dismantling contractors, from whom Coastal bought back much of the equipment. 
17/wsj_1748:The prime minister of Aruba has said it could cost around $100 million. 
17/wsj_1748:Coastal said the refinery's expected daily production will include 34,000 barrels of jet fuel, 32,000 barrels of low-sulfur diesel fuel, 30,000 barrels of naphtha, 17,000 barrels of residual fuel oil, 8,000 barrels of asphalt and 25,000 barrels of low-sulfur catalytic cracker feedstock. 
17/wsj_1749:Loral Corp. said fiscal second-quarter net income was $19.8 million, or 79 cents a share, compared with year-earlier earnings from continuing operations of $15.6 million, or 62 cents a share. 
17/wsj_1749:Year-earlier net of $21 million, or 84 cents a share, included the results of Loral's former Aircraft Braking Systems and Engineered Fabrics divisions, which were sold April 27 to the company's chairman, Bernard L. Schwartz. 
17/wsj_1749:The increase was due mainly to a $325 million order from Turkey to equip its fleet of F-16 fighters with Loral's ALQ-178 Rapport III electronic countermeasures system.
17/wsj_1749:Mr. Schwartz said the recent increase in orders "puts us well on the way to our goal of $1.6 billion in bookings for the year." He added: "I expect to see the earnings momentum we experienced this quarter continue for the rest of the year." 
17/wsj_1749:Loral said it expects sales to accelerate in both the third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year. 
17/wsj_1749:Loral's profit from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal 1990 was $36.4 million, or $1.44 a share, up 31% from $27.8 million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier.
17/wsj_1750:HealthVest said two of its lenders have given it notices of default on bank loans and said they may take actions to recover their loans. 
17/wsj_1750:In addition, HealthVest said Bank of Tokyo Trust Co. also has notified it of a default and said it might take action to cure the default.
17/wsj_1750:HealthVest missed an interest payment to Bank of Tokyo on Oct. 1.
17/wsj_1750:Healthcare operates many of the health-care properties that HealthVest owns. 
17/wsj_1752:Storage Technology Corp. had net income of $8.3 million, or 32 cents a share, for its fiscal-third quarter ended Sept. 29, almost 15 times the $557,000, or two cents a share, it posted for the year-ago period. 
17/wsj_1752:Storage, Louisville, Colo., which makes data-storage devices for mainframe computers, said the huge increase in net reflects "strong sales" of its tape products, particularly the 4400 Automated Cartridge System, which holds a library of tape cartridges.
17/wsj_1752:For the nine months, Storage had net of $25.5 million, or 98 cents a share, including an $11.3 million extraordinary gain for the anticipated proceeds from liquidating an Irish unit.
17/wsj_1753:A Canadian government agency conditionally approved proposed exports to the U.S. of natural gas from big, untapped fields in the Mackenzie River delta area of the western Canadian Arctic. 
17/wsj_1753:Three companies, Esso Resources Canada Ltd., Shell Canada Ltd. and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., applied to the Canadian National Energy Board to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta natural gas over 20 years starting in 1996. 
17/wsj_1753:To be economically feasible, the 11 billion Canadian dollar (US$9.37 billion) project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices.
17/wsj_1753:The project could result in the U.S. taking more than 10% of its natural gas supplies from Canada, up from about 5% currently.
17/wsj_1753:It would bring 13 gas fields into production at a combined rate of about 1.2 billion cubic feet a day. 
17/wsj_1753:The board estimated that the cost of building a pipeline from the Mackenzie delta to Alberta would be about C$5.9 million.
17/wsj_1753:It also said projections of surging U.S. demand for natural gas and price forecasts of C$5.25 per thousand cubic feet by 2005 would make the project economically viable. 
17/wsj_1753:Esso, a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd. which is 71%-owned by Exxon Corp., will be allowed to export 5.1 trillion cubic feet to the U.S. in the 20-year period.
17/wsj_1753:Shell, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, will be allowed to export 0.9 trillion cubic feet, and Gulf, a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. will be allowed to export 3.2 trillion cubic feet. 
17/wsj_1754:The company agreed to sell its minority investments in makers of steam-generating and related equipment, Stein Industrie and Energie & Verfahrenstechnik, to the major shareholder in the companies, Dutch-based GEC Alsthom N.V. 
17/wsj_1754:That unit of its Georgia Kaolin Co. subsidiary was sold to a unit of Unimin Corp. 
17/wsj_1754:Assets of Construction Equipment International, Houston, were sold to Essex Crane Inc., and the assets of Elgin Electronics, Erie, Pa., were sold to closely held Charter Technologies Inc. 
17/wsj_1755:In 1900, for instance, less than 8% of assets went into bank deposits.
17/wsj_1755:Pension reserves, on the other hand, made up a relatively small part of household assets until the last decade, when they skyrocketed.
17/wsj_1755:And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets -- thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms. 
17/wsj_1755:That's some of what emerges from the following charts, which show how Americans have changed their investment patterns over the past 90 years.
17/wsj_1755:Housing, for instance, has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade -- although common wisdom would have expected an increase. "There is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth," says Edward N. Wolff, professor of economics at New York University. "But it hasn't increased much relative to other assets.
17/wsj_1755:It suggests that households accumulate wealth across a broad spectrum of assets.
17/wsj_1755:In addition, investors' desire to hold stocks -- directly and through mutual funds -- has held surprisingly steady; stocks' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market, and not a shift in stock-holding preferences. "Stocks have not spread to the general public, despite the fact that the environment is much different," concludes Robert Avery, an economist at Cornell University. "To me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets, we have ways of holding wealth similar to 100 years ago." 
17/wsj_1755:The main components of the various asseet categories: 
17/wsj_1755:Bank Deposits: Currency, checking-account deposits, small savings and time deposits, certificates of deposits, money-market fund shares. 
17/wsj_1756:McCaw is seeking 50.3% of the cellular and broadcasting concern; the revised offer includes a feature requiring McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN. 
17/wsj_1756:The letter outlines broad powers for an independent group of directors provided for in the revised offer.
17/wsj_1756:In a statement, Craig O. McCaw, chairman and chief executive officer of McCaw, said: "We trust LIN will take no further actions that favor BellSouth." 
17/wsj_1756:Independent directors would be able to block transactions they unanimously deem would be likely to depress the private market value of LIN at the time it is to be sold in five years. 
17/wsj_1757:The entertainment concern said the success of several movies released during the quarter, including "Parenthood" and "Uncle Buck," contributed to record revenue for its film unit.
17/wsj_1757:The parent company's net included a loss -- which it didn't specify -- that was related to the company's 50% stake in Cineplex Odeon Corp. Cineplex, a Toronto theater chain, had a second-quarter net loss of $38.7 million. 
17/wsj_1757:MCA said net also included certain reserves related to the restructuring of its LJN Toys' international operations.
17/wsj_1757:These items were partly offset, MCA said, by an unspecified gain on the sale of its Miller International unit, a maker and distributor of budget-priced audio cassettes. 
17/wsj_1759:The insurance brokerage agency, just a fragment of Helmsley's vast empire, would be the first piece of the company to be stripped away since last summer when Mr. Helmsley's wife, Leona Helmsley, was found guilty of tax evasion. 
17/wsj_1759:Industry sources estimate the agency brokers property and casualty premiums worth about $25 million annually, and has revenue, based on a standard 10% commission rate, of about $2.5 million.
17/wsj_1759:Many of the properties are owned through limited partnerships controlled by Mr. Helmsley. 
17/wsj_1759:New York State law prohibits insurance brokerages from deriving more than 10% of revenue from insuring affiliated companies.
17/wsj_1759:However, individuals close to the company insist shuttering the insurance division, a sideline from the company's core property management business, isn't the beginning of a sale of assets. 
17/wsj_1759:Frank B. Hall Inc. of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. is reportedly working out an agreement with Helmsley.
17/wsj_1760:Outside the white-walled headquarters of the socalled Society of Orange Workers, all seems normal in South Africa's abnormal society. 
17/wsj_1760:A pickup truck driven by a white farmer rumbles past with a load of black workers bouncing in the back.
17/wsj_1760:But inside the white walls of the Orange Workers' office -- just about the largest building in town, save for the Dutch Reformed Church and the school -- South Africa's neat racial order is awry.
17/wsj_1760:"If we want to have our own nation, then we must be willing to do all the work ourselves," says Hendrik Verwoerd Jr., son of the former prime minister and the leader of the Orange Workers, founded in 1980. 
17/wsj_1760:The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of South Africa, with Johannesburg opening its public facilities to all races, blacks storming the all-white beaches of the Cape and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned African National Congress.
17/wsj_1760:But here in Morgenzon, a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal, the Orange Workers are holding the pillars steady. 
17/wsj_1760:The Orange Workers -- who take their name from William of Orange of the Netherlands, a hero of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners -- believe that the solution to South Africa's racial problems isn't the abolition of apartheid, it's the perfection of apartheid -- complete and total separation of the races. 
17/wsj_1760:But their ideal of an Afrikaner homeland, an all-white reserve to be carved out of present-day South Africa, is a mainstream desire of the right-wing, which embraces about one-third of the country's five million whites.
17/wsj_1760:On Main Street, Alida Verwoerd and her daughters look after the clothes and fabric shop, then hurry home to fix lunch for the rest of the family.
17/wsj_1760:Down by the stream, a group of Orange Workers puts the finishing touches on a golf course.
17/wsj_1760:"If we want to survive as a people," he says, "we have to change our way of life.
17/wsj_1760:In their quest to perfect apartheid, the Orange Workers have discovered a truth that most of privileged white South Africa tries mightily to deny: The master can't become dependent on the slave and expect to remain master forever. 
17/wsj_1760:He is sitting in his living room, beneath a huge portrait of his late father, Hendrik F. Verwoerd, apartheid's architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966.
17/wsj_1760:"People took separate development as an opportunity to use black labor without ever getting rid of it.
17/wsj_1760:Morgenzon has long been a special domain of Afrikanerdom.
17/wsj_1760:Today, Morgenzon is a town of 800 whites and two paved roads.
17/wsj_1760:Just beyond the city limits is a shantytown of 2,000 blacks who are employed throughout the area.
17/wsj_1760:Despite the Orange Workers' intention to put them all out of work, they are in no hurry to leave.
17/wsj_1760:A young man called July (that's when he was born), who works at the railroad station just up the street from the Orange Workers office, points at the whitewalled building and says matter-of-factly, "We're not allowed in there, that's all I know." 
17/wsj_1760:Try as they might, they just can't conceive of life without black workers. 
17/wsj_1760:Over at the Shell station, owner Rudi van Dyk, who doubles as Morgenzon's mayor, worries that the Orange Workers have made his town the laughingstock of the nation. "What they want us to do just isn't practical," he says, noting that he employs 16 blacks. "I couldn't afford to hire 16 whites.
17/wsj_1760:Back at the Verwoerd house, Hendrik Sr. peers down over the shoulder of Hendrik Jr.
17/wsj_1760:The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no turning back the integration of South African society and politics, Morgenzon will boom. 
17/wsj_1760:"We urge our people not to wait until they have to fight for their own nation," says Mr. Verwoerd. "By populating a place now, we make ourselves a power any new government will have to take into account." Curiously, he compares the Orange Workers to the ANC, which his father outlawed in 1960. "The ANC won't be stopped until there is a provision for black aspirations," says Mr. Verwoerd. "Likewise, no government will stop this idea of the Afrikaners." 
17/wsj_1760:He apologizes for sounding pushy. "Look," he says, "If the rest of South Africa wants to have an integrated melting pot, that's their choice.
17/wsj_1760:We just want to have our own cup of tea." And they will even serve it themselves. 
17/wsj_1761:Now, with a semblance of normalcy returning, some advisers say it's time for investors to take a hard, cold look at the stocks they own and consider some careful pruning. 
17/wsj_1761:Alan Weston, president of Weston Capital Management, a Los Angeles money-management firm, adds that in periods of uncertainty like today, "it's a good time to cut out the dead branches of your portfolio." 
17/wsj_1761:Not everybody agrees that it's time to trim. "We aren't inclined to prune stock portfolios now," says Steven G. Einhorn, chairman of the investment policy committee of Goldman, Sachs & Co. "Investors should stay with their stocks.
17/wsj_1761:GET RID OF THE DOGS. "Sell stocks that aren't doing well now, and that don't have good earnings prospects," says Alfred Goldman, technical analyst at St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards & Sons. "Most people do just the opposite: They sell their winners and keep their losers." Which types of stocks are most likely to qualify?
17/wsj_1761:John Markese, director of research for the American Association of Individual Investors, raises a cautionary note. "Substituting a rule of thumb for your own judgment" can be a mistake, he says.
17/wsj_1761:But Mr. Clough says, "The risk is that earnings disappointments will continue." The economy is decelerating after six good years, and "right now it's better to shoot first and ask questions later." Which types of stocks currently have the greatest earnings risks?
17/wsj_1761:BEWARE OF HEAVY DEBT.
17/wsj_1761:The companies apt to run into earnings problems soonest are the ones with heavy debt loads, says Larry Biehl, partner in the San Mateo, Calif., money-management firm of Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser.
17/wsj_1761:Mr. Canelo of Bear Stearns agrees: "If we do have an economic slowdown," he says, "companies with high debt ratios will be dumped en masse." The best course for individual investors is to sell these stocks now, the two advisers say. 
17/wsj_1761:COMPARE P/E RATIOS WITH PROSPECTS. Mr. Canelo suggests that investors compare price/earnings ratios (the price of a share of stock divided by a company's per-share earnings for a 12-month period) with projected growth rates. "If you think earnings will grow at 20% a year, it's all right to pay 20 times earnings," he says. "But don't pay 30 times earnings for a company that's expected to grow at 15% a year." 
17/wsj_1761:Say you purchased a stock because of a new product that was in the works.
17/wsj_1761:Now, because of various difficulties, the product has been scrapped.
17/wsj_1761:Similarly, he says, suppose you were attracted to a company because of expectations that sales would hit $200 million by 1990.
17/wsj_1762:USX Corp. declined a United Steelworkers request for a reopening of its four-year labor contract that is due to expire Jan. 31, 1991. 
17/wsj_1762:The union on Oct. 5 requested that the contract be reopened to restore all pay and benefits that the union gave up in the 1982-83 and 1986-87 rounds of bargaining. 
17/wsj_1762:A United Steelworkers spokeman said Lynn Williams, the union's president, was out of town.
17/wsj_1763:Robert A. Oswald, chief financial officer and a director of this natural-gas pipeline company, was elected to the additional position of executive vice president.
17/wsj_1763:In addition, Michael W. O'Donnell, executive vice president of a Columbia unit, was named assistant chief financial officer and a senior vice president of the parent company.
17/wsj_1764:They are: James R. Eiszner, 62 years old and chairman and chief executive officer of CPC International Inc.; Robert G. Schwartz, 61, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., and Walter V. Shipley, 53, chairman and chief executive officer of Chemical Banking Corp. 
17/wsj_1765:All but eight of the 850 branches, which had some structural damage, reopened yesterday for business.
17/wsj_1765:The provision rate was far above BankAmerica's actual net credit losses of $24 million in the third quarter, compared with $18 million in the second period and $38 million a year earlier. 
17/wsj_1765:As a result, BankAmerica said its reserve against troubled foreign-country loans, once below 25%, now amounts to 45% of the $6.4 billion of non-trade debt it calculates it is owed by those nations.
17/wsj_1765:That level is about the same as some other big banks, but far below the 85% and 100% reserves of Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co., respectively. 
17/wsj_1765:By that key measure of operating efficiency, BankAmerica turned in a better performance than its well-regarded Los Angeles-based competitor, Security Pacific Corp., which posted a 0.89% return in the third quarter.
17/wsj_1766:International Business Machines Corp. will announce on Tuesday a slew of software products aimed at eliminating some of the major problems involved in computerizing manufacturing operations, industry executives said. 
17/wsj_1766:Many plant floors currently resemble a Tower of Babel, with computers, robots and machine tools that generally speak their own language and have trouble talking to each other.
17/wsj_1766:As a result, if a problem develops on a production line, it is unlikely some supervisor sitting in front of a personal computer or workstation will know about it or be able to correct it. 
17/wsj_1766:In an unusual display of openness, IBM also will be helping customers tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by IBM's competitors. 
17/wsj_1766:Also as usual, the products will appeal mostly to heavy users of IBM equipment, at least initially. 
17/wsj_1766:He added, though, that "a lot of this is intentions. . . . We'll have to wait and see" how the plan develops. 
17/wsj_1766:While IBM has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools, Digital has dominated computerized manufacturing.
17/wsj_1766:In addition, Hewlett-Packard, while a much smaller player, has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those hookups and could give IBM some problems.
17/wsj_1766:Both can be expected to go after the market aggressively: Gartner Group Inc., a research firm, estimated the Digital gets 30% of its revenue from the manufacturing market, and Hewlett-Packard gets 50%. 
17/wsj_1766:IBM, which Gartner Group said generates 22% of its revenue in this market, should be able to take advantage of its loyal following among buyers of equipment.
17/wsj_1766:That is because many companies will standardize on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge, and IBM is the biggest player.
17/wsj_1766:The whole idea of computer-integrated manufacturing, CIM, seems to be making a comeback after losing a little luster over the past couple of years when it became apparent that it wasn't a panacea that would make U.S. plants more efficient and banish foreign competition. 
17/wsj_1766:Erik Keller, a Gartner Group analyst, said organizational changes may still be required to really take advantage of CIM's capabilities -- someone on the shop floor may not like having someone in an office using a personal computer to look over his shoulder, for instance, and may be able to prevent that from happening.
17/wsj_1766:In making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips, for instance, a chip sometimes doesn't melt, gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets.
17/wsj_1766:They could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing to accept a lower grade of polyethylene.
17/wsj_1766:This sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant weapon for some companies.
17/wsj_1767:Ford said yesterday it will halt imports of the Merkur Scorpio, a $28,000 luxury sedan built by Ford of Europe in West Germany.
17/wsj_1767:The cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of Lincoln-Mercury dealers -- as opposed to new models such as Taurus or Escort, which are sold under existing Ford divisions. 
17/wsj_1767:Still, Merkur's demise is a setback for Ford at a time when the company's image as the U.S. auto maker with the golden touch is showing signs of strain. 
17/wsj_1767:This fall, Ford introduced only one new product: A restyled version of its hulking Lincoln Town Car luxury model. 
17/wsj_1767:The demise of Merkur (pronounced mare-COOR) comes after a September in which 670 Merkur dealers managed to sell only 93 Scorpios.
17/wsj_1767:Merkur, as an import on domestic car lots, suffered from the same sort of image confusion that is hobbling sales of imports at General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. 
17/wsj_1767:Merkur was originally aimed at enticing into Lincoln-Mercury dealerships the kind of young, affluent buyers who wouldn't be caught dead in a Town Car -- a vehicle so bargelike that Ford is staging a press event next month linking the Town Car's launch to the commissioning of a new aircraft carrier in Norfolk, Va. 
17/wsj_1767:One major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark, which began less than a year after Merkur's 1985 launch.
17/wsj_1767:The Merkur cars also suffered from spotty quality, some dealers say. "It was like a comedy of errors," says Martin J. "Hoot" McInerney, a big dealer whose Star Lincoln-Mercury-Merkur operation in Southfield, Mich., sold more XR4Ti's than any other dealership.
17/wsj_1767:But by the third quarter of 1988, Scorpios had a high satisfaction rating in internal Ford studies, a spokesman said. 
17/wsj_1767:Last fall, Ford announced it would discontinue the XR4Ti in the U.S. at the end of the 1989 model year.
17/wsj_1767:This year, Scorpio sales plummeted, and at the current sales pace it would take Ford 242 days to sell off the current Scorpio inventory of about 4,600 cars. 
17/wsj_1768:Canadian Pacific Ltd. said it proposed acquiring the 44% of Soo Line Corp. it doesn't already own for $19.50 a share, or about $81.9 million, after failing to find a buyer for its majority stake earlier this year. 
17/wsj_1768:Soo Line said its board appointed a special committee of independent directors to study the proposal.
17/wsj_1768:Canadian Pacific, which has interests in transportation, telecommunications, forest products, energy and real estate, finally took its majority block off the market this spring. "It turned out we couldn't sell it," a Canadian Pacific official said, adding that acquiring the remainder of Soo Line is now "the best way to rationalize operations." 
17/wsj_1768:Separately, for the first nine months, Soo Line reported a loss of $398,000, or four cents a share, compared with net income of $12.5 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier.
17/wsj_1768:The company had a loss from operations of $1.7 million. 
17/wsj_1769:Golden Nugget Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $13.1 million, or 76 cents a share, based on 17.2 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding.
17/wsj_1769:The results compare with a year-earlier net loss of $1.5 million, or seven cents a share, based on 20.3 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding. 
17/wsj_1769:Results for the latest quarter include nonoperating items of $23.9 million, versus $8.4 million a year earlier.
17/wsj_1769:Most of the expenses stem from the company's huge Mirage resort-casino scheduled to open next month along the Strip, and an April 1989 financing by units operating the downtown Golden Nugget property. 
17/wsj_1769:For the nine months, Golden Nugget reported a net loss of $11.4 million, or 69 cents a share, based on 16.6 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding.
17/wsj_1769:The year earlier, the company had a net loss of $4.3 million, or 20 cents a share, based on 21 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding.
17/wsj_1770:Capital Holding Corp. said it requested and received the resignation of John A. Franco, its vice chairman, as an officer and a director of the life insurance holding company. 
17/wsj_1770:The group temporarily will report to Irving W. Bailey II, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Capital Holding. 
17/wsj_1770:Mr. Franco, 47 years old, said in a telephone interview that he has been considering and discussing a number of possible business ventures, but that "nothing is at a mature stage." He said he "didn't argue with" the company's decision to seek his resignation because contemplating outside business ventures can distract an executive from performing his best "at the job he is paid to do." 
17/wsj_1770:Martin H. Ruby, a managing director of Capital Holding's Accumulation and Investment Group, also resigned to pursue other business interests, Capital Holding said. 
17/wsj_1770:Mr. Ruby, 39, said that he had "an amicable parting" with Capital Holding and that he has "a number of ventures in the financial-services area" under consideration.
17/wsj_1770:The Accumulation and Investment Group is responsible for the investment operations of all Capital Holding's insurance businesses and markets guaranteed investment contracts to bank trust departments and other institutions.
17/wsj_1772:(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 
17/wsj_1772:Eagle Pencil of Shelbyville, Tenn., "Pencil City U.S.A.," had made its earliest pilot plastic pencils in 1971.
17/wsj_1772:Pencil pushers chew and put the plastic models behind their ears just like traditional pencils made of glued strips of California incense cedar filled with ceramic lead.
17/wsj_1772:The softness of the core constrains the plastic models to No. 1, No. 2 or No. 3-type pencils, which account for the bulk of the market.
17/wsj_1773:H.F. Ahmanson, parent of Home Savings of America, reported third-quarter net of $49.2 million, or 50 cents a share, down from $56.1 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 
17/wsj_1773:Most of the earnings decline reflected an increase in the company's effective tax rate to 44% from 37% in the year-ago third quarter when nonrecurring tax credits were recorded, the company said.
17/wsj_1773:For the nine months, Los Angeles-based H. F. Ahmanson had profit of $128.1 million, or $1.29 a share, a 4.6% decline from earnings of $134.2 million in the year-ago nine months.
17/wsj_1773:Margins are the difference between the yield on the company's earning assets and its own cost of funds. 
17/wsj_1773:But a reduction in one-time gains on the sale of various assets and an increase in the company's provision for loan losses held down the earnings gain, the company said.
17/wsj_1773:Great Western's provision for loan losses was increased to $27.9 million for the recent quarter compared with $21.8 million a year ago primarily as a result of "continued weakness in various commercial and multifamily real estate markets outside California." 
17/wsj_1773:For the nine months Great Western posted net of $177.5 million, or $1.37 a share, a 5.9% decline from $188.7 million, or $1.48 a share, in the year-ago period. 
17/wsj_1774:But revenue declined more than 2%, reflecting in part a continuing drop in sales of credit services in the wake of controversy over the company's sales practices.
17/wsj_1774:The information company also cited the stronger dollar, the sale last year of its former Official Airline Guides unit and other factors. 
17/wsj_1774:Analysts said the results were as expected, but several added that the earnings masked underlying weaknesses in several businesses. "The quality of earnings wasn't as high as I expected," said Eric Philo, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Co. 
17/wsj_1774:For example, he noted, operating profit was weaker than he had anticipated, but nonoperating earnings of $14.6 million and a lower tax rate helped boost net income. 
17/wsj_1774:Dun & Bradstreet said operating earnings rose 8%, excluding the sale of Official Airline Guides. 
17/wsj_1774:Third-quarter sales of U.S. credit services were "disappointingly below sales" of a year earlier, Dun & Bradstreet said.
17/wsj_1774:As previously reported, those sales have been declining this year in the wake of allegations that the company engaged in unfair sales practices that encouraged customers to overpurchase services.
17/wsj_1774:The company has denied the allegations but has negotiated a proposed $18 million settlement of related lawsuits.
17/wsj_1774:Year-earlier earnings reflected costs of $14.3 million related to the acquisition of IMS International.
17/wsj_1775:Control Data will receive revenue linked to the number of passengers served by the software, IATA said. 
17/wsj_1775:The package helps carriers solve pricing problems, such as how to react to discounts offered by competitors or what would be the optimum number of seats to offer at a given price. 
17/wsj_1776:Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said it decided to proceed with installation of automatic gauge and shape controls at its 60-inch tandem cold rolling mill in Allenport, Pa. 
17/wsj_1777:Sir Richard Butler, 60-year-old chairman of Agricola (U.K.) Ltd., was named chairman of County NatWest Investment Management Ltd., the investment management subsidiary of County NatWest Ltd., the investment banking arm of this British bank.
17/wsj_1778:Some found it on the screen of a personal computer. 
17/wsj_1778:Hundreds of Californians made their way to their computers after the quake, and checked in with each other on electronic bulletin boards, which link computers CB-radio-style, via phone lines. 
17/wsj_1778:Some of the most vivid bulletins came over The Well, a Sausalito, Calif., board that is one of the liveliest outposts of the electronic underground.
17/wsj_1778:About two-thirds of the Well's 3,000 subscribers live in the Bay Area. 
17/wsj_1778:11:54 p.m. JCKC: Wow! I was in the avenues, on the third floor of an old building, and except for my heart (Beat, BEAT!) I'm OK. Got back to Bolinas, and everything had fallen: broken poster frames with glass on the floor, file cabinets open or dumped onto the floor. 
17/wsj_1778:Then the auto paint shop fire sent an evil-looking cloud of black smoke into the air. 
17/wsj_1778:A lot of car alarms went off.
17/wsj_1778:12:15 a.m. DHAWK: Huge fire from broken gas main in the Marina in SF. Areas that are made of `fill' liquefy.
17/wsj_1778:A woman in a three-story apartment was able to walk out the window of the third floor onto street level after the quake.
17/wsj_1778:12:38 a.m. DAYAC: I was driving my truck, stopped at a red light at the corner of Shattuck and Alcatraz at the Oakland-Berkeley border when it hit.
17/wsj_1778:1:00 a.m. HEYNOW: I rode it out on the second floor of Leo's at 55th and Telegraph in Oakland.
17/wsj_1778:I heard parts of the building above my head cracking.
17/wsj_1778:There was a horrible smell of gas as I passed the Chevron refinery before crossing the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.
17/wsj_1778:I could also see the clouds across the bay from the horrible fire in the Marina District of San Francisco. 
17/wsj_1778:I think a few of the aftershocks might just be my body shaking. 
17/wsj_1778:3:25 a.m. MACPOST: Downtown Bolinas seems to be the part of town that's worst off.
17/wsj_1778:No power, minimal phones, and a mess of mayonnaise, wine, and everything else all over the floors of the big old general store and the People's Co-op.
17/wsj_1778:Everyone looked calm, but there was this surreal low level of confusion as the aftershocks continued. 
17/wsj_1778:4:02 a.m. SHIBUMI: Power is back on, and UCSF {medical center} seems to have quieted down for the night (they were doing triage out in the parking lot from the sound and lights of it).
17/wsj_1778:A friend of mine was in an underground computer center in downtown SF when the quake hit.
17/wsj_1778:He said that one of the computers took a three-foot trip sliding across the floor. 
17/wsj_1778:When I realized it was over, I went and stood out in front of the house, waiting and praying for Merrill to come home, shivering as if it were 20 below zero until he got there.
17/wsj_1778:When I saw the pictures of 880 and the Bay Bridge, I began to cry. 
17/wsj_1778:5:09 a.m. JROE: The Sunset {District} was more or less like a pajama party all evening, lots of people & dogs walking around, drinking beer. 
17/wsj_1778:The three of us stopped breathing for a moment, and then when it kept on coming we lunged for the doorway.
17/wsj_1778:Kitchen full of broken crystal.
17/wsj_1779:Per-share earnings were enhanced by the company's share buy-back program, which reduced the average shares outstanding to 87.5 million in the quarter from 95.8 million in the same quarter of 1988. 
17/wsj_1779:But the performance exceeded some estimates of around $1.90 a share. 
17/wsj_1780:On Monday, a letter from Mr. Skinner's deputy, Elaine Chao, said the administration opposed the legislation "in its present form." Some of the bill's supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter wasn't signed by Mr. Skinner and that it didn't contain a veto threat. 
17/wsj_1780:Under the committee bill, the Transportation secretary would have 30 days, and an additional 20 days if needed, to review any proposed purchase of 15% or more of a major U.S. airline's voting stock.
17/wsj_1780:Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline, it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt.
17/wsj_1780:Supporters of the bill are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt. 
17/wsj_1780:"It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort," Rep. James Oberstar (D., Minn.), chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee, said during the panel's deliberations. "I don't believe in the airline business you can be totally laissez-faire because of the high degree of public interest" at stake. 
17/wsj_1780:But Mr. Skinner disagreed, calling the legislation "a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry." In his letter to Committee Chairman Glenn Anderson (D., Calif.), the secretary also said the bill "would be at odds with the administration's policies welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources." 
17/wsj_1780:Such authority is more than adequate, say opponents of the legislation.
17/wsj_1780:The panel rejected a proposal pushed by AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, to allow the Transportation secretary to block corporate raiders from waging proxy fights to oust boards that oppose a leveraged buy-out.
17/wsj_1780:It also voted down proposals to give the secretary much more discretion on whether to block a buy-out and to require the department to consider the impact of a buy-out on workers. 
17/wsj_1781:In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index jumped 34.6 points to close at its intraday high of 2170.1.
17/wsj_1781:The index was under pressure for most of the morning over concerns that the effects of Tuesday night's major earthquake in the San Francisco area would undermine the U.S. market.
17/wsj_1781:The mood changed after dealers reappraised the direct impact of the disaster on shares and Wall Street rebounded from early losses. 
17/wsj_1781:Volume was 449.3 million shares, the slowest of a hectic week, compared with 643.4 million Tuesday. 
17/wsj_1781:The insurers' relative resilience gave the market time to reappraise the impact of the California disaster on U.K. equities, dealers said. 
17/wsj_1781:Dealers said the market still hasn't shaken off its nervousness after its bumpy ride of the past several sessions, caused by interest-rate increases last week and Wall Street's 6.9% plunge Friday.
17/wsj_1781:But technical factors, including modest gains in the value of the pound, helped draw buying back into the market and reverse losses posted a day earlier. 
17/wsj_1781:NatWest, the most actively traded of the banks, finished at 300, up 1. 
17/wsj_1781:Dealers said the market was nervous ahead of a special B.A.T holders' meeting today.
17/wsj_1781:Trading was suspended in WCRS Group, a U.K. advertising concern, pending an announcement that it is buying the remaining 50% of France's Carat Holding for 2.02 billion French francs ($318.7 million) and expanding commercial and equity ties with advertising group Eurocom. 
17/wsj_1781:Jaguar advanced 19 to 673 as traders contemplated a potential battle between General Motors and Ford Motor for control of the U.K. luxury auto maker. 
17/wsj_1781:Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 111.48 points, or 0.32%, to 35107.56.
17/wsj_1781:The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first section, which gained 41.76 Tuesday, was up 0.24 points, or 0.01%, at 2642.88. 
17/wsj_1781:On Wednesday, shares were pushed up by index-related buying on the part of investment trusts as well as small orders from individuals and corporations, traders said. 
17/wsj_1781:Institutions, meanwhile, stepped back to the sidelines as the direction of U.S. interest rates remained unclear.
17/wsj_1781:The uncertainty was multiplied by the persistent strength of the dollar, traders said, and by the U.S. trade deficit, which widened by 31% in August from the previous month. 
17/wsj_1781:Buying was scattered across a wide range of issues, making the session fairly characterless, traders said.
17/wsj_1781:Some traders said the popularity of issues that gained yesterday won't last long, as investors will rotate their buying choices over the short term. 
17/wsj_1781:Its popularity was due to speculation about the strong earnings potential of a new type of plastic wrap for household use, a trader at County Natwest Securities Japan said. 
17/wsj_1781:Most of those markets had rebounded the day before from Monday's slide.
17/wsj_1781:Trading had been impeded by a major computer failure that took place before the start of Monday's session. 
17/wsj_1781:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
17/wsj_1782:Work began on homes and apartments at an annual rate of 1,263,000 units last month, down 5.2% from August, the department said.
17/wsj_1782:The September decline followed an even steeper drop of 6.2% in August and left housing starts at their weakest since October 1982, when the country was nearing the end of a recession.
17/wsj_1782:The numbers suggest that the housing industry is still suffering the effects of the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation.
17/wsj_1782:The industry had shown signs of recovery this summer, after the central bank began to relax its clamp on credit, allowing interest rates to drop a bit after pushing them up for a year.
17/wsj_1782:Sales of new homes rose and inventories of houses, which had been climbing, dropped. 
17/wsj_1782:But last month new construction in all types of homes waned, from single-family houses to large apartment complexes. 
17/wsj_1782:"It's pretty much weak across the board," said Martin Regalia, chief economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions. 
17/wsj_1782:Mr. Regalia said the industry may be reluctant to step up building at the moment for fear the inventories of unsold homes will increase again. 
17/wsj_1782:"Rates haven't really peeled off that much," Mr. Regalia said. "We've kind of settled now into an interest-rate environment that's fairly high." 
17/wsj_1782:Work was begun on single family homes -- the core of the housing market -- at an annual rate of 971,000 in September, a drop of 2.1% from the previous month.
17/wsj_1782:Construction of apartments and other multi-family dwellings slipped 2.2% to an annual rate of 1,022,000 following a 3.5% decline in August. 
17/wsj_1782:The number of building permits issued for future construction dropped 2.4% to a 1,296,000 annual rate after rising 3.7% in August. 
17/wsj_1782:The housing starts numbers, however, are one of the least precise of the government's economic indicators and are often revised significantly as more information is collected. 
17/wsj_1783:The securities firm posted third-quarter net of $66 million, or 64 cents a share, compared with a restated year-earlier loss of $3 million, or 11 cents a share. 
17/wsj_1783:The latest period included the gain, which was $77 million before tax, from the previously announced sale of the institutional money management business of Lehman Management Co.
17/wsj_1783:The 1988 period was restated from net income of $8 million to correct an overstatement in the company's Boston Co. subsidiary. 
17/wsj_1783:In the 1989 second quarter, Shearson had net income of $55 million, or 54 cents a share.
17/wsj_1783:Investment banking revenue fell 32% to $205 million, in part reflecting the continued slowdown of the underwriting business. 
17/wsj_1784:Schering-Plough Corp., based in Madison, N.J., reported a 21% rise in earnings as American Home Products Corp. of New York posted an 11% increase in net. 
17/wsj_1784:Sales of health-care products increased 6% in the third quarter, based in part on strong sales of prescription drugs such as Premarin, an estrogen-replacement drug, and sales of the company's infant formula. 
17/wsj_1784:American Home Products said net income benefited from a "lower effective tax rate," reflecting a reduction of foreign tax rates, and additional operations in Puerto Rico.
17/wsj_1784:Net also was aided by a gain on the sale of the company's equity interests in South Africa effective Sept. 1. 
17/wsj_1784:The company said net income was flat because of investment in research and development and costs related to launches of several products. 
17/wsj_1784:In the health-care segment, pharmaceutical sales increased 4% and sales of hospital products increased 1%.
17/wsj_1784:During the quarter, Pfizer received federal approval of Procardia XL, a calcium channel blocker approved for both angina and hypertension, and Monorail Piccolino, used to open obstructed coronary arteries. 
17/wsj_1784:In the period, the company completed the sale of its European cosmetics businesses, sold a majority interest in its Brazilian affiliate, and announced the reorganization of its over-the-counter drug businesses into a new unit, Schering-Plough Health Care Products.
17/wsj_1784:These actions didn't affect results because the gain on the sale of the European cosmetics businesses was offset by provisions relating to the Brazil divestiture and drug restructuring. 
17/wsj_1784:World-wide consumer product sales declined 12%, primarily because of the European cosmetics sale.
17/wsj_1784:Significantly lower sales of `Stay Trim' diet aids also were a factor in the drop.
17/wsj_1785:Swedish auto and aerospace concern Saab-Scania AB said it received a 250 million krona ($39 million) order from Swiss Crossair, one of Europe's leading regional air companies, for five Saab 340B turboprop commuter aircraft. 
17/wsj_1786:Not mentioned were the 50,000 people rendered homeless, and the more than 200,000 out of work for an indeterminable period; the $1 billion-plus in losses to homes and personal property on the barrier islands; the near- and long-term impact on the state's largest industry, tourism, not to mention the human suffering. 
17/wsj_1786:In centering on the disruption of a few proud local customs such as the historichomes tour and the damage to the antiquities, your reporter served to only perpetuate an outdated and stereotypically provincial view of this otherwise thriving port city.
17/wsj_1786:The damage will undoubtedly prove to be one of the epic human and economic disasters of the decade in this country. 
17/wsj_1786:Depicting the people of a traumatized city reeling from a disaster of unprecedented proportions was at the very best ludicrous under the circumstances.
17/wsj_1786:Your narrow focus appears to be a contrived attempt to show the people of that historic city to be doddering fools. 
17/wsj_1786:You had to have been blind not to see the scenario there for what it was and is and will continue to be for months and even years -- a part of South Carolina that has sustained a blow that the Red Cross expects will cost that organization alone some $38 million. 
17/wsj_1786:Charlestonians are instead indomitable and have contributed mightily to the culture and history of our country for more than 300 years.
17/wsj_1787:Affiliated Bankshares of Colorado Inc. said it agreed to sell its 10% interest in Rocky Mountain Bankcard Systems for $18.5 million to Colorado National Bank of Denver and Central Bank of Denver. 
17/wsj_1787:Colorado National is a unit of Colorado National Bankshares Inc. and Central is a unit of First Bank System of Minneapolis. 
17/wsj_1787:Affiliated said it expects to record a pretax gain of about $18.5 million from the sale of the credit-card business, which should more than offset any reduction in the carrying value of real estate and real-estate loans on its books. 
17/wsj_1788:The U.S. Export-Import Bank tentatively decided to guarantee commercial bank financing for the purchase of two Boeing Co. 767 airliners by Avianca, Colombia's international airline, at a cost of about $150 million. 
17/wsj_1788:The loan guarantee would amount to about $127.5 million, or 85% of the cost of the aircraft. 
17/wsj_1788:Because of the size of the proposed loan guarantee, the Ex-Im Bank's preliminary commitment is subject to review by the House and Senate Banking committees.
17/wsj_1789:President Carlos Salinas de Gortari used the army to oust La Quina, who reigned for 28 years over a graft-riddled empire that made state-run Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, one of the world's most inefficient oil companies.
17/wsj_1789:In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management, Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union's role in subcontracting, long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings.
17/wsj_1789:And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina, government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment. 
17/wsj_1789:Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas publicly questioned Mr. Guzman Cabrera's "moral quality," suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country's oil, a symbol of Mexican nationalism, to foreigners. 
17/wsj_1789:The 61-year-old Mr. Guzman Cabrera takes such criticisms in stride. "This isn't a new kind of union leadership, it's a new Mexico.
17/wsj_1789:We're no longer afraid of associating with private or foreign capital," he says. 
17/wsj_1789:Pemex, which produces 40% of government revenue, desperately needs new investment.
17/wsj_1789:A bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused Pemex's operating costs to balloon to 95 cents of each $1 in sales, far above the industry norm. 
17/wsj_1789:Some projections show Mexico importing crude by the end of the century, barring an overhaul of operations. "Whatever you tried to change, whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners, the big obstacle was the old union leadership," says oil consultant George Baker. 
17/wsj_1789:Enter Mr. Guzman Cabrera, who has a clear understanding of where union leaders fit in the pro-enterprise regime of President Salinas. "I'm the secretary-general, if there is one," he says, greeting a visitor to his office.
17/wsj_1789:Though he also long benefited from the system built by La Quina, Mr. Guzman Cabrera says union perks had simply gotten out of hand.
17/wsj_1789:They are "at the base of all of the problems of corruption," he says. 
17/wsj_1789:Thus, in recent contract negotiations, Mr. Guzman Cabrera gave up the union's right to assign 40% of all of Pemex's outside contracts -- an enormous source of kickbacks.
17/wsj_1789:The new contract also eliminates the $15 monthly coupon, good only at union-owned grocery stores, that was part of the salary of every worker, from roughneck to chief executive.
17/wsj_1789:Also, because of its reduced capital budget, Pemex has phased out about 50,000 transitory construction workers, reducing the work force to about 140,000, the union leader says.
17/wsj_1789:But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract. "We are retaking the instruments of administration," says Raul Robles, a Pemex subdirector.
17/wsj_1789:This year, for the first time, Desc and other customers were consulted well in advance of the Pemex plant's shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience. 
17/wsj_1789:But Pemex's courtship with private companies, and especially foreign ones, is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938. "They are preparing the workers for what's coming: foreign control," wrote Heberto Castillo, a leftist leader. 
17/wsj_1789:But the new union leader makes no apologies for Pemex's more outward-looking attitude. "If we do not integrate into this new world of interdependence, sooner or later we're going to become victims of our own isolation," he says. 
17/wsj_1790:His Levinson Institute in Belmont, Mass., has seen in recent years a doubling in the number of executives and spouses at its weeklong counseling program.
17/wsj_1790:And the vice president of a large Midwestern company realized that an abrasive temperament threatened his career when his wife confided that similar behavior at home harmed their marriage. 
17/wsj_1790:More dual-career couples also are getting help, with men increasingly bringing their working wives for joint counseling. "The level of stress for a woman is often so high, it's the husband who says, 'I'm worried about her, '" says psychologist Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz.
17/wsj_1790:Her Institute for Family and Work Relationships in La Jolla, Calif., has noted a doubling in the number of couples seeking help the past two years. 
17/wsj_1790:Power of Suggestion 
17/wsj_1790:HERE'S ONE more explanation for why Japan is a tough industrial competitor: Two of three Japanese employees submit suggestions to save money, increase efficiency and boost morale, while only 8% of American workers do. 
17/wsj_1790:Data for 1987 from the National Association of Suggestion Systems and the Japan Human Relations Association also indicate that Japanese employers adopt four of five suggestions, while their U.S. counterparts accept just one in four. 
17/wsj_1790:U.S. companies tend to favor suggestions "that go for the home runs," says Gary Floss, vice president of corporate quality at Control Data Corp. 
17/wsj_1790:That helps explain why American employers grant an average award of $604.72 per suggestion, while Japan's payment is $3.23.
17/wsj_1790:A Security magazine survey places the effect of takeovers and buy-outs among the industry's 10 biggest challenges. "If it causes management to take their eye off the ball, inventory shrinkage is going to be affected," says Lewis Shealy, vice president for loss prevention at Marshall Field's, the department store chain. 
17/wsj_1790:A separate study of the extent of employee misconduct linked general job satisfaction to property loss.
17/wsj_1790:Pilferage climbed dramatically as many angry employees "felt abandoned by the former owners," says the University of Florida sociologist. 
17/wsj_1790:But top management should watch for other tell-tale signs of employee misdeeds, like expense-account fudging and phone misuse.
17/wsj_1790:Security consultant Dennis Dalton of Ventura, Calif., thinks mergers often trigger longer lunch hours and increased absenteeism, conduct which can sap the bottom line more than thefts. 
17/wsj_1790:Consultant John Keller of Southlake, Texas, urges that top management adopt a "tough hands-on approach" with very tight controls and monitoring.
17/wsj_1790:Nearly seven of 10 investors think companies reinvest "too little" of their profits in the business.
17/wsj_1790:But both see a common enemy: About 66% of employees and 73% of investors think senior managers get too big a slice of the profit pie. 
17/wsj_1791:Bank of New York Co. said it agreed in principle to acquire the credit-card business of Houston-based First City Bancorp. of Texas for between $130 million and $134 million. 
17/wsj_1791:The move, subject to a definitive agreement, is part of a trend by big-city banks that have been buying up credit-card portfolios to expand their business.
17/wsj_1791:Just last month, a Bank of New York subsidiary agreed to buy the credit-card operation of Dreyfus Corp. 's Dreyfus Consumer Bank for $168 million, a transaction that is expected to be completed by the end of the year. 
17/wsj_1791:At the end of the third quarter, Bank of New York's credit-card business consisted of 2.4 million accounts with $3.6 billion in loans outstanding.
17/wsj_1791:Bank of New York is currently the seventh-largest issuer of credit cards in the 
17/wsj_1791:First City said that because of increased competition in the credit-card business, it had decided it either had to expand its own holdings substantially or sell them. "We think there's a good prospect that competition is going to get pretty fierce in this market," said James E. Day, a First City vice president. "We see it becoming a bargain-basement kind of business." 
17/wsj_1792:British Airways PLC said it is seeking improved terms and a sharply lower price in any revised bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. following the collapse of a $6.79 billion, $300-a-share buy-out bid. 
17/wsj_1792:Derek Stevens, British Air's chief financial officer, told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report a price of $230 a share is "certainly not too low," and indicated his company would like to reduce the size of its $750 million cash investment. 
17/wsj_1792:UAL fell $6.25 a share to $191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase. 
17/wsj_1792:Since then, UAL stock has fallen 33% in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever. 
17/wsj_1792:The tenor of Mr. Stevens's remarks seemed to indicate that British Air will take a more active, high-profile role in pursuing any new bid.
17/wsj_1792:He said he believes UAL management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction. 
17/wsj_1792:Mr. Stevens said British Air hasn't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group, led by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, and hasn't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming. "As far as we're concerned, we're waiting for the dust to settle," he said. 
17/wsj_1792:He said the original proposal is dead, and all aspects of a revised version are up for change, in light of the changes in UAL's market price, the amount of debt banks are willing to fund, and the price British Air would be willing to pay. 
17/wsj_1792:He added the original offer was "a pretty full price," and that British Air's contribution "was quite a large chunk for us." British Air was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a 15% stake in the company, but wasn't particularly happy with paying $750 million. 
17/wsj_1792:In any new proposal, British Air would expect a greater rate of return than the 20%-plus in the original proposal. 
17/wsj_1792:Roughly one-third of its stock is believed held by takeover stock traders, who could vote to oust the board if they become impatient. 
17/wsj_1792:Meanwhile, the buy-out group's task of holding its fragile coalition together, in the face of the bid's collapse and internal opposition from two other employee groups, has been further complicated by an apparent rift in the ranks of the pilot union itself. 
17/wsj_1792:A pilot representing a group of 220 pilots hired during United's 1985 strike filed suit Friday in Chicago federal court to block the takeover.
17/wsj_1792:UAL's management agreed to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the United pilot union for the buy-out proposal.
17/wsj_1792:The 220 pilots involved in the suit aren't members of the union.
17/wsj_1792:The airline had allowed them to move ahead of some union members in seniority following the 1985 strike, a move the union had contested in a previous lawsuit. 
17/wsj_1793:Corporate efforts to control health-care costs by requiring evaluations prior to planned hospitalization and surgery haven't been sweeping enough to reduce the long-term rate of cost increases, according to a study by the Institute of Medicine. 
17/wsj_1793:These programs vary widely, but often require second opinions on proposed surgery, preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods.
17/wsj_1793:Between 50% and 75% of today's workers are covered by such plans, up from 5% five years ago. 
17/wsj_1793:"Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers, utilization management -- like most other cost containment strategies -- doesn't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs," the Institute of Medicine, an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences, concluded after a two-year study. "Employers who saw a short-term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends." 
17/wsj_1793:While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs, these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs, according to the report by a panel of health-care experts. 
17/wsj_1793:The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow. "The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital, and not the actual need for a particular procedure, has been the main focus," the panel said. "As a general rule, prior-review programs have not made case-by-case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care." The report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines. 
17/wsj_1793:Howard Bailit, a panel member and a vice president of Aetna Life & Casualty, said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals. "There's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization," he said.
17/wsj_1793:David Rahill of A. Foster Higgins & Co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about 5%, but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole, some of these savings are offset by administrative and outpatient care costs. 
17/wsj_1793:Jerome Grossman, chairman of the panel, agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high. "You have a whole staff standing ready" to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment, he said.
17/wsj_1793:Dr. Grossman, who also is president of New England Medical Center Hospitals in Boston, noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than 100 utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements.
17/wsj_1793:The panel urged greater efforts to reduce the complexity, paperwork and cost of utilization review. 
17/wsj_1793:"Utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources, improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and providers," the panel concluded. 
17/wsj_1794:Renault and DAF Trucks NV announced a preliminary agreement to jointly manufacture a line of trucks in Britain and France. 
17/wsj_1794:Philippe Gras, a Renault managing director, said the new line will cover trucks of between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons and will be built at Renault's Bapilly plant in France and at DAF's British plant.
17/wsj_1794:The French state-controlled auto group and the Dutch truck maker plan to incorporate the new trucks into their product lines when they begin production toward the middle of the 1990s. 
17/wsj_1794:The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in Europe ahead of the 1992 deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the European Community. 
17/wsj_1794:Renault and DAF are expected to invest a total of about three billion French francs ($157.8 million) in the venture, including FFr1 billion for design and development costs.
17/wsj_1794:Mr. Gras said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF, since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles.
17/wsj_1794:Renault officials said the potential European market for light trucks in the 2.5-ton to 4.2-ton range is between 700,000 and 800,000 vehicles annually, and Renault and DAF are aiming for a combined market share of about 11%. 
17/wsj_1794:Both Renault and DAF will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks.
17/wsj_1794:The van Doorne family of the Netherlands holds an additional 11% of DAF's capital. 
17/wsj_1795:The Federal Reserve System is the standard object of suggestions for organizational and institutional changes, for two reasons. 
17/wsj_1795:It has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government's instruments -- the control of the money supply.
17/wsj_1795:Second, the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as guardian of the currency, which means as guardian of the stability of the price level, sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular.
17/wsj_1795:This leads to proposals for "reform" of the Fed, which have the common feature of making the Fed more responsive to the administration, to the Congress and to public opinion -- without, however, any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians.
17/wsj_1795:These proposals include changing the term of the chairman, shortening the terms of the members, eliminating the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks from the decision-making process, putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Federal Reserve Board, having the Fed audited by an arm of Congress (the General Accounting Office), putting the Fed's expenditures in the budget, and requiring prompt publication of the Fed's minutes.
17/wsj_1795:Some of these ideas are again under consideration in Congress. 
17/wsj_1795:But these proposals do not rest on a view of what the Fed's problem is or, if they do, they rest on an incorrect view.
17/wsj_1795:On the contrary, it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest. 
17/wsj_1795:Or, a wage that was $100 30 years ago would buy only $23.53 worth of stuff today.
17/wsj_1795:In each case the ending of this unsustainable inflation caused a severe recession -- the two worst of the postwar period. 
17/wsj_1795:At least, it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period.
17/wsj_1795:And that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the Federal Reserve. 
17/wsj_1795:The basic problem of monetary policy, to which reform of the Fed should be addressed, is to prevent a recurrence of this experience. 
17/wsj_1795:There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years: 
17/wsj_1795:Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors, one of the leading proposals today, is an example.
17/wsj_1795:The secretary is the world's biggest borrower of money.
17/wsj_1795:Moreover, he is a political agent of a political president, who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election, and less to its longer-run health.
17/wsj_1795:These days, the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be, which is a diversion from the real business of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the price level. 
17/wsj_1795:How should a reasonable member of the Federal Reserve Board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board?
17/wsj_1795:Or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents -- low interest rates, short-run economic expansion, and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels?
17/wsj_1795:(True, a succession of Fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the Secretary of the Treasury belongs on the Fed.
17/wsj_1795:By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew, in which case it is natural that the Fed and the Treasury, and probably also the Congress, should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot.
17/wsj_1795:The Fed's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the government.) 
17/wsj_1795:The Fed is responsive to, and cannot help being responsive to, the more overtly political part of the government.
17/wsj_1795:But Congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the Fed. 
17/wsj_1795:Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic.
17/wsj_1795:What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy, which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level.
17/wsj_1795:It also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale, because it leaves the Fed guessing about what are the expectations of its masters, the politicians, who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy. 
17/wsj_1795:The greatest contribution Congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System.
17/wsj_1795:It is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted, however.
17/wsj_1795:Congress would be required to make a hard decision, and Congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact. 
17/wsj_1795:And the Fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level. 
17/wsj_1795:The two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the Fed are high employment and rapid real growth.
17/wsj_1795:But the main lesson of economic policy in the past 30 years is that if the Fed compromises with the price-stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals, the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation. 
17/wsj_1795:A former chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Stein is an American Enterprise Institute fellow. 
17/wsj_1796:Republic New York Corp. joined the list of banks boosting reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries, setting out a $200 million provision and posting a $155.4 million third-quarter net loss as a result. 
17/wsj_1796:In the year earlier period, the New York parent of Republic National Bank had net income of $38.7 million, or $1.12 a share.
17/wsj_1796:The bank's medium-term and long-term loans to less-developed countries total $293 million, of which $146 million aren't accruing interest, the bank said.
17/wsj_1796:Republic's total of nonperforming assets was $167 million at Sept. 30, with its reserve for loan losses now standing at $357 million. 
17/wsj_1797:Legislation to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of 18 can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the Michigan legislature and set up a grinding battle to override the expected veto of Democratic Gov. James Blanchard. 
17/wsj_1797:The short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the debate in the next several months: the reawakening of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude, and the ability of each side to counter the other's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere. 
17/wsj_1797:The action in Pennsylvania, for example, will follow last week's collapse of a special session of the Florida legislature to enact restrictions on abortions in that state, and the vote here in Washington by the House to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest.
17/wsj_1797:But President Bush is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that, along with the easy approval of the Pennsylvania measure, is likely to mute the abortion-rights activists' claims of momentum and underline the challenges faced by this resurgent movement. 
17/wsj_1797:"It's great to feel good for once in 15 years," says Harrison Hickman, a consultant to abortion-rights advocates, reflecting the relief of his compatriots after last week's victories, the first major events since the Supreme Court, in its July 3 Webster decision, permitted the states to enact restrictions on abortions. "But how many more times we're going to feel good in the next 15 is another question." 
17/wsj_1797:The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania, where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature doesn't reflect the viewpoints of the state's citizens. 
17/wsj_1797:As a result, GOP state Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County, the legislature's leading foe of abortion, has been given all but free rein to press a strict seven-point plan to restrict abortion and, he hopes, to force the Supreme Court directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v.
17/wsj_1797:Wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place. 
17/wsj_1797:The Freind legislation -- the state's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday -- includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy, except to avert the death of the mother.
17/wsj_1797:Under this legislation, a woman must be informed 24 hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks. 
17/wsj_1797:"Regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion," Mr. Freind argues, "it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which, one way or the other, might remain with her for the rest of her life." 
17/wsj_1797:In Michigan, where the state Senate is expected to approve parental-consent legislation by the end of next week, Gov. Blanchard is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists.
17/wsj_1797:Susan Rogin, a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state, takes comfort from the fact that the state's House abortion opponents "haven't been able to muster the votes to overturn a veto on abortion in 16 years." But proponents believe they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents' rights. 
17/wsj_1797:Pamela Sutherland, executive director of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council, says she and her allies are "cautiously optimistic" they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote. 
17/wsj_1797:Abortion foes in Wisconsin, meanwhile, expect a parental-consent bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early November and are hopeful of prevailing in both houses by next March.
17/wsj_1797:In Texas, abortion opponents want to pass parental-consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds, personnel and facilities for abortion, and viability tests for fetuses 19 weeks and older.
17/wsj_1797:"The prognosis is only fair," says Kathie Roberts, administrative director of the Texas Right to Life Committee. "Next year is an election year and the legislators just don't want to do anything about this now." 
17/wsj_1797:At the same time, abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy, deciding to move on what Jacki Ragan, the National Right to Life Committee's director of state organizational development, calls "reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of Americans support." These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection, and the public funding of alternatives for abortion. "Those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves 'pro-choice' rather than `pro-abortion, '" says Mary Spaulding, the group's associate state legislative coordinator. 
17/wsj_1797:Over the weekend, the National Abortion Rights Action League singled out eight politicians, including Pennsylvania's Mr. Freind, as 1990 targets and held a Washington seminar designed to train its leaders in political techniques, including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures. "We now see pro-choice legislators going on the offensive for the first time," says Kate Michelman, executive director of the group. 
17/wsj_1799:This maker and marketer of cartridge tape systems said it completed the sale of 2.85 million shares of common priced at $10 a share in an initial public offering.
18/wsj_1800:Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the Senate, and the swift passage contrasted with months of negotiations over the underlying bill which is laced with special-interest provisions for both members and the executive branch. 
18/wsj_1800:More than $1.8 million is allocated for pensions and expenses for former presidents, and the budget for the official residence of Vice President Quayle is more than doubled, with $200,000 designated for improvements to the property.
18/wsj_1800:Even the Office of Management and Budget is remembered with an extra $1 million to help offset pay costs that other government departments are being asked to absorb. 
18/wsj_1800:Investigation and taxpayer service accounts would grow to $1.6 billion, and Congress specifically added $7.4 million for stepped up criminal investigations of money laundering related to drug traffic. 
18/wsj_1800:The $196.7 million provided for fiscal 1990 anticipates the purchase of a Lockheed P-3 surveillance aircraft and five Cessna Citation II jets.
18/wsj_1800:Despite administration reservations, the plan has had the quiet backing of customs officials as well as influential lawmakers from Cessna's home state, Kansas. 
18/wsj_1800:Among legislative provisions attached to the bill is a ban on any Treasury Department expenditure for enforcement of a 1986 tax provision intended to counter discrimination in employee-benefit plans.
18/wsj_1800:Repeal is considered likely now, but the Treasury Department bill has been used as a vehicle to raise the profile of the issue and block any action in the interim. 
18/wsj_1800:Less noticed is a bit of legislative legerdemain by Houston Republicans on behalf of HEI Corp. of Texas to retroactively "move" a Missouri hospital from one county to the next to justify higher Medicare reimbursements.
18/wsj_1800:The provision seeks to wipe out an estimated $1.4 million in claims made by the Health Care Finance Administration against HEI, which owned the hospital in Sullivan, Mo., during most of the four-year period -- 1983-1987 -- covered in the amendment. 
18/wsj_1800:A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill, but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. 
18/wsj_1800:The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox, entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use, but as a master of pork-barrel politics, he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a Tennessee center near Memphis and the northern Mississippi border. 
18/wsj_1801:Michael F. Klatman, director of corporate public relations at Data General Corp., was named to the new position of vice president, corporate communications, of this maker of data storage equipment. 
18/wsj_1802:B.A.T Industries PLC may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan -- including the sale of its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field units -- in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets, company officials said. 
18/wsj_1802:If anything, the gyrations in world stock markets -- and in B.A.T's share price -- since last Friday's sharp Wall Street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring, analysts and several big institutional holders said. "Thank God we have some deal on the table," said Stewart Gilchrist, a director at Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, which intends to vote its roughly 1% stake in favor of the restructuring. 
18/wsj_1802:Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10% of its shares and a 50% dividend increase. 
18/wsj_1802:But B.A.T's restructuring, which was never going to happen quickly, now will take longer because of the market upheaval.
18/wsj_1802:Company officials, holders and analysts who previously expected the disposals to be substantially complete by the end of next year's first half now say the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second half. "We aren't forced sellers.
18/wsj_1802:"The last few days will surely slow down the pace of events," says Scottish Amicable's Mr. Gilchrist. "But I wouldn't write off" Sir James or other potential bidders. 
18/wsj_1802:Among possible delays, the sales of Saks and Marshall Field -- which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial Christmas season -- may slide into the second quarter or second half.
18/wsj_1802:Analysts estimate that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly $2 billion. 
18/wsj_1802:B.A.T isn't predicting a postponement because the units "are quality businesses and we are encouraged by the breadth of inquiries," said Mr. Prideaux.
18/wsj_1802:Other potential bidders for parts of B.A.T's U.S. retail unit include Dillard Department Stores Inc., May Department Stores Co. and Limited Inc. B.A.T has declined to identify the potential bidders. 
18/wsj_1802:His initial offer indicated he needed to raise as much as 80% of the takeover financing through the debt markets. 
18/wsj_1802:Finally, Tuesday's California earthquake initially knocked 3.7% off B.A.T's share price in London yesterday because of fears of the potential claims to Los Angeles-based Farmers, which has a substantial portion of its property and casualty exposure in California. 
18/wsj_1802:On Farmers, Mr. Prideaux said it is too early to quantify the level of potential claims.
18/wsj_1802:He added B.A.T "has no expectation of a material impact on Farmers." 
18/wsj_1803:Air traffic at San Francisco International Airport was running about 50% of normal yesterday afternoon, but airport officals said they expect a return to full operations by Saturday.
18/wsj_1803:The major gateway to Asia and one of the nation's 10 busiest airports was closed to all but emergency traffic from the time the quake hit Tuesday afternoon, until 6 a.m. PDT yesterday when controllers returned to the tower. 
18/wsj_1803:Tom Schumacher, executive vice president and general manager of the California Trucking Association in Sacremento, said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the Bay area yesterday, except for emergency-medical supplies. "Some foodstuff shipments will probably resume Thursday," he said. "Right now most of the roads into the Bay area are closed, but the list of closings changes about every 20 minutes.
18/wsj_1803:United Parcel Service, Greenwich, Conn., said its operations in the San Francisco area have been reduced to 40% of normal.
18/wsj_1803:A UPS spokesman said that although none of the company's terminals, trucks or airplanes were damaged in the quake, road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages.
18/wsj_1803:Southern Pacific Transportation Co., the hardest hit of the three railroads in the Bay area, said service on its north-south coastline, which is used by an Amtrak train between Los Angeles and Seattle, was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake.
18/wsj_1803:Rail-transit operations suffered little damage, according to Albert Engelken, deputy executive director of the American Public Transit Association in Washington.
18/wsj_1803:The Bay Area Rapid Transit "withstood the earthquake perfectly," said Mr. Engelken, adding that the rail system was running a full fleet of 45 trains during the day to provide an alternative for highway travelers. "The highway system is screwed up" by the earthquake, Mr. Engelken said. "The transit system is how people are going to be getting around." He added that San Francisco's trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels. 
18/wsj_1803:The earthquake shattered windows at San Francisco International's air-traffic control tower and rained pieces of the ceiling down on controllers, three of whom suffered minor injuries.
18/wsj_1803:United Airlines, the largest carrier at San Francisco, was operating only 50% of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal, which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area.
18/wsj_1803:A United spokesman said 14 of its 21 gates were unusable, mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors. 
18/wsj_1803:The United spokesman said none of its people were injured at the airport; in fact, as the airport was being evacuated Tuesday night, two babies were born. 
18/wsj_1803:In terms of diversions, Denver's Stapleton International may have experienced the most far-flung: A United flight from Japan was rerouted there. "I think that's the first nonstop commercial passenger flight from Japan to land here," an airport spokesman said. 
18/wsj_1803:A Japan Air Lines spokesman said its flights into and out of San Francisco weren't affected, but getting information about its operations was difficult.
18/wsj_1804:Whitbread already has been approached by "about half a dozen" companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business, a spokesman said.
18/wsj_1804:Seagram's gin is the world's No. 2 gin brand, but the company doesn't own any of the major gin brands imported in the U.S. Allied-Lyons, while powerful in whiskey, doesn't own any major white-spirit brands. "We will certainly have to take a look at" the Whitbread spirits business, an Allied-Lyons spokesman said. "We would certainly like to have a major white-spirits brand in our portfolio." A Seagram spokesman in New York wouldn't comment. 
18/wsj_1804:Smaller liquor companies, such as Brown-Forman Corp. and American Brands Inc. of the U.S., also are likely to be interested.
18/wsj_1804:Whitbread's wine, spirits and soft-drink operations had trading profit of #35.4 million on sales of #315.5 million in the year ended Feb. 25.
18/wsj_1804:The company, which is retaining most of its wine and all of its soft-drink interests, didn't break out results for the businesses it plans to sell.
18/wsj_1804:Whitbread had total pretax profit in the year ended Feb. 25 of #223.2 million, on sales of #2.26 billion. 
18/wsj_1804:British brewers currently own thousands of pubs, which in turn sell only the breweries' beer and soft drinks.
18/wsj_1804:Under new rules, many of the country's pubs would become "free houses," selling beers of their choice. 
18/wsj_1804:Whitbread now intends to bolster its brewing interests, in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses.
18/wsj_1804:The company, which last month paid #50.7 million for regional British brewer Boddington Group PLC, has about 13% of the British beer market.
18/wsj_1804:In Britain, those interests include the Beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with PepsiCo Inc. of the country's Pizza Hut chain.
18/wsj_1804:In Canada and the U.S., Whitbread owns The Keg chain of steak and seafood restaurants. 
18/wsj_1804:The spirits business "would require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players." 
18/wsj_1804:At that time Sam Whitbread, the company's chairman and a descendant of its 18th-century founder, will retire from executive duties.
18/wsj_1804:He will retain the honorary title of non-executive chairman. 
18/wsj_1805:The Treasury plans to raise $700 million in new cash with the sale Tuesday of about $10 billion in two-year notes to redeem $9.29 billion in maturing notes. 
18/wsj_1806:The real estate limited partnership also said it will pay a special year-end cash distribution of 10 cents a unit.
18/wsj_1806:Both distributions are payable Dec. 4 to limited partners of record Nov. 3. 
18/wsj_1807:Mellon Bank Corp. said directors authorized the buy-back of as many as 250,000 common shares. 
18/wsj_1809:Digital Equipment Corp. is planning a big coming-out party on Tuesday for its first line of mainframe computers.
18/wsj_1809:On the morning of the long-planned announcement, International Business Machines Corp. is to introduce its own new mainframe. "Their attitude is, `You want to talk mainframes, we'll talk mainframes, '" says one computer industry executive. 
18/wsj_1809:That doesn't scare Digital, which has grown to be the world's second-largest computer maker by poaching customers of IBM's mid-range machines.
18/wsj_1809:IBM appears more worried about Digital, which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line, dubbed the VAX 9000. "It's going to be nuclear war," says Thomas Willmott, a consultant with Aberdeen Group Inc. 
18/wsj_1809:Robert M. Glorioso, Digital's vice president for high performance systems, says Digital's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything revolves, but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations, personal computers, printers and other devices.
18/wsj_1809:That's about half the price of comparably equipped IBM mainframes.
18/wsj_1809:And IBM isn't expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until 1991. 
18/wsj_1809:IBM has a near-monopoly on mainframes, with an estimated 70% share of the market.
18/wsj_1809:IBM is five times the size of Digital -- and 40 times the size of Tandem -- and wields enormous market power.
18/wsj_1809:It counts among its customers a majority of the world's largest corporations, which entrust their most critical business information to IBM computers. 
18/wsj_1809:A key marketing target for Digital will be the large number of big customers who already own both Digital and IBM systems.
18/wsj_1809:Bankers Trust uses Digital's VAX to run its huge money-transfer and capital markets accounts, juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day, he says.
18/wsj_1809:He bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds of Digital's largest customers. 
18/wsj_1809:Although Digital will announce a full family of mainframes next week, it isn't expected to begin shipping in volume until next year.
18/wsj_1809:The first model available will be the 210, which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the optional super-charger, or vector processor, says Terry Shannon of International Data Corp., a market research concern. 
18/wsj_1809:The company has long struggled to deliver a strong mainframe-class product, and made a costly decision in 1988 to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end.
18/wsj_1809:Amdahl Corp., backed by Japan's Fujitsu Ltd., has a growing share of the market with its low-priced, IBM-compatible machines.
18/wsj_1809:And National Advanced Systems, a joint venture of Japan's Hitachi Ltd. and General Motors Corp. 's Electronic Data Systems, is expected to unveil a line of powerful IBM-compatible mainframes later this year. 
18/wsj_1810:Prices of long-term Treasury bonds hovered in a narrow band most of the day, finishing little changed despite the dollar's weakness and fears about a wave of government borrowing coming soon. 
18/wsj_1811:James L. Madson, 46 years old, was named a vice president and assistant general manager of this producer of copper and other minerals.
18/wsj_1812:AMR Corp. posted an 8.8% drop in third-quarter net income and said the fourth quarter will be "disappointing" as well, primarily because of slimmer profit margins and increased fuel costs. 
18/wsj_1812:AMR's earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of American Airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records.
18/wsj_1812:Some analysts say the latest results only seem pale by comparison with a spectacular second half of 1988. 
18/wsj_1812:Still, AMR's stumble doesn't bode well for the rest of the industry.
18/wsj_1812:The Fort Worth, Texas, company is generally regarded as one of the best-run in the business, and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days. 
18/wsj_1812:Costs are giving them a little bit of trouble, and the whole industry is having a pricing problem." 
18/wsj_1812:AMR's board, in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday, said: "Ill-considered and reckless acquisition proposals adversely affect employee, financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of AMR shareholders. . . . AMR has not been, and is not, for sale." 
18/wsj_1812:Mr. Crandall said the company's current decline in earnings is exactly the kind of situation that an excessively leveraged company laden with debt from a takeover would find difficult to weather. 
18/wsj_1812:"Our very disappointing third-quarter results and the discouraging outlook for the fourth quarter underscore the importance of an adequate capital base," he said. 
18/wsj_1813:Christopher Whittington, 51-year-old deputy chairman of this British investment-banking group and chairman of Morgan Grenfell & Co., the group's main banking unit, has retired from his executive duties.
18/wsj_1813:Succeeding Mr. Whittington as deputy chairman of the group is Anthony Richmond-Watson, 43, currently a main board member.
18/wsj_1814:Without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses, the economic and structural damage by Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina would have been much less, as highlighted by your Oct. 3 editorial "Subsidizing Disaster." 
18/wsj_1814:Congress should stop throwing tax dollars out to sea by subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands, such as the hard-hit Isle of Palms near Charleston. 
18/wsj_1814:As you mentioned, subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the Coastal Barrier Resource System.
18/wsj_1814:The National Taxpayers Union would like Congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting "The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989." 
18/wsj_1814:However, home builders would have to bear the full costs of such beach-house construction. 
18/wsj_1815:The government said 13.1% of Americans, or 31.9 million people, were living in poverty in 1988. 
18/wsj_1815:The bureau's report also showed that while some measures of the nation's economic well-being improved modestly in 1988, the fruits of prosperity were shared less equitably than the year before. 
18/wsj_1815:Summarizing data derived from a March 1989 survey of 58,000 households, William Butz, associate director of the Census Bureau, said that "most groups either stayed the same or improved." But, he added, "Since the late 1960s, the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal.
18/wsj_1815:There was no reversal {of that trend} between 1987 and 1988." 
18/wsj_1815:Per capita income, a widely used measure of a nation's economic health, hit a record in 1988, rising 1.7% after inflation adjustment to $13,120.
18/wsj_1815:But the median income of American families fell 0.2%, the first time it has failed to rise since 1982. 
18/wsj_1815:Mr. Butz said the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure, including the rising number of female-headed families and a sharp increase in income reported by Americans who aren't living in families. 
18/wsj_1815:As a result of last year's decline, the government's estimate for the number of people living below the poverty line declined by about 500,000.
18/wsj_1815:The poverty threshold, defined as three times food expenses as calculated by the Agricultural Department, last year was $12,092 for a family of four.
18/wsj_1815:Thanks largely to the continued growth of the U.S. economy, the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the 1983 peak of 15.3%, but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years. 
18/wsj_1815:In 1988, 31.6% of blacks lived in poverty, compared with 10.1% for whites and 26.8% for Hispanics.
18/wsj_1815:But two-thirds of all poor Americans were white.
18/wsj_1815:More than half of poor families were headed by women living without men, the bureau said.
18/wsj_1815:More than three-fourths of poor black families were headed by women. 
18/wsj_1815:The poverty rate of children under 18 years old dropped last year to 19.7% from 20.5% in 1987, but remained far higher than a decade ago.
18/wsj_1815:-- Some 17.2% of all money income received by families in 1988 went to the wealthiest 5% of all families, up from 16.9% in 1987.
18/wsj_1815:-- The top fifth of all families got 44% of the income, up from 41.5% a decade earlier.
18/wsj_1815:The bottom fifth of all families got 4.6% of the income, down from 5.2% a decade earlier. 
18/wsj_1815:-- Confirming other government data showing that wages aren't keeping pace with inflation, earnings of year-round, full-time male workers fell 1.3% in 1988 after adjusting for higher prices, the first such drop since 1982.
18/wsj_1815:Earnings of female workers were unchanged. 
18/wsj_1815:-- Per capita income of blacks, though still only 60% that of whites, rose 3.9% in 1988, while per capita income of whites rose only 1.5%. 
18/wsj_1815:-- Among married couples, the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply, as income of black families shot up 6.8% while income of whites didn't budge. 
18/wsj_1815:The bureau said some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988 -- and the poverty rate would have been 10.5% instead of 13.1% -- under the alternative calculation. 
18/wsj_1815:Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years.
18/wsj_1815:A report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress released yesterday concluded, "It is misleading to make this change without adjusting for other changes." 
18/wsj_1815:The official poverty threshold is set by the Office of Management and Budget. 
18/wsj_1817:The space shuttle Atlantis boosted the Galileo spacecraft on its way to Jupiter, giving a big lift as well to an ambitious U.S. program of space exploration. 
18/wsj_1817:Seven years late in the launching, $1 billion over budget and a target of anti-nuclear protestors, Galileo has long been a symbol of trouble for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
18/wsj_1817:But yesterday, as Atlantis rumbled into a patch of clear sky above Florida with storm clouds closing in on it, NASA sought to turn Galileo into a symbol of triumph. 
18/wsj_1817:Jupiter is so enormous -- its mass is 318 times that of Earth -- that its gravity may have trapped these primordial gases and never let them escape. 
18/wsj_1817:Investigating Jupiter in detail may provide clues to what astronomer Tobias Owen calls the "cosmic paradox" of life: Jupiter and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that are essential for life on Earth, but these planets are lifeless; Earth, on the other hand, has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life.
18/wsj_1817:Some scientists have suggested that comets and asteroids may have brought enough of this kind of material from the outer solar system to Earth to spawn life. 
18/wsj_1817:Beginning in December 1995, Galileo will begin a two-year tour of the Jovian moons.
18/wsj_1817:In 1979, two Voyager spacecraft sent back stunning photos of Jovian moons Io and Europa that showed them to be among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system.
18/wsj_1817:The photos showed active geysers on Io spewing sulfurous material 190 miles into its atmosphere and indicated that Europa may have an ocean hidden under a thick sheet of ice. 
18/wsj_1817:Galileo's photos of Europa will be more than 1,000 times as sharp as Voyager's, according to Torrence Johnson, Galileo's project scientist, and may show whether it actually has the only known ocean other than those on Earth. 
18/wsj_1817:Atlantis lifted Galileo from the launch pad at 12:54 p.m. EDT and released the craft from its cargo bay about six hours later. "Galileo is on its way to another world in the hands of the best flight controllers in this world," Atlantis Commander Donald Williams said. "Fly safely." 
18/wsj_1817:The Galileo project started in 1977, and a number of project veterans were on hand to watch the launch.
18/wsj_1817:An ebullient Mr. Johnson, wearing a NASA baseball cap and carrying a camera and binoculars, called the launch "fantastic." Benny Chin, manager of the Galileo probe, compared it to watching a child leave home. "I'm happy and sad," he said. 
18/wsj_1817:Having argued that Galileo's plutonium power source could have released lethal doses of radiation if the shuttle exploded yesterday, they weren't quieted by yesterday's successful launch.
18/wsj_1817:Voyager 2 sent back spectacular photos of Neptune and its moon, Triton, this summer. 
18/wsj_1817:Next month, NASA plans to launch a satellite to study cosmic rays dating from the birth of the universe.
18/wsj_1817:In December, the shuttle Columbia will try to retrieve a satellite that's been in orbit for nearly five years measuring the deleterious effects of space on materials and instruments.
18/wsj_1817:Not all of NASA's space-science work will be so auspicious, though.
18/wsj_1817:NASA won't attempt a rescue; instead, it will try to predict whether any of the rubble will smash to the ground and where. 
18/wsj_1818:We recall that the mayor of Charleston complained bitterly about the federal bureaucracy's response to Hurricane Hugo.
18/wsj_1819:Bally Manufacturing Corp. and New York developer Donald Trump have agreed in principle to a $6.5 million settlement of shareholder litigation stemming from Bally's alleged greenmail payment to Mr. Trump. 
18/wsj_1819:In February 1987, Bally thwarted a possible hostile takeover bid from Mr. Trump by agreeing to buy 2.6 million of Mr. Trump's 3.1 million Bally shares for $83.7 million -- more than $18 million above market price.
18/wsj_1819:Lawyers for shareholders, Bally and Mr. Trump all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement, citing a request by a federal court magistrate not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed. 
18/wsj_1819:But some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said the $6.5 million payment will be shared by Bally and Mr. Trump, with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money. 
18/wsj_1819:Mr. Steinberg made a $59.7 million profit on the sale to Disney of his investment in the company in 1984. 
18/wsj_1819:But lawyers said Mr. Steinberg probably faced much more potential liability because, when he sued Disney during his takeover battle, he filed on behalf of all shareholders.
18/wsj_1819:When Mr. Trump sued Bally, he sued only on behalf of himself. 
18/wsj_1819:Mr. Trump and Bally also appeared to have some leverage in the case because in the state of Delaware, where Bally is incorporated, courts have held that greenmail is often protected by the business-judgment rule.
18/wsj_1819:That rule gives boards of directors wide latitude in deciding how to deal with dissident shareholders. 
18/wsj_1819:SENATE HEARS final arguments in impeachment trial of federal judge. 
18/wsj_1819:Yesterday, U.S. Judge Alcee Hastings faced his jury -- the full U.S. Senate -- and said, "I am not guilty of having committed any crime." 
18/wsj_1819:Seventeen articles of impeachment against the Florida judge, one of the few blacks on the U.S. bench, were approved by the House in August 1988.
18/wsj_1819:He is also accused of lying under oath and of leaking information obtained from a wiretap he supervised. 
18/wsj_1819:Judge Hastings, who was acquitted of similar charges by a federal jury in 1983, claims he is being victimized and that the impeachment proceedings against him constitute double jeopardy. 
18/wsj_1819:But Rep. John Bryant (D., Texas), the lead counsel for the House managers who conducted a lengthy inquiry into Judge Hastings' activities, said "a mountain of evidence points to his certain guilt." 
18/wsj_1819:However, Judge Hastings has said he will continue to fight and is contemplating an appeal of any impeachment to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
18/wsj_1819:In a case involving Avondale Industries Inc. and its insurer, Travelers Cos., the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say are central to dozens of pollution cases around the country. 
18/wsj_1819:They also have argued that government proceedings notifying a company of potential responsibility don't fit the legal definition of a lawsuit; thus, such governmental proceedings aren't covered by the policies, the insurers say. 
18/wsj_1819:"This decision will have a very considerable impact," said Kenneth Abraham, professor of environmental law and insurance law at the University of Virginia, because many commercial insurance policies are issued by companies based in New York. 
18/wsj_1819:William Greaney, an attorney for the Chemical Manufacturers Association, said that while other appeals courts have ruled differently on whether cleanup costs are damages, the influence of the appeals court in New York "will make insurers sit up and listen." He said the decision was the first in which a federal appeals court has ruled whether administrative government proceedings qualify as litigation. 
18/wsj_1819:That is the conclusion of a report released by the New York State Bar Association.
18/wsj_1819:The report was based on a telephone survey of 1,250 low-income households across the state, a mail survey of major legal-services programs and on-site interviews with individuals in the field. 
18/wsj_1819:"The report provides detailed documentation of the extent and nature of the problem and indicates how we may want to shape solutions," said Joseph Genova, chairman of the committee that oversaw the survey and a partner at the law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. 
18/wsj_1819:According to the study, slightly more than 34% of those surveyed reported having at least one housing problem every year for which they had no legal help.
18/wsj_1819:During the 15-month survey, 43% of all legal-services programs said that at some period they were unable to accept new clients unless they had an emergency. 
18/wsj_1819:PROSECUTOR TO JOIN Gibson Dunn: Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Mastro, who headed the government's racketeering case against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, will join Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in its New York office.
18/wsj_1819:In 1987 he became deputy chief of the civil division.
18/wsj_1819:FORMER APPLE COMPUTER Inc. general counsel John P. Karalis has joined the Phoenix, Ariz., law firm of Brown & Bain.
18/wsj_1820:At the end of the term of the convertible loan, Sears could still own half the building, and AEW could own the other half.
18/wsj_1820:The parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building, which will be emptied of 6,000 employees from Sears' merchandise group, which is moving elsewhere.
18/wsj_1820:The new manager will face the daunting task of leasing 1.8 million square feet in a relatively soft Chicago real estate market.
18/wsj_1820:Also, it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage AEW will be able to convert into equity. 
18/wsj_1820:Convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late.
18/wsj_1820:In a convertible mortgage, the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity, usually less than 50%, at the end of the loan term.
18/wsj_1820:During the term, the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow, a percentage of the building's appreciation or a fixed return.
18/wsj_1820:The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal. 
18/wsj_1820:Sears said it would put the 110-story tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its anti-takeover restructuring.
18/wsj_1820:But Japanese institutions shied away from bidding on the high-profile tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger anti-Japanese sentiment. 
18/wsj_1820:Sears then went back to AEW, the Boston pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring.
18/wsj_1820:AEW has $3.5 billion of real estate investments nationwide, according to a spokesman. 
18/wsj_1821:Tandy Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire two units of Datatronic AB of Stockholm for cash.
18/wsj_1821:During 1988, the Datatronic subsidiaries had combined sales in excess of $200 million. 
18/wsj_1821:Closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals, the company said. 
18/wsj_1822:Two rules in pending congressional legislation threaten to hinder leveraged buy-outs by raising the price tags of such deals by as much as 10%. 
18/wsj_1822:Wall Street is seething over the rules, which would curtail the tax deductibility of debt used in most LBOs.
18/wsj_1822:The provisions, in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the House and Senate, could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s, some tax experts and investment bankers argue.
18/wsj_1822:Wall Street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous Senate version of one of the provisions. 
18/wsj_1822:At issue is the deductibility of certain junk bonds that are used in most LBOs.
18/wsj_1822:Such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value, with interest accruing instead of being paid to the holder.
18/wsj_1822:The House version of the legislation would kill that deduction, and label any such debt as equity, which isn't deductible.
18/wsj_1822:"You see these in just about every LBO," said Robert Willens, senior vice president in charge of tax issues at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. "It becomes a source of cash" for the company making the LBO because it gets a deduction and doesn't have to repay the debt for several years. 
18/wsj_1822:Typically, Mr. Willens estimates, this type of debt makes up 15% to 20% of the financing for LBOs.
18/wsj_1822:These types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as RJR Nabisco Inc., Storer Communications Inc. and Kroger Co. 
18/wsj_1822:A second provision passed by the Senate and House would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from LBO debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years.
18/wsj_1822:For example, if a company posted a loss of $100 million from buy-out interest payments, the existing rule would allow the concern to be able to receive a refund from the tax it paid from 1986 through 1989, when it may have been a profitable public company. 
18/wsj_1822:An investment group led by Chicago's Pritzker family recently lowered a $3.35 billion bid for American Medical International, Beverly Hills, Calif., because of the threat of the legislation. 
18/wsj_1822:One possible solution for Wall Street is to increase the equity part of the transaction -- that is, give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments.
18/wsj_1822:That would force the buy-out firm and the target company's management to reduce their level of ownership. "The pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through," said Peter C. Canellos, tax partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. 
18/wsj_1822:The House version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes, has at least a five-year maturity and doesn't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five.
18/wsj_1822:The Senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield $17 million the first year and a total of $409 million over five years.
18/wsj_1823:The average publicly offered commodity fund fell 4.2% in September, largely because of the volatile markets in foreign currencies, according to Norwood Securities. 
18/wsj_1823:For the first nine months of the year, Norwood said the average fund has lost 3.3%. 
18/wsj_1824:The government moved aggressively to open the spigots of federal aid for victims of the California earthquake, but its reservoir of emergency funds must be replenished soon if the aid is to continue. 
18/wsj_1824:In addition, an unusually wide array of federal agencies moved to provide specialized assistance.
18/wsj_1824:The Department of Housing and Urban Development prepared to make as many as 100 vacant houses available for those left homeless, the Agriculture Department was set to divert food from the school-lunch program to earthquake victims, and the Pentagon was providing everything from radio communications to blood transfusions to military police for directing traffic. 
18/wsj_1824:But the pool of federal emergency-relief funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of cleaning up Hurricane Hugo, and Congress will be under pressure to allocate more money quickly.
18/wsj_1824:In Hugo's wake, Congress allocated $1.1 billion in relief funds, and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said $273 million of that money remains and could be diverted for quick expenditures related to the earthquake. 
18/wsj_1824:Now, though, enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief. "That obviously means that we won't have enough for all of the emergencies that are now facing us, and we will have to consider appropriate requests for follow-on funding," Mr. Fitzwater said.
18/wsj_1824:But Mr. Fitzwater said, "There will be, I think quite obviously, a very large amount of money required from all levels of government." 
18/wsj_1824:FEMA still has special disaster centers open to handle the aftermath of Hugo, and spokesman Russell Clanahan acknowledged that "we're pretty thin." Mr. Clanahan says FEMA now possibly may have the heaviest caseload in its history. 
18/wsj_1824:Twenty-five trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other states. 
18/wsj_1824:All the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to California won't be determined until state officials make specific requests to FEMA, agency officials said.
18/wsj_1824:The IRS said it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake's devastation.
18/wsj_1824:And the Treasury said residents of the San Francisco area will be able to cash in savings bonds even if they haven't held them for the minimum six-month period. 
18/wsj_1824:One advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the San Francisco Bay area, facilities that provide a ready base of supplies and workers.
18/wsj_1824:Even before the full extent of the devastation was known, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the Pentagon and prepare to respond to various FEMA requests for assistance. 
18/wsj_1824:And the Pentagon said dozens of additional crews and transport aircraft were on alert "awaiting orders to move emergency supplies." 
18/wsj_1824:Two Air Force facilities near Sacramento, and Travis Air Force Base, 50 miles northeast of San Francisco, were designated to serve as medical-airlift centers.
18/wsj_1824:To help residents in Northern California rebuild, FEMA intends to set up 17 disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with 400 to 500 workers from various agencies, said Robert Volland, chief of the agency's individual assistance division.
18/wsj_1824:The first phase of the program has been completed, but two other phases are continuing. 
18/wsj_1824:The two major structures that failed Tuesday night, he said, were both built well before the 1971 earthquake -- the San Francisco Bay Bridge, completed in the 1930s, and the section of I-880, built in the 1950s.
18/wsj_1824:The I-880 section had completed the first phase of the retrofitting. 
18/wsj_1825:But don't expect too much in the way of price breaks soon at the supermarket.
18/wsj_1825:Next year may see a drop of one percentage point. 
18/wsj_1825:Food companies probably won't cut their prices much, blaming other costs. "Labor takes the biggest single chunk out of the `food dollar, '" says Frank Pankyo of the Food Institute. 
18/wsj_1825:Stokely says stores revive specials like three cans of peas for 99 cents.
18/wsj_1825:Only about five states now offer some form of insurance coverage, but more are expected.
18/wsj_1825:A letter in the New England Journal of Medicine notes that while technology offers "almost endless hope . . . when to stop has become a difficult question. . . ." 
18/wsj_1825:The authors, from Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, say that 84% of the 50 births they followed occurred after only two in vitro cycles.
18/wsj_1825:Only three of the 25 corporate pension fund managers attending a Lowry Consulting Group client conference say they plan to change the asset allocation mix in their portfolios because of the market drop. 
18/wsj_1825:WORLD ODDITIES come alive in a multimedia version of the Guinness Book of Records.
18/wsj_1825:One of the artist's earliest Fax works was "Little Stanley Sleeping," a portrait of his dog. 
18/wsj_1825:Scott E. Thomas says the plans give employees "a bonus in the form of charitable donations made from an employer's treasury" in exchange for the political donation. "The U.S. government could be, in effect, subsidizing political contributions to corporate PACs," he says.
18/wsj_1825:An L.L. Bean spokeswoman notes: "People are just used to living in a last-minute society." Blunt Ellis, a Milwaukee brokerage firm, says part of the reason catalog sales grow in popularity is because consumers have more money but less time to spend it. 
18/wsj_1826:"People asked, is it really true?" says Maury Kelley, vice president, marketing services, for Beecham Products USA, a maker of health and personal-care products that used the ranking in its recruiting brochure. 
18/wsj_1826:The city's Office of Promotion plans media events to welcome its successor. 
18/wsj_1826:"I hate to dignify the publication by commenting on the obscene rating," Mayor Carolyn Robinson says, adding that cities have no way to rebut the book. "It's like fighting your way out of a fog.
18/wsj_1827:Northrop Corp. 's third-quarter net income fell 25% to $21.5 million, or 46 cents a share, while General Dynamics Corp. reported nearly flat earnings of $76.5 million, or $1.83 a share. 
18/wsj_1827:Northrop said sales fell because of the decline in B-2 development dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer F/A-18 fighter sections are being produced in its subcontract work with prime contractor McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
18/wsj_1827:Northrop, which since early 1988 has declined to accept fixed-price contracts for research and development, said earnings were hurt by excessive costs on a number of such contracts won years ago.
18/wsj_1827:The backlog of undelivered orders at Northrop on Sept. 30 was $4.68 billion, down from $5.16 billion a year earlier. 
18/wsj_1827:For the nine months, Northrop reported a net loss of $46.9 million, or $1 a share, compared with profit of $190.3 million, or $4.05 a share, in 1988.
18/wsj_1827:At General Dynamics, factors reducing earnings in the military aircraft segment included higher levels of cost-sharing in development of the Advanced Tactical Fighter, and the high cost of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter.
18/wsj_1828:Lotus Development Corp. reported a surprisingly strong 51% increase in third-quarter net income on a 32% sales gain, buoyed by strong demand for a new version of its 1-2-3 computer spreadsheet. 
18/wsj_1828:The results topped analysts' expectations and the earnings growth of competitors, prompting traders to all but forget the product-launch delays that bogged down the company for much of the past two years. 
18/wsj_1828:Yesterday, in heavy, national over-the-counter trading, Lotus shares rose to $32.50, up $1.25 apiece, capping a threemonth run-up of more than 40%. 
18/wsj_1828:Lotus said net rose to $23 million, or 54 cents a share, on sales of $153.9 million.
18/wsj_1828:A year ago, net was $14.3 million, or 31 cents a share, on sales of $116.8 million. 
18/wsj_1828:For the nine months, net of $38.5 million, or 92 cents a share, trailed the year earlier's $49.9 million, or $1.08 a share.
18/wsj_1828:In the first half, Lotus struggled to keep market share with costly promotions while customers awaited the launch of 1-2-3 Release 3, the upgraded spreadsheet software. 
18/wsj_1828:Lotus's results were about 10% higher than analysts' average expectations and compared favorably with the 36% earnings rise reported a day earlier by rival Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash.
18/wsj_1828:The company said results were bolstered by upgrades to Release 3 by previous customers and improved profit margins, the result of manufacturing-cost controls. 
18/wsj_1828:Rick Sherlund, a Goldman Sachs analyst, said Lotus had upgrade revenue of about $22 million in the quarter, twice what he had expected.
18/wsj_1828:Also, he estimated unit shipments of 1-2-3 in all its forms were about 315,000, up 7% from 1988's quarterly average. 
18/wsj_1828:He estimated that 1-2-3 outsold Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet by four-to-one in the quarter, and held a 70% or better share of the spreadsheet market. 
18/wsj_1829:Silicon Valley heaved a sigh of relief yesterday. 
18/wsj_1829:Though details were sketchy in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high-tech corridor along with the rest of the San Francisco Bay area, a spot check of computer makers turned up little, if any, potentially lingering damage to facilities or fabrication equipment. 
18/wsj_1829:Analysts and corporate officials said they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the Valley of either hardware or software goods.
18/wsj_1829:Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. were all up and running yesterday, though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways; others elected to take the day off. 
18/wsj_1829:"These systems are more rugged than many people would believe," said Thomas Kurlak, who tracks the computer industry for Merrill Lynch Research. "It's not the end of the world if you shake them up a little bit." 
18/wsj_1829:Other companies, including International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., completely idled their operations because of Tuesday evening's temblor, which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.
18/wsj_1829:IBM, for instance, said it anticipates returning to a normal work schedule by the weekend at its San Jose plant, which puts out disk drives for the 3090 family of mainframes.
18/wsj_1829:Apple Computer added that it was being "cautiously optimistic," despite not yet closely eyeballing all of its 50 buildings in the region.
18/wsj_1829:Even the carefully calibrated machinery in its giant Fremont plant, to the north of the Valley, was believed to be undamaged.
18/wsj_1829:Digital Equipment Corp., with major facilities in Santa Clara, Cupertino, Palo Alto and Mountain View, said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in Maynard, Mass., Tuesday night.
18/wsj_1829:For many companies, of course, there is still a slew of nagging problems to grapple with, some of which have the potential to become quite serious.
18/wsj_1829:But, given what might have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the microelectronics business, the bulk of Valley companies seemed to be just about shouting hosannas. 
18/wsj_1829:Several factors apparently spared the Valley -- a sprawling suburban stretch from San Jose to Palo Alto -- from the kind of impact felt in San Francisco, an hour's drive north.
18/wsj_1829:Also, the soil in the Valley is solid, unlike the landfill of San Francisco's downtown Marina District, which was hit with fires and vast destruction. 
18/wsj_1829:Intel said that over the past decade, it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves, sensitive to the shake of an earthquake, in the pipes that snake through its plants. 
18/wsj_1829:Like other large Valley companies, Intel also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation, so that a breakdown at one location shouldn't leave customers in a total pinch. 
18/wsj_1829:That's certainly good news for such companies as Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, which has only a four-day supply of microprocessors from the Valley on hand because of a just-in-time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory.
18/wsj_1829:Digital also said it has dispatched teams of technicians to California. 
18/wsj_1829:Meanwhile, several other major installations around the Valley -- America's center of high-tech -- said they, too, fared as well as could be expected.
18/wsj_1829:At Lockheed Corp. 's missiles and space systems group in Sunnyvale, about 40 miles south of San Francisco, workers were asked to head to work yesterday after it was realized that "there were no show-stoppers" in the 150-plus buildings on its one-square-mile campus. 
18/wsj_1829:Several engineering and research offices needed closer scrutiny to make sure they weren't in danger of crumbling, but "the bulk of the place is in pretty good shape," an official said. 
18/wsj_1829:One of Lockheed's most lucrative sectors -- accounting for more than half the aerospace company's $10.59 billion in sales in 1988 -- the missiles and space group is the prime Pentagon contractor on the Trident II ballistic missile.
18/wsj_1829:It also generates pieces of the missile shield called the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
18/wsj_1829:Fortunately, the Hubble Space Telescope -- set to be launched on the shuttle next year in a search for distant solar systems and light emitted 14 billion years ago from the farthest reaches of the universe -- was moved from Sunnyvale to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at the beginning of October. 
18/wsj_1830:They tried to put Mr. Maynard out of business by an act of Congress.
18/wsj_1830:Egg-industry lobbying helped persuade six states to ban Mr. Maynard's automatic egg-breaking machine because of fears over salmonella.
18/wsj_1830:Monthly sales of his Egg King machine -- which he now is marketing through a new company -- have sunk to about half a dozen from a peak of 75, says the 46-year-old businessman. 
18/wsj_1830:But his case is notable both for the scale of the fight -- it isn't often that a congressional hearing is held to determine whether one small businessman is a threat to the republic -- and for what it tells about the pitfalls of marketing a new product. 
18/wsj_1830:Part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry.
18/wsj_1830:Many larger egg producers are also egg processors, who crack, inspect, and sanitize billions of eggs, turning them into powdered, liquified or frozen egg products. 
18/wsj_1830:However, dozens of bakers, restaurant chefs and other food preparers who flocked to Mr. Maynard's defense say that products ranging from egg bread to eclairs lose some zip when the eggs come in 30-pound cans instead of shells.
18/wsj_1830:But for companies that use hundreds of eggs a day, breaking them by hand can get, well, out of hand. 
18/wsj_1830:Thus, any machine that breaks large amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread salmonella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones. 
18/wsj_1830:He says the handful of salmonella cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an Egg King stemmed from a failure to adequately cook the products.
18/wsj_1830:Opponents don't buy such arguments. "Human nature being what it is, people don't always follow instructions," says Jack Guzewich, chief of food protection for the New York state Health Department. 
18/wsj_1830:The Decatur, Ga., trade group has issued a "briefing book" that claims the machine is "a health hazard" and that Mr. Maynard is trying "to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation's egg producers." The UEP declines to comment, but the group's attorney, Alfred Frawley, says the group's actions are motivated solely by "health concerns." 
18/wsj_1830:An early battleground was the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
18/wsj_1830:Unfortunately for Mr. Maynard, another branch of the USDA, the Agricultural Marketing Service, was in charge of eggs.
18/wsj_1830:But the FDA in a 1985 letter to the United Egg Producers said that there was "little likelihood" of a health problem as long as instructions were followed. 
18/wsj_1830:Mr. Maynard's forces finally defeated the measure, though it took a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives to do it.
18/wsj_1830:But, so far, the change of scenery hasn't ended his string of bad breaks.
18/wsj_1831:But on the evidence of "The Fabulous Baker Boys," that may be the only thing she can't do, at least when she's acting in movies. 
18/wsj_1831:When she isn't performing for an audience, she prepares for a song by removing the wad of gum from her mouth, and indicates that she's finished by sticking the gum back in. 
18/wsj_1831:Steve Kloves, the young writer and director (he isn't yet 30), has only one produced picture to his credit; he wrote the screenplay for "Racing With the Moon," a lovely coming-of-age picture set in the '40s.
18/wsj_1831:Both movies are infused with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older, someone who doesn't dismiss dreams, but who also has enough experience to see his limits.
18/wsj_1831:Of course, it doesn't hurt that Mr. Kloves has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly what they're doing. 
18/wsj_1831:Much of the picture's sensuality emerges from cinematographer Michael Ballhaus's slyly seductive lens work.
18/wsj_1831:After working for years with Werner Rainer Fassbinder, the late German director, and more recently with Martin Scorsese ("After Hours," "The Color of Money," "The Last Temptation of Christ"), Mr. Ballhaus has developed a distinctively fluid style.
18/wsj_1831:And Dave Grusin's witty score embraces the banal requirements of banquet-hall musicianship ("Feelings" is a must) without condescension. 
18/wsj_1831:Anyone who's tried to appear "natural" in front of a camera knows that it's much more natural to end up looking like a stiff.
18/wsj_1831:Frank plans the program, takes care of business, and approaches the work like any other job.
18/wsj_1831:He's even able to think of a job that takes him out of the house 300 nights a week as an ordinary job.
18/wsj_1831:He's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs; the audience sees only the house, and only near the end of the movie.
18/wsj_1831:Ms. Tilly of the tweety-bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster's girlfriend on the television show, "Hill Street Blues." Here she delivers, especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the "Candy Man," which she sings while prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that couldn't be more perfect. (It matches her voice.) And Ms. Pfeiffer's particular version of "Making Whoopee" -- and the way Mr. Ballhaus photographs her, from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress -- might make you think of Marilyn Monroe if Ms. Pfeiffer hadn't gone and become a star in her own right. 
18/wsj_1831:VIDEO TIP: If you'd like to see the first time Michelle Pfeiffer sang on screen, and you have a lot of patience, take a look at "Grease 2." You'll find her there.
18/wsj_1831:Better yet, check out the emergence of her comic persona in "Married to the Mob," Jonathan Demme's delightful Mafia comedy. 
18/wsj_1832:International Proteins Corp. definitively agreed to pay $49 million and 2,850,000 of its shares for Hanson PLC's Ground Round restaurant subsidiary. 
18/wsj_1832:Shareholders of International Proteins, a food and agriproducts company, will vote on the transaction at a meeting late next month.
18/wsj_1832:Hanson is a London producer of consumer and other goods. 
18/wsj_1832:They closed Tuesday in composite trading at $13.625, down 37.5 cents, giving the stock portion of the transaction an indicated value of $38.8 million. 
18/wsj_1833:The tentative agreement calls for 3M to use the 115,000-square-foot plant and 19 acres of land for research laboratories.
18/wsj_1834:Raytheon Co. was issued a $19.2 million Air Force contract for support of the Milstar communications satellite. 
18/wsj_1835:Denis C. Smith was named to the new post of vice president of world-wide advanced materials operations for this chemicals concern.
18/wsj_1835:A. of Milan, Italy. 
18/wsj_1836:Galveston-Houston Co. said it will redeem all 3,950 shares of its privately held 6.5% convertible Series C preferred stock Nov. 8. 
18/wsj_1836:Holders can either convert each share into 421 shares of the company's common stock, or surrender their shares at the per-share price of $1,000, plus accumulated dividends of $6.71 a share. 
18/wsj_1837:Bank Building & Equipment Corp. of America, which previously said accounting discrepancies its auditors uncovered would hurt earnings and require restatement of earlier results, increased its projections of the negative fiscal impact, and said it was exploring the company's sale. 
18/wsj_1837:Bank Building, which builds and equips banks, had announced it would restate the first-three quarters of this fiscal year, which ends Oct. 31. 
18/wsj_1837:For the nine months ended July 31, Bank Building had a net loss of $1 million, on revenue of $66.5 million. 
18/wsj_1837:Bank Building, which expects to report a fourth-quarter loss, said it engaged advisers to "explore financial alternatives for the company including the possible sale of the company or one or more of its units." 
18/wsj_1838:Gen. Paul X. Kelley, retired commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, was elected a director of this plastics, specialty materials and aerospace concern, succeeding Jewel Lafontant, who resigned to accept a government position. 
18/wsj_1839:Rep. Mary Rose Oakar (D., Ohio) at last week's hearings on irregularities in programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development: 
18/wsj_1839:And one of our charges is to be an ombudsman for our area.
18/wsj_1839:And if we're not ombudsman for our area, we ought to be thrown out of office.
18/wsj_1840:The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it fined Capcom Futures Inc. $500,000 and accepted its withdrawal from membership as part of a settlement of disciplinary actions against the firm. 
18/wsj_1840:Capcom Futures is a Chicago subsidiary of Capcom Financial Services Ltd., a London financial firm that was implicated last year in a scheme to launder drug money.
18/wsj_1840:In June, the Chicago Board of Trade said it suspended Capcom Financial.
18/wsj_1840:The Capcom Futures unit withdrew from Board of Trade membership voluntarily in August, a Board of Trade spokesman said. 
18/wsj_1840:Capcom Futures, while neither admitting nor denying the Merc charges, said in a statement that the Merc charges were "technical in nature" and that "no customers were hurt" as a result of the violations cited by the Merc. 
18/wsj_1841:Frederick W. Lang, 65 years old, the founder of this software services concern, was elected to the new post of chairman.
18/wsj_1842:Maurice Warren, 56-year-old group managing director, was named chief executive officer of this food and agriculture group.
18/wsj_1842:The post of chief executive has been vacant since July when Terry Pryce, 55, left the company. 
18/wsj_1843:Money-market mutual fund assets grew at nearly three times their usual rate in the latest week, as investors opted for safety instead of the stock market. 
18/wsj_1843:"We were expecting it, following the fall of the Dow Friday," said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report. "It's the proverbial flight to safety." 
18/wsj_1843:Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that current yields continue for a year. 
18/wsj_1843:Most short-term certificates of deposit are yielding about 8% or less at major banks, and the yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction fell to 7.61% for three months and 7.82% for six months. 
18/wsj_1843:Money-fund assets have been rising at an average rate of $1.6 billion a week in recent months, Ms. Negus said, reflecting the relatively high yields.
18/wsj_1843:Some fund managers say inflows could increase in coming days as a result of stock selling in the wake of Friday's 190.58point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. "If you're selling equities, you don't start getting proceeds for five to seven days," said Frank Rachwalski, who manages the Kemper Money Market Fund. 
18/wsj_1843:Money-fund yields tend to lag interestrate trends as portfolio managers adjust the maturities of their investments -- short-term Treasury securities, commercial paper and the like -- to capture the highest yields.
18/wsj_1843:The average maturity of the funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's remained at 38 days for the third consecutive week.
18/wsj_1843:It was as short as 29 days at the start of this year, when rates were marching steadily upward, and hit 42 days in August. 
18/wsj_1843:The average seven-day simple yield of the funds fell to 8.21% this week from 8.26%.
18/wsj_1843:The highest yielding taxable fund this week was Harbor Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 12.75%.
18/wsj_1843:Among the other high-yielding funds, Fidelity's Spartan Fund had a seven-day compound yield of 9.33% in the latest week.
18/wsj_1843:The seven-day compound yield of the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Fund was 9.51%. 
18/wsj_1844:whose Della Femina McNamee WCRS agency created liar Joe Isuzu, among others -- announced a massive restructuring that largely removes it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to Paris-based Eurocom. 
18/wsj_1844:The complex restructuring, which was long expected, transforms London-based WCRS from primarily a creator of advertising into one of Europe's largest buyers of advertising time and space.
18/wsj_1844:The merged agency's admittedly ambitious goal: to become one of the world's 10 largest agencies, while attracting more multinational clients than the agencies were able to attract alone. 
18/wsj_1844:WCRS's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in Europe, where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk.
18/wsj_1844:For Eurocom, meanwhile, the move gives it a strong U.S. foothold in Della Femina, and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world-wide.
18/wsj_1844:According to terms, WCRS will pay 2.02 billion French francs ($318.6 million) for the 50% it doesn't already own of Carat Holding S.A., one of Europe's largest media buyers.
18/wsj_1844:Meanwhile, Eurocom, which had held 20% of WCRS's ad unit, will pay #43.5 million ($68.5 million) to raise its stake to 60%.
18/wsj_1844:That price also covers Eurocom raising to 60% its 51% stake in Europe's Belier Group, a joint venture ad agency network it owns with WCRS. Eurocom will also have the right to buy the remaining 40% of the merged ad agency group in six years. 
18/wsj_1844:The transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd., or EWDB.
18/wsj_1844:In an interview in New York, Mr. Breene, fresh from a Concorde flight from Paris where executives had worked through most of the night, outlined big plans for the new agency. "Our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a top-10 position . . . by the end of three years from now.
18/wsj_1844:He added that Eurocom and WCRS had agreed to provide a development fund of #100 million for acquisitions.
18/wsj_1844:Della Femina had billings of just $660 million last year and ranked as the U.S.'s 24th-largest ad agency.
18/wsj_1844:The merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than $2.6 billion -- most of that in Europe -- bringing it to about 14th world-wide.
18/wsj_1844:When WCRS created Della Femina McNamee out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988, it said it did so in order to attract larger clients, especially packaged-goods companies.
18/wsj_1844:But major packaged-goods players of the world -- such as Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever -- have steadfastly eluded the agency. "Three of our favorite names," Mr. Della Femina calls that roster, adding hopefully, "We're a much more attractive agency to large multinationals today than we were yesterday." 
18/wsj_1844:Still, the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media-buying firms that Europe has seen.
18/wsj_1844:As part of the restructuring, WCRS and Eurocom said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across Europe. 
18/wsj_1844:Carat will receive its WCRS stake as part of payment for the 50% Carat stake that WCRS is buying, while Eurocom said it expects to pay about #32 million for its WCRS stake. 
18/wsj_1844:Mr. Della Femina says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide agency, serving as a sort of "creative conscience." Louise McNamee, Della Femina's president, will continue running the U.S. agency day-to-day.
18/wsj_1844:WCRS Group, for its part, will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming "a holding company for a series of media-related businesses," said Peter Scott, the firm's chief executive.
18/wsj_1844:WCRS says its debt will be cut to #24 million from #66 million as a result of the transaction. 
18/wsj_1844:Carat's Gross brothers invented the idea of large-scale buying of media space.
18/wsj_1844:They thus have won the French space-buying business of such advertising giants as Coca-Cola Co., Fiat S.p.
18/wsj_1844:But now, other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media-buying groups -- and Carat wants to expand to the rest of Europe. 
18/wsj_1844:To help finance the Carat purchase, WCRS said it plans an issue of Euroconvertible preferred shares once the market settles down.
18/wsj_1844:But WCRS added that "in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets," it has arranged medium-term debt financing, which would be underwritten by Samuel Montagu & Co. Ltd. 
18/wsj_1844:While no agencies reported injuries to employees, the quake damaged the offices of J. Walter Thompson, Chiat/Day/Mojo and DDB Needham, among others, spokesmen for those agencies said.
18/wsj_1844:A number of agencies, including Thompson and Foote, Cone & Belding, said some employees who live outside of San Francisco, fearful that they wouldn't be able to get home, spent the night at the agency. 
18/wsj_1844:Thompson, a unit of WPP Group, will handle Faberge Organic shampoo and conditioner and Aqua Net hairspray.
18/wsj_1844:WHO'S NEWS: William Morrissey, 44, was named executive vice president, world-wide director of McCann Direct, the direct marketing unit of Interpublic Group's McCann-Erickson agency.
18/wsj_1844:He had been president and chief operating officer of Ogilvy & Mather Direct. 
18/wsj_1844:BOZELL: Los Angeles will be the site of a new entertainment division for the ad agency.
18/wsj_1844:The division will be headed by Dick Porter, who returns to Bozell after being vice president of media at MGM. 
18/wsj_1844:AC&R ADVERTISING: The agency's three California offices, previously called AC&R/CCL Advertising, will now be called AC&R Advertising to match the name of its New York office.
18/wsj_1844:AC&R Advertising is a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi Co. 
18/wsj_1845:Diamond-Star Motors Corp., a joint venture of Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said it will begin shipping Mitsubishi Eclipse cars to Japan next week, emulating other Japanese auto ventures shipping U.S.-built vehicles back to Japan. 
18/wsj_1846:One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention.
18/wsj_1846:The deportation of more than 315,000 men, women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years.
18/wsj_1846:Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry: that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century.
18/wsj_1846:On Tuesday it approved Senator Bob Dole's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24, 1990, as the "National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923," suffered at the hands of the warring Ottoman Empire. 
18/wsj_1846:It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey, a country that has been one of America's strongest allies in NATO.
18/wsj_1846:Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people?
18/wsj_1846:Mr. Dole's odd effort notwithstanding, most of Turkey's political problems lie with the Europeans.
18/wsj_1846:Part of the problem some Europeans have with Turkey seems to stem from its location -- Turkey isn't really part of Europe.
18/wsj_1846:Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people: Turkey, we are told, is not a Christian nation; its people simply won't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition.
18/wsj_1846:It's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire comes to the fore. 
18/wsj_1846:No one has to accept the sins of the Ottoman Empire to reject that argument.
18/wsj_1846:Kurds, suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of Syria, Iran and Iraq have inundated eastern Turkey.
18/wsj_1846:The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis cannot be ignored and shuttled off to that notorious dustbin of history that has become so convenient recently.
18/wsj_1846:Surely, the past suffering of any people at any time cannot be simply filed away and forgotten.
18/wsj_1846:Congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists.
18/wsj_1847:The single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods.
18/wsj_1847:But of course the Democrats pillorying HUD in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind.
18/wsj_1847:Instead, they're scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the HUD scandal. 
18/wsj_1847:This month, HUD Secretary Jack Kemp unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at HUD. No doubt many of his ideas are worthy, but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently.
18/wsj_1847:Last week, Secretary Kemp ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from House Banking Committee members.
18/wsj_1847:They were appalled, for instance, that he wanted to target more of the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious "discretionary" funds that have allowed HUD officials to steer contracts to political cronies. 
18/wsj_1847:Rep. Oakar, a Democrat from Cleveland, wants a $6.9 million grant so Cleveland can build an 18-story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
18/wsj_1847:Much of HUD's spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class.
18/wsj_1847:Even suburban Prince George's County, Md., reported last week there have been a record 96 killings there this year, most of them drug-related.
18/wsj_1847:A man in a wheelchair was gunned down in the crossfire of a Miami drug battle.
18/wsj_1848:Randy Delchamps was named chairman and chief executive officer of this grocery chain.
18/wsj_1848:Mr. Delchamps, 46 years old, succeeds A.F. Delchamps Jr., who died in a plane crash on Sunday at the age of 58.
18/wsj_1849:Natural upheavals, and most particularly earthquakes, are not only horrible realities in and of themselves, but also symbols through which the state of a society can be construed.
18/wsj_1849:The extent of the disaster stemmed from years of chicanery and bureaucratic indifference. 
18/wsj_1849:The larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of San Francisco is surely with the state of the U.S. economy.
18/wsj_1849:Did the stock-market tremors of Friday, Oct. 13, presage larger fragility, far greater upheavals?
18/wsj_1849:Are the engineering and architecture of the economy as vulnerable as the spans of the Bay Bridge? 
18/wsj_1849:The eerie complacency of the Reagan-Bush era has produced Panglossian paeans about the present perfection of U.S. economic and social arrangements.
18/wsj_1849:A licensed government intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, recently announced in The National Interest that history is, so to speak, at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of American civilization.
18/wsj_1849:But we are, in reality, witnessing the continuing decline of the political economy of capitalism: not so much the end of history but the history of the end. 
18/wsj_1849:The financial equivalent of the sand used by those Armenian contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy-outs associated with them.
18/wsj_1849:Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was -- in the early 1980s -- the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets, the famous Q ratio associated with Prof.
18/wsj_1849:In theory, the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same.
18/wsj_1849:But of course the market could decide that the firm's capital stock -- its assets -- means nothing if the firm is not producing profits.
18/wsj_1849:By 1982 the ratio was 43.5%, meaning that the market was valuing every dollar's worth of the average firm's assets at 43 cents. 
18/wsj_1849:From the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only 43 cents to buy a dollar's worth of a firm's capital stock, an alert entrepreneur won't look the other way.
18/wsj_1849:Result: a landscape littered with lemons, huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate America. 
18/wsj_1849:But there were enough promoters announcing the end of history (in this case suspension of normal laws of economic gravity) for society to continue shielding its eyes.
18/wsj_1849:Mainstream economists and commentators, craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing, swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs, claimed the end result would be a leaner, meaner corporate America, with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall.
18/wsj_1849:But this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found.
18/wsj_1849:The beneficiaries were those financiers whose icon was the topic figure of '80s capitalism, Michael Milken's $517 million salary in one year. 
18/wsj_1849:Left-stream economists I associate with -- fellows in the Union of Radical Political Economists, most particularly Robert Pollin of the economics faculty at the University of California at Riverside -- were not hypnotized in the manner of their pliant colleagues.
18/wsj_1849:The consequences of building empires with sand are showing up.
18/wsj_1849:In contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at 2% or 3%, a Harvard study published in April of this year (and discussed in a lead story in The Wall Street Journal for Sept. 18) found the default rate on these junk bonds is 34%. 
18/wsj_1849:What is the consequence of a high-interest burden, high default rates and continued low profitability?
18/wsj_1849:Corporations need liquidity, in the form of borrowed funds.
18/wsj_1849:Without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits, they look to the government, which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or bailouts.
18/wsj_1849:The consequence can be inflation, brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the deflationary shock of a sudden crash. 
18/wsj_1849:Attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort: an assault on wages.
18/wsj_1849:Mr. Fukuyama, peering through binoculars at the end of history, said in his essay that "the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the West . . . the egalitarianism of modern America represents the essential achievement of the classless society envisioned by Marx." 
18/wsj_1849:Mr. Fukuyama might want to consult some American workers on the subject of class and egalitarianism.
18/wsj_1849:From its peak in 1972 of $198.41, the average American weekly wage had fallen to $169.28 in 1987 -- both figures being expressed in 1977 dollars.
18/wsj_1849:In other words, after the glory boom of the Reagan years, wages had sunk from the post World War II peak by 16% as capitalists, helped by the government, turned down the screws or went offshore. 
18/wsj_1849:Governments have become sophisticated in handling moments of panic (a word the London Times forbade my father to use when he was reporting the Wall Street crash in 1929).
18/wsj_1849:Capitalism may now be engineered to withstand sudden shocks, but there are fault lines -- the crisis in profits, the assault on wages, the structural inequity of the system -- that make fools of those who claim that the future is here and that history is over. 
18/wsj_1850:They reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion yen ($140 million) in the venture, whose headquarters would be in France or West Germany. 
18/wsj_1850:The action follows Federal Express Corp. 's acquisition of Flying Tiger Line Inc. in August.
18/wsj_1850:After that, "it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly," said Cotton Daly, director of cargo services for New York consulting firm Simat, Helliesen & Eichner Inc. 
18/wsj_1850:Mr. Daly said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by Federal Express, United Parcel Service of America Inc. and other fast-growing air-freight companies.
18/wsj_1850:But he said JAL is talking to Lufthansa and Air France about some sort of cargo venture. "It is just one of a number of strategies JAL has embarked upon to come to terms with the situation in Europe after 1992," the deadline for ending trade barriers in the EC, he said. 
18/wsj_1850:A Lufthansa spokeswoman in Tokyo said the head of Lufthansa's cargo operations had been in Toyko last week for talks with JAL.
18/wsj_1850:"Nothing is defined or signed at this point," Mr. Daly said of the talks.
18/wsj_1850:According to figures from the International Air Transport Association, they carried a combined 1.8 million tons of freight last year.
18/wsj_1850:Both European airlines operate extensive fleets of Boeing 747 freighters and 747 Combis, aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck.
18/wsj_1850:JAL also has signaled it is looking for toeholds in Europe before the end of 1992.
18/wsj_1851:Federal Paper Board Co. said it completed the previously announced purchase of Imperial Cup Corp., a closely held maker of paper cups based in Kenton, Ohio.
18/wsj_1851:Imperial Cup has annual sales of approximately $75 million.
18/wsj_1852:The decision, which affects millions of dollars of trading positions, was made late yesterday because the Pacific exchange's options floor was shut down as a result of Tuesday's earthquake.
18/wsj_1852:SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the Pacific exchange, guaranteeing the liquidity of the market. 
18/wsj_1852:Trading was light on the Pacific Stock Exchange yesterday, with workers at the exchange's main floor in San Francisco struggling to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage. 
18/wsj_1852:The most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading.
18/wsj_1852:Workers could dial out, but they couldn't receive telephone calls. "It's a very uncertain situation right now," said Navin Vyas, administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange, which has daily volume of about 10 million shares. 
18/wsj_1852:Charles Daggs, chairman and chief executive officer of Sutro & Co., said traders came to work at 5 a.m. PDT -- many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions -- but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company's two main facilities there.
18/wsj_1852:Traders worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows, despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of incoming phone calls.
18/wsj_1852:Also, most of the telecommunications equipment was out.
18/wsj_1852:Volume is down out of San Francisco, but not out of the 11 outlying offices," Mr. Daggs added.
18/wsj_1852:The company dispatched as many as 200 people in the San Francisco area to do the work, though most of the rerouting was done by computer. 
18/wsj_1852:Service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown San Francisco, while just parts of Oakland and San Jose were knocked out.
18/wsj_1852:But Dale Irvine, director of the emergency center, said service was being restored to outlying San Francisco areas. 
18/wsj_1852:The firm also will permit its members and the public "to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the Pacific exchange" even if the exchange is closed, said Wayne Luthringshausen, chairman of Options Clearing. (Put options give holders the right, but not the obligation, to sell a financial instrument at a specified price, while call options give holders the right, but not the obligation, to buy a financial instrument at a specified price). 
18/wsj_1853:International Business Machines Corp. said its board approved the purchase of $1 billion of its common shares, a move that should help support its battered stock. 
18/wsj_1853:Even as the stock market has generally done well this year, IBM's shares have slipped steadily from its 52-week high of $130.875.
18/wsj_1853:Yesterday's closing price of $101.75, down 50 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, puts the stock at about 1 1/2 times book value, which is as low as it has sunk over the past decade. 
18/wsj_1853:The company has spent some $5 billion over the past 3 1/2 years to buy back 42 million common shares, or roughly 7% of those outstanding. 
18/wsj_1853:In addition, despite IBM's well-publicized recent problems, the computer giant still generates enormous amounts of cash.
18/wsj_1853:As of the end of the second quarter, it had $4.47 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand. 
18/wsj_1853:At yesterday's closing price, $1 billion would buy back about 10 million shares, or less than 2% of the roughly 580 million outstanding.
18/wsj_1853:In addition, as of Sept. 30, the company still had authorization to buy $368 million of stock under a prior repurchase program. 
18/wsj_1853:Then it had a series of smaller glitches, including problems manufacturing certain personal computers and the delay in the announcement of some important workstations.
18/wsj_1853:Finally, IBM had to delay the introduction of some high-end disk drives, which account for 10% of its $60 billion of annual revenue. 
18/wsj_1853:None of the problems is necessarily fatal, and they aren't all necessarily even related.
18/wsj_1853:The strong dollar, which reduces the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they are translated into dollars, is expected to knock 80 to 85 cents off IBM's per-share earnings for the full year.
18/wsj_1853:Without that problem, IBM might have matched last year's earnings of $5.81 billion, or $9.80 a share. 
18/wsj_1854:At the opening bell, investors quickly began singling out shares of companies expected to profit or suffer in some way from the California disaster, including insurers, construction-related companies, refiners and housing lenders.
18/wsj_1854:"Wall Street thinks of everything in terms of money," says Tom Gallagher, a senior Oppenheimer & Co. trader.
18/wsj_1854:The most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as General Re Corp., which rose $2.75 to $86.50, Nac Re Corp., up $2 to $37.75, American International Group Inc., up $3.25 to $102.625, and Cigna Corp., up 87.5 cents to $62.50.
18/wsj_1854:Before this bullish theory surfaced, some insurance stocks initially fell, indicating that investors thought the quake might cost insurers a lot of money.
18/wsj_1854:Meanwhile, shares of some big housing lenders got hit, on the likelihood that the lenders' collateral -- people's homes -- suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in value.
18/wsj_1854:One of its power generators was damaged, though the company said there won't be any financial impact. 
18/wsj_1855:Friday's stock market plunge claimed its second victim among the scores of futures and options trading firms here. 
18/wsj_1855:Petco Options, an options trading firm owned by the family of the deceased former Chicago Board of Trade chairman Ralph Peters, is getting out of the trade clearing, or processing and guaranteeing, business after sustaining a multimillion dollar loss Friday, options industry officials said. 
18/wsj_1855:Nearly 75 options traders on the Chicago Board Options Exchange who cleared trades through Petco, including a handful of traders who lost between $500,000 to $1 million themselves as a result of Friday's debacle, are trying to transfer their business to other clearing firms, CBOE members said. 
18/wsj_1855:Timothy Vincent, Petco chief executive officer, confirmed that Petco was withdrawing from the clearing business. "The owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business, and after Monday they felt they didn't want to be exposed any more," he said.
18/wsj_1855:Over the weekend Fossett Corp., another options trading firm, transferred the clearing accounts of about 160 traders to First Options of Chicago, a unit of Continental Bank Corp., because it couldn't meet regulatory capital requirements after Friday's market slide.
18/wsj_1855:The unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry's desire not to have its credibility tarnished by potentially widespread trading defaults on Monday.
18/wsj_1855:The CBOE, American Stock Exchange, Options Clearing Corp. and Stephen Fossett, owner of Fossett, joined in putting up $50 million to guarantee the accounts at First Options. 
18/wsj_1855:The head of another small options clearing firm, who asked not to be identified, said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business. 
18/wsj_1855:Prior to the introduction of financial futures in the late 1970s, most trading firms clustered around the LaSalle Street financial district here were family operations handed down from one generation to the next.
18/wsj_1855:Most also were relatively undercapitalized compared with the size of most Wall Street securities firms. 
18/wsj_1855:Mr. Peters, a LaSalle Street legend among the post-World War II generation of commodity traders, was rumored to have amassed a multimillion-dollar fortune from commodity trading and other activities by the time he died in May. 
18/wsj_1856:Part of a Series} 
18/wsj_1856:After she heard about the artery-clogging hazards of tropical oils in many cookies, she dropped Pepperidge Farm and started buying brands free of such oils. "I always thought Pepperidge Farm was tasty and high quality," Mrs. Lombardi says. "But I don't want any of that oil for my grandkids." (Pepperidge Farm says it can't tell exactly how many customers it has lost, but it hopes to remove the objectionable tropical oil from all its products by year end.) 
18/wsj_1856:She represents a new breed of savvy consumer who puts bargain prices, nutritional and environmental concerns, and other priorities ahead of old-fashioned brand loyalty. 
18/wsj_1856:Marketers themselves are partly to blame: They've increased spending for coupons and other short-term promotions at the expense of image-building advertising.
18/wsj_1856:What's more, a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands, many of which are virtually carbon copies of one other. 
18/wsj_1856:"Marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use" of promotions, contends Joe Plummer, an executive vice president at the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles ad agency. "Without some real product improvements, it's going to be difficult to win that loyalty back." 
18/wsj_1856:The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of Buying" survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products they use.
18/wsj_1856:For the survey, Peter D. Hart Research Associates asked some 2,000 consumers, including Mrs. Lombardi, whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty.
18/wsj_1856:More than half the users of 17 of the 25 products included in the survey said they're brand switchers. 
18/wsj_1856:Overall, 12% of consumers aren't brand loyal for any of the 25 product categories.
18/wsj_1856:About 47% are loyal for one to five of the products.
18/wsj_1856:Only 2% are brand loyal in 16 to 20 of the categories, and no one is loyal for more than 20 types of products. 
18/wsj_1856:Only for cigarettes, mayonnaise and toothpaste did more than 60% of users say they typically stick with the same brand. 
18/wsj_1856:He simply can't stomach the taste of Heinz, she says.
18/wsj_1856:Coke and Pepsi are all the same to me, and I usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale." 
18/wsj_1856:Only 23% of trash-bag users in the Journal survey usually buy the same brand, and just 29% of battery buyers stick to one brand. 
18/wsj_1856:Underwear scored a middling 36% in brand loyalty, but consumer researchers say that's actually quite high for such a mundane product. "In the past, you just wore Fruit of the Loom and didn't care," says Peter Kim, U.S. director of consumer behavior research for the J. Walter Thompson ad agency. "The high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women." 
18/wsj_1856:What loyalty there is to gas brands, he believes, is a matter of stopping at the most conveniently located service stations. 
18/wsj_1856:Nearly one-fourth of participants age 60 and older claim brand loyalty for more than 10 of the 25 products in the survey; only 9% of those age 18 to 29 have such strong allegiance. 
18/wsj_1856:An established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality, if not always the best value for the money.
18/wsj_1856:It's sort of loyalty by default. 
18/wsj_1856:Meanwhile, "the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal," says Laurel Cutler, vice chairman of the ad agency FCB/Leber Katz Partners. "They're buying whatever's cheaper." 
18/wsj_1856:Mr. Kim of J. Walter Thompson doesn't think so.
18/wsj_1856:Rather, they tend to have a set of two or three favorites.
18/wsj_1856:The BBDO Worldwide ad agency studied "brand parity" and found that consumers believe all brands are about the same in a number of categories, particularly credit cards, paper towels, dry soups and snack chips. 
18/wsj_1856:"When there's a clutter of brands, consumers simplify the complexity by telling themselves, 'All brands are the same so what difference does it make which I buy, '" says Karen Olshan, a senior vice president at BBDO. "Too often, advertising imagery hasn't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer." 
18/wsj_1856:A small but growing number of companies are also trying to instill more fervent brand loyalty through such personalized direct-marketing ploys as catalogs, magazines and membership clubs for brand users. 
18/wsj_1856:Some people argue that strong brands can afford to stop advertising for a time because of the residual impact of hundreds of millions of dollars spent on advertising through the years.
18/wsj_1856:Says Clayt Wilhite, president of the D'Arcy Masius ad agency's U.S. division, "Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement, brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like Budweiser." 
18/wsj_1856:"Now, Philip Morris {Kraft General Foods' parent company} is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House," says Dick Mayer, president of the General Foods USA division. "Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee, we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it." 
18/wsj_1856:Campbell Soup Co., for one, has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands. "The probability of converting a non-user to your brand is about three in 1,000," says Tony Adams, the company's vice president for marketing research. "The best odds are with your core franchise.
18/wsj_1856:Our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week, and we'd like to increase that." 
18/wsj_1857:Insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week's California earthquake. 
18/wsj_1857:Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month.
18/wsj_1857:But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake, coming so soon after the hurricane, will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers.
18/wsj_1857:Some adjusters, already in other parts of California, drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claims-processing centers. 
18/wsj_1857:State Farm, based in Bloomington, Ind., is also the largest writer of personal-property earthquake insurance in California. 
18/wsj_1857:Earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement "rider" on a homeowner's policy in California, because of the area's vulnerability to earthquakes.
18/wsj_1857:State Farm said about 25% of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance.
18/wsj_1857:Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., said about 23% of its personal property policyholders -- about 28% in the San Franciso area -- also have earthquake coverage. 
18/wsj_1857:The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated damage to residential property could total $500 million, but only $100 million to $150 million is insured, it said. 
18/wsj_1857:Officials from the American Insurance Association's property-claim service division, which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster, will be flying to San Francisco today.
18/wsj_1857:They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two. 
18/wsj_1857:Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage.
18/wsj_1857:Highways, such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland, generally don't have insurance coverage.
18/wsj_1857:Industry officials say the Bay Bridge -- unlike some bridges -- has no earthquake coverage, either, so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds. 
18/wsj_1857:However, the bridge, which charges a $1 toll each way, does have "loss of income" insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days.
18/wsj_1857:That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman's Fund Corp., based in Novato, Calif., and Cigna Corp., based in Philadelphia. 
18/wsj_1857:Instead, even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks, analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear. 
18/wsj_1857:Indeed, the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways.
18/wsj_1857:For example, insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy.
18/wsj_1857:"We are saying this is the breaking point, this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace," said William Yankus, an analyst with Conning & Co., a Hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry.
18/wsj_1857:Jack Byrne, chairman of Fireman's Fund, said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market, causing these rates to soar. 
18/wsj_1857:Orin Kramer, an insurance consultant in New York, estimates that the 1906 San Francisco destruction, on an inflation-adjusted basis, included insured losses of $5.8 billion.
18/wsj_1857:He is estimating this week's disaster will generate insured losses of $2 billion to $4 billion, following about $4 billion in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo. 
18/wsj_1858:The maker of computer workstations said a surge of government orders contributed to the increase.
18/wsj_1859:Hunter Environmental Services Inc. said it reached a preliminary accord on the sale of its environmental consulting and services business for about $40 million and assumption of related debt.
18/wsj_1859:The company said it also is making progress in negotiating the buy-out of its design division by management. 
18/wsj_1859:In addition, Hunter said it will use proceeds from a private placement of $8 million of preferred shares to purchase an interest in a start-up company to underwrite environmental impairment insurance. 
18/wsj_1860:Sir John has spurned Ford's advances since the U.S. auto giant launched a surprise bid for as much as 15% of Jaguar last month.
18/wsj_1860:The fiercely proud but financially strapped British company prefers to remain independent and publicly held, despite Ford's promise of access to cash and technological know-how. 
18/wsj_1860:GM's help would "make it possible {for Jaguar} to build a wider range of cars." An executive model would significantly boost Jaguar's yearly output of 50,000 cars. "You are talking about a couple hundred thousand a year," said Bob Barber, an auto-industry analyst at U.K. brokerage James Capel & Co. 
18/wsj_1860:The deal would require approval by a majority of Jaguar shareholders. "We have to make it attractive enough that {holders} would accept it," Sir John said. 
18/wsj_1860:That may be difficult, the Jaguar chairman acknowledged, "when you have somebody else breathing down your neck." Ford probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from U.S. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later, said Stephen Reitman, European auto analyst at London brokers UBS Phillips & Drew. 
18/wsj_1860:The anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15% of Jaguar shares without permission until Dec. 31, 1990. 
18/wsj_1860:But with its 10.4% stake, Ford can convene a special Jaguar shareholders' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely. "It's a very valuable weapon in their armory," which could enable Ford to bid sooner for Jaguar, observed Mr. Barber of James Capel. 
18/wsj_1861:BellSouth Corp. 's third-quarter earnings dropped 3.8% as a result of debt refinancing, the recent acquisition of a cellular and paging property and rate reductions in its Southeast territory. 
18/wsj_1861:Overall access minutes of use increased 10.3% and toll messages jumped 5.2%. 
18/wsj_1861:The refinancing of $481 million in long-term debt reduced net income by $22 million, or five cents a share, but in the long run will save more than $250 million in interest costs.
18/wsj_1861:The company previously said that the recent acquisition of Mobile Communications Corp. of America would dilute 1989 earnings by about 3%.
18/wsj_1861:Operating expenses increased 2.6% to $2.04 billion, including one-time pretax charges of $40 million for labor contract signing bonuses.
18/wsj_1861:a-reflects 2-for-1 stock split effective Dec. 30, 1988. b-reflects extraordinary loss of five cents a share for early debt retirement. c-reflects extraordinary loss of five cents a share and extraordinary gain of 14 cents a share from cumulative effect of accounting change. 
18/wsj_1862:The Wall Street Journal "American Way of Buying" Survey consists of two separate, door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization.
18/wsj_1862:Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data. 
18/wsj_1862:For each poll, the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the U.S. using the same questionnaire, the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1/2 percentage points in either direction.
18/wsj_1862:The margin of error for subgroups -- for example, married women with children at home -- would be larger.

18/wsj_1863:They accounted for a hefty 16% of New York Stock Exchange volume Monday, the fourth busiest session ever.
18/wsj_1863:On Friday, 13% of volume was in computer-guided program trades.
18/wsj_1863:In August, by contrast, program trading averaged 10.3% of daily Big Board turnover. 
18/wsj_1863:Program traders were publicly castigated following the 508-point crash Oct. 19, 1987, and a number of brokerage firms pulled back from using this strategy for a while.
18/wsj_1863:But as the outcry faded by the spring of 1988, they resumed.
18/wsj_1863:But the statistics released yesterday show the firms did nothing of the sort.
18/wsj_1863:Stock-index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it accelerates market moves, if not actually causing them.
18/wsj_1863:Under the exchange's definitions, program trading also describes a number of other strategies that, in the opinion of some traders, don't cause big swings in the market. 
18/wsj_1863:The Big Board's disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual.
18/wsj_1863:The Big Board declined to name the Wall Street firms involved in the activity Friday and Monday, or the type of strategies used.
18/wsj_1863:But traders on the exchange floor, who can observe the computer-guided trading activity on monitor screens, said most of the top program-trading firms were active both days. 
18/wsj_1863:Though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading, one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record.
18/wsj_1863:The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged a breathtaking 63.52 points in the first 40 minutes of trading Monday as stock-index arbitrage sell programs kicked in.
18/wsj_1863:By day's end, the Dow industrials had rebounded 88.12 points, or nearly half of Friday's drop. 
18/wsj_1864:FREDERICK'S OF HOLLYWOOD Inc., Los Angeles, said its board voted a 50% increase in the specialty boutique-store operator's semiannual dividend, to five cents a common share.
18/wsj_1864:The dividend is payable Dec. 15 to stock of record Nov. 15. 
18/wsj_1865:Valley National Corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of $72.2 million, or $3.65 a share, and suspended its quarterly dividend because of potential losses on its Arizona real estate holdings. 
18/wsj_1865:For the nine months, Valley National posted a net loss of $136.4 million, or $6.90 a share.
18/wsj_1865:It had profit of $48.6 million, or $2.46 a share, in the 1988 period.
18/wsj_1865:Valley National had been paying a quarterly dividend of 36 cents a share. 
18/wsj_1865:The decision to increase the loan-loss reserve and suspend the dividend is "both prudent and in the best long-term interest of the shareholders," he said. 
18/wsj_1865:Valley National said it made the decision on the basis of an "overall assessment of the marketplace" and the condition of its loan portfolio and after reviewing it with federal regulators.
18/wsj_1865:The addition to reserves comes on top of a provision of $199.7 million that was announced in June. 
18/wsj_1865:In July, Moody's downgraded $400 million of the company's debt, saying the bank holding company hadn't taken adequate write-offs against potential losses on real estate loans despite its second-quarter write-down.
18/wsj_1865:Bruce Hoyt, a banking analyst with Boettcher & Co., a Denver brokerage firm, said Valley National "isn't out of the woods yet." The key will be whether Arizona real estate turns around or at least stabilizes, he said. 
18/wsj_1866:Two years of coddling, down the drain. 
18/wsj_1866:That's the way a lot of brokers feel today on the second anniversary of the 1987 stock-market crash. 
18/wsj_1866:And until last Friday, it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off. "Some of those folks were coming back," says Leslie Quick Jr., chairman, of discount brokers Quick & Reilly Group Inc. "We had heard from people who hadn't been active" for a long time. 
18/wsj_1866:Then came the frightening 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a new wave of stock-market volatility.
18/wsj_1866:All of a sudden, it was back to square one. 
18/wsj_1866:"It's going to set things back for a period, because it reinforces the concern of volatility," says Jeffrey B. Lane, president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "I think it will shake confidence one more time, and a lot of this business is based on client confidence." 
18/wsj_1866:"The kinds of questions you had before have resurfaced," says Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman of regional brokerage firm Legg Mason Inc., Baltimore. "I can just tell the questions are right back where they were: `What's going on?,' `Can't anything be done about program trading?,' `Doesn't the exchange understand?,' `Where is the SEC on this? '" 
18/wsj_1866:But "these wide swings scare them to death." All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynch & Co. that have big "retail," or individual-investor, businesses.
18/wsj_1866:True, the amount of money investors are willing to entrust to their brokers has been growing lately.
18/wsj_1866:But those dollars have been going into such "safe" products as money market funds, which don't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms.
18/wsj_1866:At discount brokerage Charles Schwab & Co., such "cash-equivalent" investments recently accounted for a record $8 billion of the firm's $25 billion of client's assets. 
18/wsj_1866:The brokers' hope has been that they could soon coax investors into shifting some of their hoard into the stock market.
18/wsj_1866:A slightly higher percentage of New York Stock Exchange volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash 1988, according to Securities Industry Association data.
18/wsj_1866:In 1987, an average 19.7% of Big Board volume was retail business, with the monthly level never more than 21.4%.
18/wsj_1866:Jeffrey Schaefer, the SIA's research director, says that all of his group's retail-volume statistics could be overstated by as much as five percentage points because corporate buy-backs are sometimes inadvertently included in Big Board data.
18/wsj_1866:With the gyrations of recent days, says Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president at Charles Schwab, many small investors are absolutely convinced that "they shouldn't play in the stock market." 
18/wsj_1866:Joseph Grano, president of retail sales and marketing at PaineWebber Group Inc., still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market.
18/wsj_1866:Meanwhile, PaineWebber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving Wall Street their money. "It's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets, rather than push the investor to move into (specific) products such as equities," Mr. Grano says. "The equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there's a semblance of confidence." 
18/wsj_1866:Given enough of these, this will drive everyone out except the most hardy," he adds. 
18/wsj_1866:Mr. Ross, who has been studying retail investors' perception of risks in the brokerage industry, said a market plunge like Friday's "shatters investors' confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market." The long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is "miserable," Mr. Ross declares. 
18/wsj_1867:Washington, D.C. -- $200 million of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes, Series 1990, due Sept. 28, 1990.
18/wsj_1867:J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. is offering the remaining $10 million of notes.
18/wsj_1867:Federal National Mortgage Association -- $400 million of Remic mortgage securities being offered in 16 classes by Bear, Stearns & Co.

18/wsj_1867:Aegon N.V. (Netherlands) -- 250 million Dutch guilders of 7 3/4% bonds due Nov. 15, 1999, priced at 101 1/4 to yield 7.57% at issue price and 7.86% less full fees, via AMRO Bank.
18/wsj_1867:Continental Airlines -- a four-part, $71 million issue of secured equipment certificates priced through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
18/wsj_1867:The size of the issue was decreased from an originally planned $95.2 million.
18/wsj_1867:In addition, a planned two-part offering of $58 million in unsecured notes wasn't offered.
18/wsj_1867:The first part, consisting of $2.5 million of 11 1/4% secured equipment certificates due June 15, 1990, was priced at 98.481 with a yield to maturity of 13.75%.
18/wsj_1867:The second part, consisting of $28 million of 11 3/4% secured equipment certificates due June 15, 1995, was priced at 87.026 with a yield to maturity of 15.25%.
18/wsj_1867:The third part, consisting of $18.5 million of 12 1/8% secured equipment certificates due April 15, 1996, was priced at 85.60 with a yield to maturity of 15.75%.
18/wsj_1867:The fourth part, consisting of $22 million of 12 1/2% secured equipment certificates due April 15, 1999, was priced at 85.339 with a yield to maturity of 15.50%.
18/wsj_1867:All parts of the issue are callable at any time at par.
18/wsj_1867:Continental Airlines is a unit of Texas Air Corp. 
18/wsj_1868:John V. Holmes, an investment-newsletter publisher, and three venture-capital firms he organized were enjoined from violating the registration provisions of the securities laws governing investment companies. 
18/wsj_1868:As part of an agreement that settled charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a receiver was also appointed for the three venture-capital firms. 
18/wsj_1868:Mr. Holmes was the subject of a page one profile in The Wall Street Journal in 1984, after the SEC questioned him about ties between him and companies he touted in a newsletter.
18/wsj_1868:In 1986, in another consent agreement with the SEC, Mr. Holmes was enjoined from violating the stock-registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws.
18/wsj_1868:Without any admission or denial of guilt by Mr. Holmes, that agreement settled SEC charges that Mr. Holmes sold unregistered securities and misled investors. 
18/wsj_1868:In charges filed last week in federal district court in Charlotte, N.C., the SEC alleged that Venture Capitalists Inc., Venture Finance Corp. and New Ventures Fund Inc., all of Charlotte, failed repeatedly to file proper documents.
18/wsj_1868:The SEC also charged that Mr. Holmes acted as an officer or director of New Ventures, in violation of his previous consent agreement. 
18/wsj_1868:"Some companies were delinquent in filings and other actions, all of which cost money," Mr. Holmes said. 
18/wsj_1868:Two of Mr. Holmes's business associates who worked for Venture Capitalists, Kimberly Ann Smith and Frederick Byrum, also consented to being enjoined from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws.
18/wsj_1868:Ms. Smith also agreed to a permanent injunction barring her from acting as an officer, director or investment adviser of any mutual fund, unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company. 
18/wsj_1868:In consenting to the injunctions, none of the individuals or companies admitted or denied the allegations. 
18/wsj_1869:At the same time, a small group of Senate Democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon. 
18/wsj_1869:Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), the lead sponsor of the GOP proposal, said he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along, particularly this month's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit. 
18/wsj_1869:He gave 10-to-1 odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year, though it probably won't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill.
18/wsj_1869:For individuals, the Packwood plan would exclude from income 5% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year.
18/wsj_1869:The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35%.
18/wsj_1869:For corporations, the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33% from the current top rate of 34%.
18/wsj_1869:The Roth plan would create a new, non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement, but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses.
18/wsj_1869:For their part, the group of Democrats are working on a plan that, like the Packwood proposal, would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies.
18/wsj_1869:Separately, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee said he didn't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit.
18/wsj_1869:He also urged House and Senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit, including the House-passed capital-gains provision. 
18/wsj_1870:From a helicopter a thousand feet above Oakland after the second-deadliest earthquake in U.S. history, a scene of devastation emerges: a freeway crumbled into a concrete sandwich, hoses pumping water into once-fashionable apartments, abandoned autos. 
18/wsj_1870:But this quake wasn't the big one, the replay of 1906 that has been feared for so many years.
18/wsj_1870:Despite the tragic loss of more than 270 lives, and damage estimated in the billions, most businesses and their plants and offices in the Bay area weren't greatly affected. 
18/wsj_1870:The economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two, although some transportation problems may last weeks or months.
18/wsj_1870:A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake's epicenter -- 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland.
18/wsj_1870:The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance, so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows, falling brick and cornices, buckled asphalt or sidewalks. 
18/wsj_1870:Of course, the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation's capital of high technology.
18/wsj_1870:Like other major American cities, the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world's great natural harbors. 
18/wsj_1870:Michael L. Bandler, vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co., says nearly all the network's computer switches, which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another, changed to battery power when the city lost power.
18/wsj_1870:Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell's network, only four went down.
18/wsj_1870:One of those was in Hollister, Calif., near the earthquake's epicenter. 
18/wsj_1870:That's because the widely used fiber-optic cable has been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points.
18/wsj_1870:Nevertheless, phone service was sporadic; many computer terminals remained dark, and by late yesterday a third of San Francisco remained without power.
18/wsj_1870:Business in the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed; an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home. 
18/wsj_1870:The $125-billion-a-year Bay area economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation's most populous state and accounts for 2% to 3% of the nation's total output of goods and services, according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.
18/wsj_1870:In high-tech, the Bay area accounts for 15% to 20% of the U.S. computer-related industry. 
18/wsj_1870:"This has been a major disruption for the Bay area economy," says Pauline Sweezey, the chief economist at the California Department of Finance. "Obviously, things are going to have to go on hold for many companies." 
18/wsj_1870:A quarter of a million people cross the Bay Bridge every day, far more than the 100,000 that use the Bay Area Rapid Transit system (BART) -- which was working but wasn't stopping in the city's Financial District yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being checked for gas leaks. 
18/wsj_1870:California state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless don't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the Bay area.
18/wsj_1870:Of the scores of companies contacted by this newspaper, few reported any damage that they didn't expect to have remedied within a day or two.
18/wsj_1870:It is possible, of course, that some of the most seriously damaged companies couldn't be reached, particularly in areas nearest the epicenter. 
18/wsj_1870:Typical, perhaps, was the situation at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the General Motors Corp.-Toyota joint-venture auto plant in Fremont, about 35 miles south of Oakland.
18/wsj_1870:Ten of the plant's workers were injured when the quake hit about a half-hour into the afternoon shift; seven were hospitalized.
18/wsj_1870:But the plant was able to resume limited production of its Toyota Corollas and Geo Prizms by 6 a.m. yesterday, and absenteeism was only 7% of the work force, about twice normal. 
18/wsj_1870:Computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co., based in Palo Alto, says one of its buildings sustained severe damage when it was knocked off its foundation.
18/wsj_1870:Other buildings had broken glass, dangling light fixtures and broken pipes, a spokesperson says, estimating the cost of reconstruction "in the millions." 
18/wsj_1870:At the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Vice President Robert Fienberg says operations were "steaming along as usual" yesterday afternoon. 
18/wsj_1870:Most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from congestion.
18/wsj_1870:The telephone network simply couldn't handle the large number of people seeking to make a call at the same time.
18/wsj_1870:William E. Downing, Pacific Bell's vice president of customer services for the Bay area, says most long-distance companies were blocking about 50% of all calls.
18/wsj_1870:Pacific Telesis says its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50% of its calls locally. 
18/wsj_1870:Ironically, the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area's economic fortunes and, indeed, the nation's gross national product.
18/wsj_1870:"It would in the near-term give a boost to the San Francisco economy because there will be an influx of people to help," says Beth Burnham Mace, a regional economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm. 
18/wsj_1870:The construction industry is sure to feel increased demand. "There will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state, federal and local employment," Ms. Mace says.
18/wsj_1870:Wall Street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies.
18/wsj_1870:Shares of Lone Star Industries Inc., a cement maker, rose sharply in anticipation of stepped-up demand.
18/wsj_1870:In Greenwich, Conn., Lone Star spokesman Michael London says, "Obviously with an earthquake of this size, there are likely to be construction projects that wouldn't otherwise have been anticipated.
18/wsj_1870:But any increase isn't likely to be any kind of a surge.
18/wsj_1870:It's something likely to be spread out over a long period of time.
18/wsj_1870:There will be a lot of repair work that won't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new constructon would." Lone Star's San Francisco facilities weren't damaged in the quake. 
18/wsj_1870:The first effects are, of course, negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending.
18/wsj_1870:Many of the lost tourism dollars won't be recovered; many trips delayed never take place. 
18/wsj_1870:Because of the way the government keeps its books, the damage to the Bay Bridge, however costly, won't be counted as a minus.
18/wsj_1870:"It's very difficult to model the long-term impact of this," says Andrew Goldberg, who studies the public-policy and crisis-management aspects of earthquakes at the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington, D.C. "You certainly can say it's going to be extremely severe.
18/wsj_1870:We really are talking about shutting down a major American city for a number of days, maybe for a few weeks." 
18/wsj_1870:Mr. Goldberg says the cost of the earthquake will definitely top $1 billion and could reach $4 billion.
18/wsj_1870:The earthquake damage, of course, would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown San Francisco.
18/wsj_1870:A direct hit on a major city, Mr. Goldberg figures, would cause $20 billion to $40 billion of damage. 
18/wsj_1870:Experts caution that it is far too soon for reliable estimates of the quake's total damage, but it's clear that insurers are likely to pay out enormous sums. 
18/wsj_1870:Jack Byrne, the chairman of Fireman's Fund Corp., which is based in Novato, Calif., estimates insured losses resulting the earthquake could total $2 billion.
18/wsj_1870:The impact on the insurance industry "will be big and harsh, but less than {Hurricane} Hugo," says Mr. Byrne, who toured the Bay area by car yesterday afternoon to get a sense of the company's exposure to the earthquake. 
18/wsj_1870:Mr. Byrne says Fireman's Fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims, but, after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines, the company's fourthquarter charge against earnings shouldn't top $50 million.
18/wsj_1870:The company was able to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized maps of Northern California showing the exact locations of all the property it insures. 
18/wsj_1870:Fireman's Fund had claims adjusters on the streets of San Francisco right after sunrise yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot.
18/wsj_1870:In addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage, the insurer must cover worker-compensation claims and also losses due to businesses being shut down by lack of power or phone service. 
18/wsj_1870:The Independent Insurance Agents of America says fewer than one of every five California homeowners has earthquake insurance.
18/wsj_1870:A somewhat higher percentage of people living in the Bay area have bought the additional insurance protection, but the great majority aren't covered. 
18/wsj_1870:Whatever the long-term economic effect, the scene from the helicopter above Oakland is one of tragedy.
18/wsj_1870:Gargantuan sections of a double-decker freeway have been heaved about like plastic building blocks.
18/wsj_1870:In areas where the freeway made giant concrete sandwiches of itself lie cars that police say have been flattened into foot-thick slabs. 
18/wsj_1870:They peck away at the 1 1/2-mile section of rubble, searching for more of the 250 people thought to have died here.
18/wsj_1870:The heart of the earthquake, 6.9 on the Richter scale, was 50 miles to the south, near Santa Cruz, but its terrible fist struck here on the Nimitz Freeway, a major artery serving the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco.
18/wsj_1870:Along the way, the quake toppled a mall in Santa Cruz, knocked down buildings in San Francisco's fashionable Marina District and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city's Financial District. 
18/wsj_1870:Just a short span across the bay to the west, the quake also showed its mettle: A four-square-block area of the Marina District lies smoldering under a steady stream of seawater being pumped onto rubble to prevent it from blazing anew.
18/wsj_1870:Many of the buildings, mostly condominiums and apartments, were flattened almost instantly as the underlying soil -- much of it landfill -- was literally turned to ooze by the quake's intensive shaking, rupturing gas lines. 
18/wsj_1870:Onlookers say three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fireball shortly after the quake struck.
18/wsj_1870:From the air, ribbons of yellow fire hose carry water from the bay to high-pressure nozzles trained on the site.
18/wsj_1870:As onlookers stand behind barricades, helmeted firemen and building inspectors survey rows of nearby buildings that were twisted from their foundations and seem on the verge of collapse. 
18/wsj_1870:Evelyn Boccone, 85 years old, has lived in the district most of her life.
18/wsj_1871:PRINCE HENRI is the crown prince and hereditary grand duke of Luxembourg.
18/wsj_1871:An article in the World Business Report of Sept. 22 editions incorrectly referred to his father, Grand Duke Jean, as the crown prince. 
18/wsj_1872:Resolution Funding Corp. plans to sell $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday in the agency's first sale of securities. 
18/wsj_1872:Tenders for the bonds, available in minimum denominations of $1,000, must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Wednesday at Federal Reserve banks. 
18/wsj_1872:Of that amount, $20 billion has already been borrowed by the Treasury Department. 
18/wsj_1873:In addition, Searle will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores. 
18/wsj_1873:Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients. "We believe that every drug that's marketed to a consumer should have a consumer label," said Douglas Teich of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a Ralph Nader affiliate.
18/wsj_1873:According to federal officials and drug-industry studies, nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled each year aren't used properly, meaning that money is wasted on some prescriptions and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication. "We think it's very important to provide as much information as possible on the drugs consumers take," said Searle Chairman Sheldon Gilgore. 
18/wsj_1874:Bond prices rambled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply. 
18/wsj_1874:Early yesterday, bonds rose as investors rushed to buy Treasury securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive California earthquake.
18/wsj_1874:For example, some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies, which face massive damage claims, would get hit hard.
18/wsj_1874:With stocks not a major focus, "we're waiting for the next guiding light," said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities Inc. "If the stock market tremors are behind us, then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine" where interest rates are heading. 
18/wsj_1874:The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which jumped 3/8 point, or about $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount, during the first hour of trading, ended little changed.
18/wsj_1874:In the latest sign of how difficult it is to place certain junk bonds, Continental Airlines said it was forced to scale back the size of its latest offering. 
18/wsj_1874:Continental, a unit of Texas Air Corp., slashed the size of its note offering from $150 million to $71 million.
18/wsj_1874:In the multipart offering, the company sold a portion of secured notes but shelved all the unsecured notes. 
18/wsj_1874:A Continental spokeswoman said the notes may be offered at a later date. "This was not a do-or-die deal," she said. "I think this is a market that required some level of security.
18/wsj_1874:Investors have been speculating for weeks about the market's ability to place the $7 billion to $10 billion of new junk bonds scheduled to be sold by year end. 
18/wsj_1874:Supply troubles were also on the minds of Treasury investors yesterday, who worried about the flood of new government securities coming next week. 
18/wsj_1874:"We're being bombarded by new Treasury and agency debt offerings," said William Sullivan Jr., director of money-market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The market is concerned about its ability to underwrite all this debt at current levels." 
18/wsj_1874:In addition to the $15.6 billion of Treasury bills to be sold at next week's regular Monday auction, the government will sell $10 billion of new two-year Treasury notes.
18/wsj_1874:And Resolution Funding Corp. said late yesterday that it will sell $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds Wednesday.
18/wsj_1874:Refcorp is the financing unit of Resolution Trust Corp., a new government agency created to rescue the nation's troubled thrifts.
18/wsj_1874:In when-issued trading, the two-year Treasurys had a yield of about 7.88%. 
18/wsj_1874:In the municipal market, all eyes were on California debt as investors tried to gauge the financial ramifications of Tuesday's earthquake. 
18/wsj_1874:But traders said the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of California state and local municipal debt. 
18/wsj_1874:"There are certain bonds traders refer to as `earthquake' bonds because the (issuers) are on top of the San Andreas fault," said Zane Mann, editor of the California Municipal Bond Advisor, a newsletter for investors.
18/wsj_1874:But some bond market analysts said that could quickly change if property casualty insurance companies scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise cash to pay damage claims. 
18/wsj_1874:"Insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct San Francisco," said Charles Lieberman, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
18/wsj_1874:He also expects the performance of municipals to lag Treasurys as California is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities. 
18/wsj_1874:A report issued late yesterday by Standard & Poor's Corp. concluded the quake won't cause "wide-scale credit deterioration" for issuers and debt issues in the 12-county area of Northern California affected by the quake. 
18/wsj_1874:The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 100 29/32 to yield 8.03%, compared with 100 28/32 to yield 8.04% Tuesday.
18/wsj_1874:The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at a price of 99 26/32 to yield 8%, compared with 99 25/32 to yield 8.01%. 
18/wsj_1874:In the four-part offering, the $71 million of secured equipment certificates was priced to yield 13.75% to 15.75%. 
18/wsj_1874:Municipal bonds ended about 1/8 to 3/8 point lower, hurt by the circulation of two "bid-wanted" lists totaling $655 million. 
18/wsj_1874:Meanwhile, some California issues were down a touch more than the broad market, but traders said there hadn't been much investor selling because of the quake. 
18/wsj_1874:Traders said a steady stream of bonds was put up for sale yesterday, pushing yields for longer maturities up 0.05 percentage point.
18/wsj_1874:Traders said investors were reacting to recent negative news on the city's finances and are nervous ahead of the Nov. 7 election. 
18/wsj_1874:Washington, D.C., topped the competitive slate yesterday with a sale of $200 million of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes. 
18/wsj_1874:In late trading, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was off 1/4 point at 98 bid.
18/wsj_1874:The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage Association, two dominant issuers of mortgage securities, have a sizable amount of California home loans in their mortgagebacked pools. 
18/wsj_1874:Several key economic figures are due out and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson is scheduled to give the annual "Mansion House" address to the financial community. 
18/wsj_1875:East Germany yesterday removed Erich Honecker, one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world, in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens.
18/wsj_1875:But while it was a move that stunned the East bloc, it hardly ushers in an era of reform -- at least anytime soon. 
18/wsj_1875:For the Politburo replaced Mr. Honecker, who had led East Germany for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus, with a man cut of the same cloth: Egon Krenz, the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime Honecker protege.
18/wsj_1875:It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification -- a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow, Washington and Western Europe. 
18/wsj_1875:Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for "health reasons," West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday. (Mr.
18/wsj_1875:Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media.) 
18/wsj_1875:ADN said Mr. Honecker, a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall, also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military.
18/wsj_1875:Mr. Honecker's ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron-handed leadership during which Mr. Honecker, now 77 years old, built East Germany into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc.
18/wsj_1875:His grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his countrymen, dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule, fled to the West.
18/wsj_1875:Thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in East Germany's largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers' uprising in 1953. 
18/wsj_1875:In Washington, the Bush administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change.
18/wsj_1875:Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker." One top U.S. expert on East Germany added: "There is no clear-cut champion of reform, that we know of, in the East German leadership." 
18/wsj_1875:Indeed, Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups.
18/wsj_1875:The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party.
18/wsj_1875:Those allies included Politburo members Guenter Mittag, who has long headed economic affairs, and Joachim Hermann, chief of information policy.
18/wsj_1875:Both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday. 
18/wsj_1875:Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland, he was eight years old when World War II ended.
18/wsj_1875:In fact, the two men have had strikingly similar career paths, both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position. 
18/wsj_1875:Notably, one of Mr. Krenz's few official visits overseas came a few months ago, when he visited China after the massacre in Beijing.
18/wsj_1875:East German Protestantism in particular fears Mr. Krenz, in part because of an incident in January 1988 when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who had sought refuge in the Church. 
18/wsj_1875:Indeed, according to West German government sources, he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled Mr. Honecker.
18/wsj_1875:"He doesn't want to have the image of the gun man," says Fred Oldenburg, an expert at the Bonn-sponsored Institute of East European and International Studies in Cologne. "He's not a reformer -- he wants to have the image of a reformer." 
18/wsj_1875:As part of his image polishing, Mr. Krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party's authority.
18/wsj_1875:At the same time, the expectations of the East German people are great and will continue to grow.
18/wsj_1875:Says one West German official: "What's necessary now is the process of democratization.
18/wsj_1875:Chancellor Kohl, meanwhile, has invited Mr. Krenz to open discussions with Bonn on a wide range of subjects.
18/wsj_1875:The selection of Mr. Krenz may also disappoint Moscow.
18/wsj_1875:According to the Soviet news agency Tass, "Gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of {East} Germany, being sensitive to the demands of the time, . . . will find solutions to complicated problems the GDR {German Democratic Republic} encountered." 
18/wsj_1875:A force of younger pro-Gorbachev members in the East German bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country.
18/wsj_1875:The older generation has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they didn't. 
18/wsj_1875:From the perspective of East Germany's old guard, reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their country's reason for being.
18/wsj_1875:Unlike the other nations of the bloc, East Germany is a creature of the Cold War.
18/wsj_1875:Erasing the differences still dividing Europe, and the vast international reordering that implies, won't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary.
18/wsj_1875:But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map.
18/wsj_1875:Up to now, that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader Walter Ulbricht to establish the country's international legitimacy, followed by Mr. Honecker's campaign to build the East bloc's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise.
18/wsj_1875:Mr. Honecker spoke of "generally valid objective laws of socialism" and left no room for debate. 
18/wsj_1875:Politburo member Joachim Herrman confessed to a "grave concern" over Hungarian democracy. "Under the banner that proclaims the `renewal of socialism, '" he said, "forces are at work that are striving to eliminate socialism." 
18/wsj_1875:Some loyal voices, in and out of the East German Communist party, saw the nation's unrest coming.
18/wsj_1875:Some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy, at least in the workplace.
18/wsj_1875:Their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse East Germany of its Stalinist muck, not to merge with the West.
18/wsj_1875:One of their pastors has envisioned a "new utopia" of "creative socialism." 
18/wsj_1875:Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs, Mr. Honecker typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in Eastern Europe who took their cues from Moscow. 
18/wsj_1875:He was a "socialist warrior" who felt rankled by West Germany's enormous postwar prosperity and the Bonn government's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state.
18/wsj_1875:Finally, during his first and only state visit to Bonn two years ago, he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought.
18/wsj_1875:Mr. Honecker's removal "was bound to happen," says one aide to Chancellor Kohl. "It was only a matter of time." 
18/wsj_1875:The European Community Commission increased its forecast for economic growth in the EC in 1989 to 3.5%, slightly higher than its June projection of 3.25%. 
18/wsj_1875:At the other end of the spectrum, West German inflation was forecast at 3% in 1989 and 2.75% in 1990. 
18/wsj_1875:An official at Nestle Korea, a 50-50 joint venture between Nestle S.A. and the Doosan Group, said the new facility will manufacture all types of soluble, roasted and ground coffee, coffee mix and nondairy coffee creamer.
18/wsj_1875:The South Korean coffee market, consisting mostly of instant coffee, was estimated at about 100 billion won ($150.7 million) last year.
18/wsj_1875:Brands made by the Kraft General Foods unit of Philip Morris Cos. had about 95% of the market share.
18/wsj_1875:The agency said Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki told Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi of Poland's willingess to purchase the gas during Mr. Vaezi's current visit to Warsaw.
18/wsj_1875:Ke Zaishuo, head of China's delegation to a Chinese-British Liaison Committee on Hong Kong, accused Britain of trying to impose a fait accompli and said, "This is something we cannot accept." 
18/wsj_1875:El Al director Rafi Har-Lev and top officials of the Soviet Union's Aeroflot negotiated a preliminary pact in Moscow this week, the spokesman said.
18/wsj_1875:He added that concluding the deal requires approval by the governments of both countries, which have never had direct air links. 
18/wsj_1875:The chairman and a director of one of the Republic of Singapore's leading property companies, City Development Ltd., or CDL, were charged yesterday with criminal breach of trust of some 800,000 Singapore dollars (about US$409,000). 
18/wsj_1875:Kwek Hong Png, chairman of CDL, and director Quek Leng Chye were arrested by the republic's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau Tuesday night.
18/wsj_1875:In addition to abetting in the alleged criminal breach of trust, Kwek Hong Png was also charged with dishonestly receiving S$500,000 that had been stolen.
18/wsj_1875:Both men were charged in a subordinate court and released on bail of S$1 million. 
18/wsj_1875:The charges are the culmination of weeks of rumors concerning CDL that have depressed the company's share price and to a lesser extent the shares of all companies owned by CDL's controlling Quek family, brokers in Singapore say.
18/wsj_1875:News of the arrest and charging of the two men helped to push prices on the Singapore Stock market sharply lower in early trading yesterday, but brokers said that the market and CDL shares recovered once it became apparent the charges were limited to the two men personally. 
18/wsj_1875:One of the two British companies still making hard toilet paper stopped production of it.
18/wsj_1875:British Tissues decided to do away with its hard paper after a major customer, British Rail, switched to softer tissues for train bathrooms. . . . Peasants in Inner Mongolia have partly dismantled a 20-mile section of China's famed Great Wall, the official People's Daily said.
18/wsj_1876:Reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $1 million or more.

18/wsj_1877:A grand jury here indicted Norton Co. 's former director of advanced-ceramics research, charging him with interstate transportation of stolen property. 
18/wsj_1878:As the citizens of San Francisco and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from Tuesday's devastating earthquake, NBC News began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake's initial moments. 
18/wsj_1878:"In terms of coverage, it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes," said Eric Premner, president for broadcasting of King Broadcasting Co., which owns the NBC affiliate in Seattle, Wash. 
18/wsj_1878:While rival ABC News outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck -- the network was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park when the quake struck -- NBC News was unable to get its signal out of San Francisco for the first hour after the quake. 
18/wsj_1878:"I have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster," said Mr. Premner. "So before I start to be really critical of NBC, I would like to know more about what happened." 
18/wsj_1878:There were no complaints from affiliates of CBS Inc. and Cable News Network, a unit of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. 
18/wsj_1878:But that was not the case at NBC News, which has been dogged with the image of not being aggressive on major breaking stories.
18/wsj_1878:Last summer, the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student uprising in China. 
18/wsj_1878:"I was not pleased with the slow start, and neither was NBC News," said Guy Hempel, general manager of NBC affiliate WAVE in Louisville, Ky. 
18/wsj_1878:A spokesman for National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., said the network was "looking into what happened." The stations said they were pleased with the extended coverage yesterday, including a special five-hour edition of "Today." 
18/wsj_1878:Don Browne, director of news at NBC News, said in an interview that "we couldn't get a signal out of San Francisco.
18/wsj_1878:We were out of the box.
18/wsj_1878:The comment we're hearing is that we were slow out of the box, but beat everyone else in the stretch." 
18/wsj_1878:The quake postponed the third and fourth games of the World Series.
18/wsj_1878:In place of the games, ABC said it planned to broadcast next week's episodes of its prime-time Wednesday and Thursday lineups, except for a one-hour special on the earthquake at 10 p.m. last night.
18/wsj_1879:The announcement, made after the close of trading, caught analysts by surprise.
18/wsj_1879:Utility operations, the only company unit operating in the black in the latest period, had a 26% drop in profit, to $86.3 million, largely as a result of outages at the company's huge Palo Verde nuclear facility and the cost of purchased replacement power. 
18/wsj_1879:Losses at its Malapai Resources Co. uranium-mining unit narrowed to $3.4 million from $18 million a year ago, which included a $9 million write-down of utility inventories. 
18/wsj_1879:The latest quarter included a $6.6 million write-down of investments. 
18/wsj_1880:Equitec Financial Group said it will ask as many as 100,000 investors in 12 of its public real-estate limited partnerships to give approval to rolling them up into a new master limited partnership. 
18/wsj_1880:Shares of the new partnership would trade on an exchange like a stock. 
18/wsj_1880:Hallwood is a merchant bank whose activities include the ownership, management and financial restructuring of shopping centers, office buildings, apartments and other real estate. 
18/wsj_1880:While he didn't describe the partnerships' financial condition, he said their operations "continue to drain the resources of Equitec." 
18/wsj_1880:Equitec posted a $3.3 million net loss in the second quarter on $11.8 million of revenue, compared with a net loss of $12.9 million in the year-earlier period on revenue of $9.1 million. 
18/wsj_1880:Because of Tuesday's earthquake in Northern California, company officials couldn't immediately be reached for additional comment. 
18/wsj_1881:With airline deals in a tailspin, legendary Wall Street trader Michael Steinhardt could have trouble parachuting out of USAir Group, traders say. 
18/wsj_1881:Now, in the wake of UAL's troubles in financing its buy-out, the airline raiding game has been grounded.
18/wsj_1881:Instead of hoping to sell his USAir stake at analysts' estimated buy-out price of $80 a share, Mr. Steinhardt is stuck with roughly 3.7 million USAir shares that cost him $45, on average, but yesterday closed at 40 1/2, up 1/4, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
18/wsj_1881:At the current price, the USAir holding represents 9% of all the assets that Mr. Steinhardt manages.
18/wsj_1881:"If USAir is worth 80 as a takeover and the stock went to 52, the market was saying Steinhardt's presence wasn't worth anything, in terms of getting a deal done," says a veteran takeover speculator. 
18/wsj_1881:Mr. Steinhardt, who runs about $1.7 billion for Steinhardt Partners, made his name as a gunslinging trader, moving in and out of stocks with agility -- enriching himself and his investment clients.
18/wsj_1881:In recent days, traders say USAir has been buying its own shares, as part of a program to retire about eight million USAir shares, though the carrier won't discuss its buy-back program. 
18/wsj_1881:While USAir isn't considered absolutely takeover-proof, its defenses, including the sale in August of a 12% stake in the company to Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, are pretty strong. 
18/wsj_1881:USAir's deal with Mr. Buffett "wasn't exactly a shining example of shareholder democracy," Mr. Steinhardt says.
18/wsj_1881:Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company's managers, and to stir interest in the stock.
18/wsj_1881:But of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as Steinhardt Partners to take over a company. 
18/wsj_1881:By the second half of 1990, USAir stock could hit 60, says Helane Becker of Shearson Lehman Hutton.
18/wsj_1881:Mr. Steinhardt adds that he bought USAir stock earlier this year as "part of a fundamental investment in the airline group." 
18/wsj_1881:In 1989, Mr. Steinhardt says he made money trading in Texas Air, AMR and UAL. Overall, his investments so far this year are showing gains of about 20%, he adds. 
18/wsj_1882:Addington Resources Inc. said it called for redemption on Nov. 21 its $25.8 million outstanding of 8% convertible subordinated debentures due 2013. 
18/wsj_1882:The debentures were issued in the face amount of $46 million on July 11, 1988, the Ashland, Ky., coal mining, water transportation and construction company said.
18/wsj_1882:The company said the redemption is permitted because the price of Addington's stock has equaled or exceeded $19.60 for 20 consecutive trading days, a condition set in the terms of the debentures. 
18/wsj_1882:Debenture holders are expected to convert most of the debentures into common because the value of the stock received in a conversion would exceed the $1,103.11 redemption price. 
18/wsj_1883:Commodore International Ltd. said it will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 because sales of personal computers for the home market remained weak in some major countries. 
18/wsj_1883:Still, even results approaching break-even would mark a sharp weakening compared with fiscal 1989 first-quarter earnings of $9.6 million, or 30 cents a share, on sales of $200.2 million. 
18/wsj_1883:Commodore has said it expects sales to rebound, but market researchers have said that sales of the low-end products may finally be trailing off.

18/wsj_1884:Big Board volume dropped to 166,900,000 shares, in line with the level of trading over the past few weeks, from 224.1 million Tuesday.

18/wsj_1884:In addition, activity at a number of San Francisco-based brokerage houses was curtailed as a result of the earthquake, which knocked out power lines and telephone service throughout the Bay area. 
18/wsj_1884:Stocks retreated to session lows just after the opening amid worries about the market impact of the quake, but quickly snapped back to higher levels with the help of futures-related program buying.
18/wsj_1884:The early move essentially established the day's trading range, and traders said they saw little of the program activity that has battered the market recently. 
18/wsj_1884:I expected to see more volatility as some of the institutions who were spooked last Friday did some selling," said Raymond F. DeVoe, a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker, Baltimore. 
18/wsj_1884:Mr. DeVoe said he expects prices to show some renewed instability over the next few sessions as institutions re-evaluate their stance toward the market in light of its decline. "I would suspect that a lot of investment committees are looking into whether (they) want to be in stocks at all," he said. 
18/wsj_1884:Insurance stocks were sold at the opening amid concerns about the level of damage claims the companies would receive as a result of the earthquake.
18/wsj_1884:But those issues recovered quickly and turned higher because of expectations that the quake and the recent Hurricane Hugo would set the stage for an increase in premium rates. 
18/wsj_1884:Issues of insurance brokers were especially strong.
18/wsj_1884:Loews, the parent of CNA Financial, rose 1 3/8 to 123 1/8. 
18/wsj_1884:Companies in the construction, engineering and building-products sectors were among other beneficiaries of earthquake-related buying.
18/wsj_1884:Pacific Gas & Electric fell 3/8 to 19 5/8 in Big Board composite trading of 1.7 million shares and Pacific Telesis Group slipped 5/8 to 44 5/8 as the companies worked to restore service to areas affected by the quake. 
18/wsj_1884:None of the firms reported any major damage to facilities as a result of the quake. 
18/wsj_1884:UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, swung within a 14-point range during the course of the session before closing at 191 3/4, down 6 1/4, on 2.3 million shares. 
18/wsj_1884:British Airways, a member of the group that had offered $300 a share for UAL in a leveraged buy-out, said it had yet to receive a revised proposal and it was "in no way committed" to the completion of a bid.
18/wsj_1884:While UAL faltered, AMR, the parent of American Airlines, pulled out of its recent nosedive by rising 3/4 to 74.
18/wsj_1884:The stock had been on the decline since the financing for the UAL buy-out fell through on Friday and developer Donald Trump subsequently withdrew a takeover offer of $120 a share for AMR. Also, AMR was the most active Big Board issue; 2.8 million shares changed hands.

18/wsj_1885:For the nine months, net increased 4.4% to $2.08 billion, or $2.25 a share, from $2 billion, which included $273 million reflecting the effect of an accounting change. 
18/wsj_1886:Tartan currently produces gold at a cash operating cost of $393 an ounce, which is high by industry standards and $25 or so above the current spot price. 
18/wsj_1886:Granges said it also plans in the third quarter to write down the carrying value of the Tartan mine by 2.5 million Canadian dollars (US$ 2.12 million), and to write off most of the C$6.3 million carrying value of its Windflower gold property in British Columbia. 
18/wsj_1887:Computer Associates has carved out a huge business selling such software for use in managing networks of International Business Machines Corp. computers but needs to find new markets if it is to maintain its growth rate of 30% and more each year.
18/wsj_1888:Revenue fell 12.7% to $596.8 million from $684 million, although some of the decline was caused by discontinued operations.

18/wsj_1889:Dayton Hudson Corp. said it accepted for purchase seven million common shares at $62.875 each, under the terms of a Dutch auction self-tender offer.

18/wsj_1891:Enron Corp. said a subsidiary and two United Kingdom firms are studying the feasibility of constructing a 1,500 megawatt gas-fired power plant in northern England as an outgrowth of the government's privatization program. 
18/wsj_1891:Enron Power Corp., a unit of the Houston natural gas pipeline company, would design, construct and run the plant.
18/wsj_1891:A subsidiary of Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries would buy electricity and steam from the proposed station.
18/wsj_1891:Also participating in the study, Enron said, is the National Power division of Britain's Central Electricity Generating Board. 
18/wsj_1891:Upon privatization, National Power will be responsible for 70% of the country's power generating business. 
18/wsj_1892:Viacom Inc., New York, reported that its third-quarter loss widened to $21.7 million, or 41 cents a share, primarily because of interest expense of $70.1 million. 
18/wsj_1892:A year ago, Viacom had a net loss of $56.9 million, or $1.07 a share.
18/wsj_1892:In the year-ago quarter, Viacom also paid preferred stock dividends of $17 million; Viacom exchanged its preferred stock for debt in March. 
18/wsj_1893:Trinova Corp., Maumee, Ohio, said it is launching an extensive restructuring of its core business, and took a charge that resulted in a loss of $29.7 million, or 87 cents a share, for the third quarter. 
18/wsj_1893:Trinova said it will close, move or overhaul 40 of its 170 manufacturing facilities and over the next three years cut 1,500 jobs from its current world-wide payroll of 22,300 employees.
18/wsj_1893:Most of the factory closings and job cutbacks will affect Trinova's Aeroquip operations, which manufacture automotive plastics, hoses and other industrial and automotive parts.
18/wsj_1893:Hoses and plastics together account for about 42% of Trinova's total annual sales. 
18/wsj_1893:In a separate announcement, Trinova said the Aeroquip group has agreed to sell its spring-brake, piston-brake and related businesses to Midland Brake Inc. of Branford, Conn.
18/wsj_1893:To provide for the restructuring's costs, Trinova said it took an after-tax charge of $38.5 million, or $1.13 a share, in the third quarter.
18/wsj_1893:The $29.7 million net loss compares with net income of $19.6 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier.
18/wsj_1894:A group of investors, including Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe Communications Corp. and Sasea Holding S.A., have agreed to buy 76.66% of Odeon Finanziaria, a financially troubled Italian TV station. 
18/wsj_1894:Florio Fiorini, managing director of Geneva-based Sasea, said the investors would pay only a symbolic one lira for the station, "but we have agreed to raise the capital that will enable the company to continue operating.
18/wsj_1894:It's sort of a Chapter 11 situation," he added, referring to the U.S. bankruptcy law that protects companies from creditors while they restructure. 
18/wsj_1894:Milan-based Odeon, which draws about 3% of Italian TV viewers, has debt of 250 billion lire ($181.9 million), Mr. Fiorini said.
18/wsj_1894:He added that details of the recapitalization still have to be worked out, but that Pathe will take 50% of Odeon, Rome film producer Bruno Lucisano will take 10% and the remaining 16.66%, currently owned by Sasea, will eventually be sold to other investors.
18/wsj_1895:Kim Schwartz, a spokesperson for the American Red Cross in Los Angeles, said television and radio stations in San Francisco played a "very positive role" by providing the address of 28 shelters of the Red Cross and by giving out the Red Cross number for contributions to help earthquake victims (1-800-453-9000). 
18/wsj_1896:Sterling, which estimated the value of the contract at $150 million, said NASA selected another bidder for final negotiations. 
18/wsj_1896:As a result, last March the General Services Administration board of contract appeals directed NASA to reopen negotiations on the contract. 
18/wsj_1897:James A. Hagen, chairman and chief executive officer, noted that earnings advanced "in the face of a drop in business, brought on by the general economic slowdown." Revenue slipped 4.6% to $835 million from $876 million. 
18/wsj_1897:For the rest of 1989, Mr. Hagen said, Conrail's traffic and revenue "will reflect the sluggish economy, but Conrail will continue to take steps to control and reduce costs." 
18/wsj_1898:On a per-share basis, quarterly earnings remained at $1.85, the same as last year, because of the company's share buy-back program.
18/wsj_1898:Georgia Gulf had 24.9 million shares outstanding on average in the quarter, compared with 28.6 million in the third quarter of 1988, adjusted for a stock split paid in January 1989. 
18/wsj_1899:But a secondary agenda among officials in the City of Angels was to learn about the disaster-contingency plans that work and those that don't. 
18/wsj_1899:Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley used the opportunity to push the City Council harder to pass a measure establishing a loss-recovery reserve of $100 million.
18/wsj_1899:After San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos spoke on television of the need for building inspectors to check the soundness of buildings, Los Angeles dispatched 32 inspectors to help.
18/wsj_1899:And the county of Los Angeles placed its firefighters and sheriffs on alert, ready to send in reinforcements, and alerted San Francisco that the city has 1,000 hospital beds at its disposal. 
18/wsj_1899:Two Los Angeles radio stations initiated Red Cross donation campaigns, and one Los Angeles bank manager forked over $150,000 of his own money for relief purposes, the Red Cross said. 
18/wsj_1899:The Los Angeles Red Cross sent 2,480 cots, 500 blankets, and 300 pints of Type-O blood.
18/wsj_1899:It is also pulling 20 people out of Puerto Rico, who were helping Huricane Hugo victims, and sending them to San Francisco instead. 
19/wsj_1900:The ruling follows a host of problems at Tucson Electric, including major write-downs, a 60% slash in the common stock dividend and the departure of former Chairman Einar Greve during a company investigation of his stock sales. 
19/wsj_1900:A Tucson Electric spokesman said the utility was disappointed by the commission's decision and "concerned about the financial integrity of the company." 
19/wsj_1901:Seoul has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as one reason the won's value remains heavily controlled. 
19/wsj_1901:Mr. Roh said a U.S. demand for the removal of South Korean import quotas on beef will be resolved "satisfactorily" but gave no hint when that will happen.
19/wsj_1901:Speaking to a joint meeting of Congress earlier, he said South Korea can't move quickly on such agricultural trade issues "without causing political and social trauma." 
19/wsj_1902:Great American Bank said its board approved the formation of a holding company enabling the savings bank to pursue nontraditional banking activities under a new federal law. 
19/wsj_1903:Dale Lang, who this week completed the acquisition of the publisher of Ms. and Sassy, is candid about the challenge he is taking on. 
19/wsj_1903:Last Friday, he told the staff of Ms. that the magazine in January would begin publishing without advertising.
19/wsj_1903:Though Sassy has grown quickly since its debut in March 1988, it has been the target of conservative lobbyists and skittish advertisers who bristled at its frank editorial matter on teen-age problems. 
19/wsj_1903:Mr. Lang said the former Australian owners of Sassy were "blind-sided by the Moral Majority. . . . Their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out." He said Sassy will keep its irreverent tone, but added, "We will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the magazine." 
19/wsj_1903:I feel about Sassy like I did about Working Woman 10 years ago." Mr. Lang took on Ms. and Sassy with the acquisition of Matilda Publications Inc. by his newly formed Lang Communications.
19/wsj_1903:Lang owns 70% of Matilda, while Citicorp owns the rest through its Citicorp Venture Capital Partners.
19/wsj_1903:Industry observers have congratulated Mr. Lang on what some call his "courageous" handling of Ms., but his track record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews. 
19/wsj_1903:Success is expected to gain at least because of the recent folding of rival Venture, another magazine for growing companies. 
19/wsj_1903:Working Woman and Working Mother have operated as part of Working Woman/McCall's Group, a less-than-successful joint venture between Mr. Lang and Time Warner Inc.
19/wsj_1903:Executives at Time Inc. Magazine Co., a subsidiary of Time Warner, have said the joint venture with Mr. Lang wasn't a good one.
19/wsj_1903:Mr. Lang feels that Time's priorities changed. "Their management changed right after {the venture was formed}, and I don't think they were comfortable getting into the competitive wars of women's service magazines." 
19/wsj_1903:Today, Mr. Lang believes his magazines will offer what many women's magazines don't. "We write straight for women on their level," he said. "We don't have passive readers." Mr. Lang points out that even Success, in part, fits the company's image, since about 30% of its readership is female. 
19/wsj_1903:Mr. Lang has named Carol Taber, 43, as group publisher of New York-based Lang Communications.
19/wsj_1903:She will oversee Working Woman, Working Mother and Success magazines, and retain her post as publisher of Working Woman. 
19/wsj_1903:The sale price of McCall's -- twice what Mr. Lang originally paid for it -- will finance Lang Communications' buy-back of Time Warner's 50% interest in Working Woman and Working Mother.
19/wsj_1903:There is plenty of work to be done on what we have." 
19/wsj_1904:Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission Wednesday cleared Rhone-Poulenc S.A.'s purchase of a specialty bulk-chemical unit from Monsanto Co., saying the purchase was unlikely to have any lasting impact on U.K. industrial consumers. 
19/wsj_1904:The commission, which was asked to study the deal by the Department of Trade and Industry after its announcement in February, said the diversity of global supply of chemicals used in making analgesic drugs was great enough to offset the dominant U.K. market share Rhone-Poulenc would gain through the acquisition. 
19/wsj_1904:The French chemical giant would hold an 80% share of the U.K. market for salicylic acid, methyl salicylate and bulk aspirin. 
19/wsj_1905:Morrison Knudsen Corp. posted third-quarter net income of $7.9 million, or 69 cents a share, continuing a rebound from steep year-ago losses.

19/wsj_1905:Boise, Idaho-based Morrison had losses totaling $186 million over the two years ended in December, but it has surged back to profitability as a result of cost-cutting and shedding of unprofitable operations.

19/wsj_1906:Rep. Bates said he accepted the finding, but one of the victims, Dorena Bertussi, denounced the ethics panel's action as "absurd." 
19/wsj_1906:Acting more than a year after Ms. Bertussi filed a complaint, the panel issued a "letter of reproval" saying Rep. Bates had admitted conduct that violated a House rule forbidding discrimination against employees on account of their sex.
19/wsj_1906:It ordered Rep. Bates to write letters of apology to Ms. Bertussi and to a second complainant, Karen Dryden. 
19/wsj_1906:Rep. Bates said he would write the letters as ordered. "I accept the resolution of the matter by the Ethics Committee," he said. 
19/wsj_1906:Rep. Bates has publicly begged for forgiveness from voters and was re-elected with 60% of the vote last November. 
19/wsj_1907:Mesa Airlines said the takeover offer it received earlier this week from StatesWest Airlines is for a combination of cash and securities valued by StatesWest at $10 a Mesa share.
19/wsj_1907:Based on the number of Mesa shares outstanding not already owned by StatesWest, the proposed takeover would have a value of about $15.3 million.
19/wsj_1907:StatesWest owns 7.25% of Mesa. 
19/wsj_1909:Fleet reported nine-month net of $279.0 million, or $2.51 a primary share, up from $248.2 million, or $2.28 a share, a year earlier.

19/wsj_1910:The Portland, Ore., thrift, which has $5.2 billion of assets, had net income in last year's third quarter of $1.8 million, or 23 cents a share.
19/wsj_1910:The additional reserves relate to possible write-downs of certain assets held by Franklin and its subsidiaries and the default of a bond in its investment portfolio, the thrift said.
19/wsj_1911:Arkla Inc. said that as part of a program to improve profitability it will take a total of $189 million in after-tax charges by year end.
19/wsj_1911:It also announced an initial public offering of 18% of its gas exploration and production subsidiary. 
19/wsj_1911:Last year, the company had net income of $117.3 million, or $1.30 a share. 
19/wsj_1911:Arkla said it will report $179 milllion in one-time charges against continuing operations for the third quarter, reflecting settlement of certain natural gas contracts.
19/wsj_1911:It said it will take a $10 million fourth-quarter charge against discontinued operations, reflecting certain write-downs and the planned sale of a unit. 
19/wsj_1911:Arkla said its initial offering of 18% of Arkla Exploration Co. is expected to result in a net gain of about $90 million, which will be used to pay down Arkla debt.
19/wsj_1912:South Africa negotiated a new debt agreement with its major foreign creditors for about $8 billion of its foreign debt outstanding, said Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank and the country's chief debt negotiator. 
19/wsj_1912:The announcement coincides with the start of the Commonwealth Ministers Conference in Kuala Lumpur, where proposals for renewed sanctions against South Africa, including moves to block settling of a new debt agreement, were scheduled to be discussed. 
19/wsj_1912:The agreement calls for South African debtors to make repayments in eight installments, starting in December of next year.
19/wsj_1912:The redemption then would be at 1.5% of the total debt, increasing to 2.5% in February 1991, and to 3% at six-month intervals thereafter.
19/wsj_1912:A revised provision would be included for the conversion of short-term claims inside the net to long-term loans outside the net.
19/wsj_1912:Foreign debt falling outside the net of affected indebtedness -- which Mr. Stahl estimated at $12 billion -- would remain not subject to the debt arrangements. 
19/wsj_1913:New York Times Co. said net income rose in the third quarter because of a one-time gain on the sale of the company's cable-TV system. 
19/wsj_1913:The latest quarter included a gain of $193.3 million, or $2.46 a share, from the sale of New York Times Cable, completed in August. 
19/wsj_1913:Exclusive of the gain, operating profit declined 35% to $16.4 million, or 21 cents a share, from $25.2 million, or 31 cents a share.
19/wsj_1913:The decline primarily reflected the dilution from acquiring McCall's, Golf World (U.S.) and Sailing World magazines; lower equity earnings from the forest-products group because of price discounting and an unfavorable exchange rate, and an 8.7% decline in advertising linage at the New York Times, the company's flagship newspaper.
19/wsj_1914:Democrat Gene Taylor won a special election to fill the congressional seat vacated by the death of Republican Larkin Smith, taking back the GOP's lone redoubt in Mississippi's House delegation. 
19/wsj_1914:Mr. Taylor, a 36-year-old state senator from Bay St. Louis, won 65% of the vote in a district that has voted Republican in the past five presidential elections and that was once represented by Republican U.S. Sen. Trent Lott. 
19/wsj_1914:Even so, Mr. Taylor carried all but one of the district's dozen counties.
19/wsj_1915:The calls reached many, but certainly not all, of the publicly held companies with operations in the area.

19/wsj_1916:Could the collapse of I-880 have been prevented? 
19/wsj_1916:That was the question structural engineers and California transportation officials were asking themselves yesterday as rescue workers began the gruesome task of trying to extract as many as 250 victims from beneath the concrete slabs of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland that caved in during Tuesday's temblor. 
19/wsj_1916:The impact of the destruction of this 2.5-mile stretch of highway was tragically measured in lost lives.
19/wsj_1916:But there are other long-term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of California's infrastructure to withstand a major temblor. 
19/wsj_1916:It could easily be two years before the well-traveled artery that helps connect Oakland with San Francisco is reopened, and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $250 million, said Charles J. O'Connell, deputy district director in Los Angeles of the California Department of Transportation, nicknamed Caltrans.
19/wsj_1916:The aftershocks of the highway tragedy are reverberating in Los Angeles as well, as local politicians spoke yesterday against plans to bring double-decking to Los Angeles freeways by 1994.
19/wsj_1916:Caltrans plans to add a second deck for buses and car pools above the median of a 2.5-mile stretch of the Harbor Freeway just south of Los Angeles, near the Memorial Coliseum.
19/wsj_1916:Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn yesterday vowed to fight the introduction of double-decking in the area. 
19/wsj_1916:Caltrans abandoned double-decking in the early 1970s, following the 1971 Sylmar earthquake that destroyed freeway sections just north of Los Angeles, Mr. O'Connell explained.
19/wsj_1916:So why even consider stacking freeways now? "We've run out of places to build freeways in L.A., and the only place to go is up," Mr. O'Connell said, although he acknowledges there are many obstacles, including cost.
19/wsj_1916:But as for safety, he says double-deck freeways built today with the heavily reinforced concrete and thicker columns required after the Sylmar quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of 7.5 to 8 on the Richter scale. 
19/wsj_1916:Reasons for the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were sketchy yesterday.
19/wsj_1916:But most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks, and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable, or "liquefy," in a major quake. 
19/wsj_1916:The two-story roadway, designed in the mid-1940s and completed in 1957, was supported by columns that apparently lacked the kind of steel reinforcement used in highways today.
19/wsj_1916:While the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement, they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal "ties" that run horizontally through the column, said Leo Parker, a structural engineer in Los Angeles.
19/wsj_1916:Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes, with spiraling steel rods inside. 
19/wsj_1916:But in the case of the Nimitz Freeway, the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck, crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below. 
19/wsj_1916:Officials of the state agency didn't have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement didn't hold up. 
19/wsj_1916:Caltrans reinforced the highway in 1977 as part of a $55 million statewide project, using steel cables to tie the decks of the freeway to the columns and prevent the structure from swaying in a quake.
19/wsj_1916:The results of the quake certainly raise questions about whether reasonable care was taken, Mr. Messina says.
19/wsj_1916:Given the seismic history of the Bay Area, "it seems to me that a 6.9 earthquake is a foreseeable event." 
19/wsj_1916:Caltrans' Mr. Drago defended the agency's work on the Nimitz Freeway. "The work was done properly," he said. "Basically, we had a severe earthquake of significant duration and it was just something the structure couldn't withstand." 
19/wsj_1916:Ironically, Caltrans this year began working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state, this time wrapping freeway columns in "steel blankets" to reinforce them.
19/wsj_1916:But only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority, and the Nimitz Freeway, supported by double rows, was left out, Mr. Drago explained. "The reason is that the technology is such that we're not able to retrofit multi-column structures," he said. 
19/wsj_1917:Lionel Corp. 's board unanimously rejected a tender offer of $8 a share, or $95.4 million, for as much as 90% of Lionel by a group with a 9.9% stake in the toy retailer. 
19/wsj_1917:Lionel also urged holders of its stock and debt not to tender their securities, saying it wants to remain independent to pursue its business strategy.
19/wsj_1917:Lionel also said the offer by Robert I. Toussie Limited Partnership is inadequate, and full of conditions that leave it "subject to substantial uncertainty." 
19/wsj_1917:In addition, Lionel began a lawsuit in federal District Court in New York seeking to enjoin the offer, alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities law and fraudulent manipulation of the market for Lionel's securities. 
19/wsj_1917:Robert I. Toussie, general partner of the investment group, said the Lionel response reflected management's entrenched position, saying officials had failed to come up with a better alternative to his group's offer.
19/wsj_1918:As the strike enters its 15th day today, some members are getting nervous, the spokesman conceded, but the majority of the 55,000 Machinists are prepared to "wait it out as long as it takes." 
19/wsj_1919:United Merchants & Manufacturers Inc. said its president, Uzi Ruskin, withdrew his proposal to acquire control of the New York textile and clothing company. 
19/wsj_1919:Coupled with his current 1.2 million shares and 4% held by an associate, the stake would have given him control of 55% of the concern. 
19/wsj_1919:In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Ruskin had said that holders of the other 45% of United Merchants would receive one-half share of a new preferred stock for each of their shares. 
19/wsj_1919:A special committee of United Merchants directors said that in view of uncertainties regarding various legal and financial considerations, it couldn't recommend the plan to the full board. 
19/wsj_1919:The company is exploring, with a major financial institution, the development of a plan to boost the value of the company for its holders, Mr. Ruskin said. 
19/wsj_1919:In a separate SEC filing, Albert Safer, who holds 6.46% of United Merchants, said he retained investment bank Lazard Freres & Co. for advice as he evaluates the possibility of making a bid for the textile maker.
19/wsj_1920:The White House is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly. 
19/wsj_1920:In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning.
19/wsj_1920:Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims, but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a White House in action. 
19/wsj_1920:Mr. Bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast, and they clearly don't want a repeat of those charges now.
19/wsj_1920:So the White House announced that Mr. Bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff John Sununu. 
19/wsj_1920:By noon, Mr. Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle, who was in California; made a televised statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and visited FEMA headquarters. 
19/wsj_1920:The White House already is talking of Mr. Bush visiting the California earthquake site this weekend.
19/wsj_1922:The lethal shudders that wracked the San Francisco Bay Area -- rated a 6.9 on the Richter scale -- didn't match the great earthquake of 1906, rated at 8.25. 
19/wsj_1922:The difference of just 1.35 points on the scale, designed by Charles Richter of CalTech in the 1930s, means the older quake was "10 to 20 times stronger," says Lane Johnson, director of the University of California Berkeley Seismographic Station. 
19/wsj_1922:The ground ruptured along a 20-to-30-mile stretch of the San Andreas Fault on Tuesday, Mr. Johnson added.
19/wsj_1922:Though the epicenter of Tuesday's temblor was located 10 miles north of the town of Santa Cruz, and 50 miles south of San Francisco, its havoc hopscotched up the coast in seemingly random fashion.
19/wsj_1922:But the greatest damage was visited on buildings and roadways perched upon landfill, as were the Marina District of San Francisco and the Bay Bridge -- two areas of maximum devastation. 
19/wsj_1922:"Landfill -- loose and unconsolidated earth -- may feel like rock but it behaves like liquid when you shake it," said Douglas Segar, professor of geosciences at San Francisco State University in a televised interview. "It liquefies in a patchwork quilt pattern.
19/wsj_1922:Mr. Johnson, of the Berkeley seismographic station, said: "Landfill can be done if it's properly compacted.
19/wsj_1922:You can drive piles on it and build on it." He cited the example of San Francisco's financial district, where many new glass towers survived almost unscathed. 
19/wsj_1922:"The attention span of the public is short," he said. "We've known for years and years we've got lots of old {pre-1950s} unreinforced brick and masonry buildings." 
19/wsj_1922:One old building, the Golden State Bank Building on Front Street, had its yellow brick facade sheared off by the shock of the quake, leaving a wedge of its third floor open to the air, while piles of dusty bricks tumbled to the street below narrowly missing rush-hour pedestrians and cars.
19/wsj_1922:The urgency is heightened because this week's earthquake -- while major and followed by hundreds of aftershocks -- didn't release enough pent-up energy tension along the faultlines to preclude more and bigger quakes soon. 
19/wsj_1923:Coke said it will test market a caffeine-free version of its flagship brand, Coca-Cola Classic, beginning next week in Charlotte, N.C. Other, as yet unnamed, cities will follow.
19/wsj_1923:After the confusion surrounding the change of the Coke formula in 1985, Coca-Cola was reluctant to clutter the Classic name with a brand extension.
19/wsj_1923:"The name Classic Coke has tremendous value, and they haven't merchandised that name before," says Jesse Meyers, publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest. 
19/wsj_1923:The Coke spokesman said a caffeine-free Classic should help increase volume of the original brand.
19/wsj_1923:Indeed, analysts have said that the absence of new products, among other factors, has limited sales growth throughout the industry.
19/wsj_1923:Coke now leads Pepsi in market share in caffeine-free diet colas but trails Pepsi in sales of caffeine-free sugared colas, according to Beverage Digest. 
19/wsj_1923:Coke has been studying the possibility of introducing a caffeine-free Classic for a year, a company spokesman said.
19/wsj_1923:He said large increases in sales of other non-caffeine soft drinks make the timing right now. 
19/wsj_1924:CALIFORNIA STRUGGLED with the aftermath of a Bay area earthquake. 
19/wsj_1924:As aftershocks shook the San Francisco Bay area, rescuers searched through rubble for survivors of Tuesday's temblor, and residents picked their way through glass-strewn streets.
19/wsj_1924:In Oakland, hopes faded for finding any more survivors within the concrete and steel from the collapse of an interstate highway.
19/wsj_1924:At least 270 people were reported killed and 1,400 injured in the rush-hour tremor that caused billions of dollars of damage along 100 miles of the San Andreas fault.
19/wsj_1924:The baseball commissioner said the third game of the World Series between the Giants and the Athletics would be played Tuesday in Candlestick Park. 
19/wsj_1924:HONECKER WAS OUSTED as leader of East Germany amid growing unrest. 
19/wsj_1924:The 77-year-old official, who oversaw the building of the Berlin Wall, was removed during a meeting of the 163-member Communist Party Central Committee in East Berlin.
19/wsj_1924:He was succeeded by internal-security chief Egon Krenz, 52, a hard-liner who quickly ruled out any sharing of power with pro-democracy groups. 
19/wsj_1924:Honecker's departure came after weeks of street protests and an exodus to the West of East Germans who had become disenchanted with his rule. 
19/wsj_1924:At a nationally televised legislative session in Budapest, the Parliament overwhelmingly approved changes formally ending one-party domination in the country, regulating free elections by next summer and establishing the office of state president to replace a 21-member council.
19/wsj_1924:The country was renamed the Republic of Hungary.
19/wsj_1924:The voting for new laws followed dissolution of Hungary's Communist Party this month and its replacement by a Western-style Socialist Party. 
19/wsj_1924:The space shuttle Atlantis blasted into orbit from Cape Canaveral, Fla., and its crew of five astronauts launched the nuclear-powered Galileo space probe on a flight to the planet Jupiter.
19/wsj_1924:South Korea's President Roh addressed a joint House-Senate meeting and urged patience over U.S. demands for the opening of Seoul's markets to more American goods, saying trade issues would be "resolved to mutual satisfaction." He also said tragic results could follow any "hint of weakening" of the U.S. defense commitment to Seoul. 
19/wsj_1924:The Census Bureau reported that 13.1% of the U.S. population, or 31.9 million people, were living in poverty in 1988.
19/wsj_1924:The Bush administration accused Israeli Prime Minister Shamir of hindering peace efforts in the Mideast with "unhelpful" and disappointing statements.
19/wsj_1924:But other nations at the opening of the 49-nation meeting of Britain and its former colonies pressed for continued or stronger embargoes in an effort to end apartheid. 
19/wsj_1924:Colombia's judges launched a 72-hour strike to press security demands following Tuesday's murder of a High Court justice in Medellin.
19/wsj_1924:Most of the country's 20,000 judges and judicial employees joined the work stoppage. 
19/wsj_1925:Charles S. Mitchell, a vice president with Homart Development Co., the real estate development subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Co., was named president of Figgie Properties, a real estate development unit.
19/wsj_1925:Also, Richard A. Barkley, a former marketing executive with FMC Corp., was appointed president of Continental Container Systems, a producer of can closing machinery that Figgie acquired late last year.
19/wsj_1926:The decline broke a streak of 10 quarters in which Dow posted earnings increases. 
19/wsj_1926:A spokeswoman said Dow is comfortable with Wall Street expectations that full-year earnings will total about $14.60 a share, compared with last year's record net of $2.4 billion, or $12.76 a share.
19/wsj_1926:But that signal on full-year profit casts doubt on whether Dow will improve on its year-ago fourth-quarter net of $3.44 a share, or $635 million.
19/wsj_1926:Dow officials were signaling that the company would earn less than $15 a share this year even before they announced in July a plan to acquire 67% of Marion Laboratories Inc.
19/wsj_1926:For the first nine months of the year, Dow earned $2.06 billion, or $11.41 a share, up 17% from $1.76 billion, or $9.32 a share, a year ago.
19/wsj_1927:Ethan Bronner's "Battle for Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America" (Norton, 399 pages, $22.50) is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings, done with journalistic verve, but with a flawed legal philosophy.
19/wsj_1927:What shook America was not a battle for justice but for naked power, in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge they had demonized. 
19/wsj_1927:In its basic structure and style the book is novelistic, with piquant character portrayal, hard-wire action and devious intrigue of the sort more likely to be encountered in a Washington docudrama than in a constitutional history. 
19/wsj_1927:Given Democratic frustration with the Reagan victories and Court appointments, the contingency plans in place, and Mr. Bork's paper trail of vulnerable writings, it was pretty clear that Judge Bork never stood much chance of being confirmed.
19/wsj_1927:As Mr. Bronner himself says, the smell of "raw meat" was in the air. 
19/wsj_1927:Ralph Neas was the organizing genius, whipping a conglomerate of pressure groups into an irresistible attacking force.
19/wsj_1927:But it was Ted Kennedy who scored most effectively with his searing portrayal of "Robert Bork's America" -- the parade of imaginary horribles that would follow logically, he claimed, from the positions Mr. Bork had taken over the space of two decades.
19/wsj_1927:Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania engaged the nominee in a verbal contest aimed at showing that Mr. Bork was willing to stretch the Constitution in one area (free speech) while remaining rigid in all the others.
19/wsj_1927:It achieved a good media play, and enabled Sen. Specter and others to vote against Mr. Bork out of "conscience." Further ammunition came from left legal theorist Ronald Dworkin, who in the New York Review of Books painted a picture of a constitutional zombie willfully reading his personal prejudices into the Constitution, particularly in the area of "original intent." The charge of being "outside the mainstream" of legal thought gravely undercut Mr. Bork's scholarly standing, leaving him bleeding on the platform. 
19/wsj_1927:The nomination still might have been salvaged if a number of Democratic moderates in the South and Southwest had broken party lines.
19/wsj_1927:But Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnson of Louisiana reminded the little band that anti-Bork blacks and women could furnish the margin to punish them in their next Senate elections.
19/wsj_1927:Yet with the smooth confirmation of Anthony Kennedy, an "80 percenter" only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than Mr. Bork, the Democrats may have won the battle but lost the war. 
19/wsj_1927:Probing more deeply into the doctrine of "judicial restraint," he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of Justice Holmes.
19/wsj_1927:Still, the long view of Robert Bork as constitutional thinker must be a spotty one.
19/wsj_1927:His strength lies in his majoritarian doctrine, which keeps the Court clear of transient group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives.
19/wsj_1927:Unfortunately, Mr. Bork failed to distinguish between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that must be settled judicially if it is to cohere. 
19/wsj_1927:The question of segregated schools, in Brown vs.
19/wsj_1927:Board of Education, was such an issue.
19/wsj_1927:In our time abortion has become another, best left to a line of Supreme Court decisions rather than to the chaos of 50 state legislatures.
19/wsj_1927:A reflective and growing consensus of Americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters (decided in the Griswold case) to abortion as well.
19/wsj_1927:One can understand Mr. Bork's fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched, though a Supreme Court composed of men and women with realism, guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it.
19/wsj_1928:Sotheby's Inc., the world's biggest auction house, is taking a huge Wall Street-style risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr., the Campbell Soup Co. heir. 
19/wsj_1928:The Financial Services division has guaranteed the Dorrance family that it will receive a minimum of $100 million for the collection, regardless of what the bids for the art works total, people close to the transaction say.
19/wsj_1928:The collection, which includes two early Picassos, a van Gogh, a Monet, other paintings, furniture and porcelains, went on sale last night in the first of six auctions. 
19/wsj_1928:A corporation that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a Wall Street firm, which purchases the securities outright, accepting the financial risk of finding buyers.
19/wsj_1928:That was slightly above Sotheby's presale estimate of $111 million.
19/wsj_1928:Normally, Sotheby's would have earned 20% of the total in commissions.
19/wsj_1928:Instead, people familiar with the transaction said, the auction house opted to forgo that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding $100 million. 
19/wsj_1928:Art dealers say that while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price, a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented. 
19/wsj_1928:Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America division, vehemently denies it offered the Dorrance heirs a money-back guarantee, calling such reports "inaccurate." Buried in the glossy hardbound catalog for the sale, however, appears the statement, "Sotheby's has an interest in the property in this catalog." 
19/wsj_1928:We have some level of financial interest" in the collection. "We don't disclose specifics." 
19/wsj_1928:Frank Mirabello, a lawyer for the Dorrance estate with the Philadelphia law firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, declines to comment on the financial arrangements. 
19/wsj_1928:When Christie's officials asked why the firm wasn't picked to sell the Dorrance collection, representatives of the Dorrance family "told us it was a question of financial considerations," said Michael Findlay, Christie's head of impressionist and modern paintings. 
19/wsj_1928:Collectors who have made their money on Wall Street have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art boom, but recently it appears Sotheby's has been returning the compliment. 
19/wsj_1928:In November 1987, Sotheby's essentially offered a Wall Street-style "bridge loan" of about $27 million to Australian businessman Alan Bond to enable him to purchase Vincent van Gogh's "Irises" for $53.9 million.
19/wsj_1928:It was the highest bid in history for a work of art.
19/wsj_1928:Sotheby's is offering such deals because it's an art sellers' market, at least where the best works are concerned, says Ralph Lerner, an attorney and author of the book "Art Law." "There seems to be a lot of art for sale, but there's more competition.
19/wsj_1928:The Dorrance family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds above $100 million, people familiar with the transaction said.
19/wsj_1928:At a news conference last May announcing plans for the auction, Sotheby's estimated its value in excess of $100 million.
19/wsj_1928:The decision to put the entire collection on the block stunned many, since Mr. Dorrance had served as chairman of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and it had been assumed many of the works would be donated to the institution. 
19/wsj_1928:At last night's sale, 13 of 44 works that sold were purchased by Aska International Gallery, the art-acquisition unit of Aichi Financial, a Japanese conglomerate that owns 7.5% of Christie's. 
19/wsj_1928:In such situations, he says, the house "is going to put the best light on things." For example, an auction house's comments on the condition of a work of art that is up for sale should be looked at with "very open eyes," he says. 
19/wsj_1928:"There's more and more of this cash-up-front going on at every level," says Bruce Miller, president of Art Funding Corp., an art lender.
19/wsj_1928:In January, two small New York galleries, the Coe Kerr Gallery and Beadleston Fine Arts, snatched a major art collection owned by the Askin family away from rival auction-house bidders with an up-front payment of about $25 million. 
19/wsj_1929:Mr. Krenz, age 52, is known as an old-guard ironfist, one likely to continue the method of running a country that the Berlin Wall made famous.
19/wsj_1929:Even if he were to change his stripes and become another Milton Friedman, however, he would still stand a good chance of losing a country. 
19/wsj_1929:Mr. Krenz almost certainly will be a younger version of Erich Honecker, his rigid predecessor as dictator.
19/wsj_1929:More recently, Mr. Krenz has been in charge of East German security, and is the youngest member of the ruling Politburo. 
19/wsj_1929:In this scenario it's hard to imagine that a pale imitation of the Federal Republic could avoid being pulled into some kind of tie -- economic, federal or stronger -- with West Germany. 
19/wsj_1929:Mr. Krenz may need a bit of time to consolidate his empire, which would do a lot to promote Reunification Scenario One.
19/wsj_1929:Of course East Germany, true to its tradition, could tighten its borders yet further.
19/wsj_1929:Two of the last gestures of the Honecker regime were to close the border to Czechoslovakia and install halogen lights in some spots along the frontier.
19/wsj_1929:Czech reformers can recall the Wilsonian ideals of the same period in their country.
19/wsj_1929:But East Germany is merely "the land of truly existing socialism." Beyond that, it has to compete with West Germany for a claim to the German identity.
19/wsj_1929:Up to now, the main weapon of the "worker and peasant state" has been the ideology of socialism. 
19/wsj_1929:With talk today of a second economic miracle in West Germany, East Germany no longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser league.
19/wsj_1929:Without Moscow's military and party behind it, East Germany runs the risk of disintegrating.
19/wsj_1929:If it goes capitalist, and increases trade with West Germany, it will convert itself, willy-nilly, into an economic annex of the Federal Republic.
19/wsj_1929:Ideologues on the other side of the border can also slow the process.
19/wsj_1929:Helmut Kohl's governing conservative coalition is proving admirably true to the West German constitution by making more than 500,000 people of German descent automatic citizens this year alone.
19/wsj_1929:But it would be ironic if Germany's reunification, just like its division, eventually were the result of actions in centers of power other than Bonn and Berlin. 
19/wsj_1929:In a statement that was as close as East Germany gets to practicing "glasnost", Otto Reinhold, an East German party theorist, actually acknowledged the reunification dilemma. "The main problem," Mr. Reinhold said in an East German radio interview monitored by Radio Free Europe in Munich, stems from the fact that "the GDR is different" from other East European states. "What kind of right to exist," he asked, "would a capitalist German Democratic Republic have alongside a capitalist Federal Republic?" That's a question East Germany can't answer easily, no matter what its new leader does.

19/wsj_1931:News of the major earthquake in California Tuesday triggered a round of dollar sales in early Asian trade, but most foreign-exchange dealers said they expect the impact of the quake on financial markets to be short-lived. 
19/wsj_1931:Harris Trust's Mr. Woodland noted that the unit continues to show resilience in the face of a barrage of "headline negatives" in recent weeks, including rate increases in Europe and Japan, aggressive central bank intervention, a 190-point plunge in New York stock prices, an unexpectedly poor U.S. trade report and action by the Federal Reserve to nudge U.S. rates lower. 
19/wsj_1931:While Mr. Woodland doesn't predict a significant climb for the U.S. unit in light of recent moves in interest rates around the world, he noted that "its downside potential is surprisingly and -- for dollar bulls -- "impressively" limited. 
19/wsj_1931:In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 140.97 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 142.10 yen. 
19/wsj_1931:Since Friday's dive in stock market prices, the Fed has injected reserves into the banking system in an effort to calm the markets and avert a repeat of 1987's stock market debacle. 
19/wsj_1931:The Fed did, in fact, execute $1.5 billion of liquidity-enhancing customer repurchase agreements, the third set of repurchase orders in three days.
19/wsj_1931:Some dealers noted that nervousness over the recent sharp dive in stock prices could intensify following suggestions by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita that appeared to advise Japanese investors to be very careful in investing in U.S. leveraged buy-outs. 
19/wsj_1932:By yesterday morning, much of the world was still unable to reach San Francisco by telephone.
19/wsj_1932:At the opening of the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate for November delivery shot up 10 cents a barrel, to $20.85, still on the belief that the refineries were damaged. 
19/wsj_1932:In the San Francisco area, roughly 800,000 barrels a day of crude, about a third of all the refining capacity in California, is processed daily, according to industry data.
19/wsj_1932:For more than the past year, even the rumor of a major West Coast refinery shutdown has been enough to spark a futures rally because the gasoline market is so tight. 
19/wsj_1932:But yesterday, as the morning wore on, some major West Coast refinery operators -- including Chevron Corp., Exxon Corp. and the Shell Oil Co. unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group -- said their refineries weren't damaged and were continuing to operate normally.
19/wsj_1932:"The market was basically acting on two contradictory forces," said Nauman Barakat of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "One is the panic, the earthquake in San Francisco, which is positive." 
19/wsj_1932:COPPER: Futures prices eased on indications of improvement in the industry's labor situation.
19/wsj_1932:Another analyst said the Cananea return to operation may not be as near as some expect. "There are still negotiations taking place on whether there will be a loss of jobs, which has been a critical issue all along," he said.
19/wsj_1932:Both of these mines are normally major suppliers of copper to Japan, which has been buying copper on the world market.
19/wsj_1932:The first analyst said that the Japanese, as well as the Chinese, bought copper earlier in the week in London, but that this purchasing has since slackened as the supply situation, at least over the long term, appears to have improved. "The focus for some time has been on the copper supply, and good demand has been taken for granted," he said. "Now that the supply situation seems to be improving, it would be best for traders to switch their concentration to the demand side." He noted the Commerce Department report yesterday that housing starts in September dropped 5.2% from August to 1.26 million units on an annualized basis, the lowest level in seven years. "Along with these factors, other economic reports suggest a slowing of the economy, which could mean reduced copper usage," he said. 
19/wsj_1932:The March delivery ended with an advance of 0.16 cent a pound to 14.27 cents, for a two-day gain of 0.3 cent.
19/wsj_1932:According to one dealer, Japan said it has only 40,000 tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this year by Cuba under current commitments.
19/wsj_1932:The announcement was made because of reports Tuesday that Cuba would delay shipments to Japan scheduled for later this year, into early next year.
19/wsj_1932:That country recently bought 200,000 tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but didn't. "It's known they need the sugar, and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support," the dealer said. 
19/wsj_1932:LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: The Agriculture Department is expected to announce tomorrow that the number of cattle in the 13 major ranch states slipped 4% to 8.21 million on Oct. 1 compared with the level a year earlier, said Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill.
19/wsj_1932:Cattle prices have risen in recent weeks on speculation that the government's quarterly report will signal tighter supplies of beef.
19/wsj_1932:Among other things, the government is expected to report that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter slipped 3%.
19/wsj_1932:Feedlots fatten cattle for slaughter, so a drop indicates that the production of beef will dip this winter.
19/wsj_1932:Indeed, some analysts expect the government to report that the movement of young cattle onto feedlots in the month of September in seven big ranch states dropped 8% compared with the level for September 1988.

19/wsj_1934:A new drug to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used on more than 100 patients at the University of Pittsburgh, according to researchers. 
19/wsj_1934:Only two of 111 transplants have been rejected. 
19/wsj_1934:"We're shocked by it, because it's worked so fast," said Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, director of the University of Pittsburgh Transplantation Program, at a news conference here yesterday. "We consider it a life-saving drug, like one for AIDS," said Dr. John Fung, an immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh. 
19/wsj_1934:They are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of FK-506, compared with cyclosporine, which can cause renal failure, morbidity, nausea and other problems. "The side effects {of cyclosporine} have made the penalty for its success rather high," Dr. Starzl said. 
19/wsj_1934:There are no firm plans to expand the experimental program beyond the University of Pittsburgh, whose hospital performs the most transplants in the world. 
19/wsj_1934:Researchers couldn't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market, but they said FK-506 will enable patients to cut hospital stays by 50% and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the dosage of cyclosporine and other drugs among transplant recipients. 
19/wsj_1934:Dr. Starzl said the research has been largely financed by the National Institute of Health and by university funds, and that Fujisawa didn't give the hospital any grants.
19/wsj_1934:"We've known for six months the effect of this drug, and our advice to our people has been not to buy the company's stock," Dr. Starzl said, adding that profiting from FK-506 wouldn't be ethical. 
19/wsj_1935:Economist David N. Laband's Sept. 27 editorial-page article, "In Hugo's Path, a Man-Made Disaster," decries the control of price gouging, swiftly ordered by South Carolina's governor after Hurricane Hugo.
19/wsj_1935:Yet in Mr. Laband's rehash of free-market logic, human greed and self-interest are the only permissible psychological reactions.
19/wsj_1935:Moreover, essential relief supplies such as ice must be distributed throughout the population because of potential health problems from spoiled food and possible outbreak of disease.
19/wsj_1935:Such spillover effects give the state a right to intervene in the marketplace and temporarily coordinate allocation of resources. 
19/wsj_1935:These latter-day scalawags would be ill-advised to take advantage of the situation, if they ever expect to face the people of South Carolina again.
19/wsj_1935:Mr. Laband, meanwhile, gets an A for his rote recital of economic-efficiency arguments.
19/wsj_1935:Give him an F for his failure to understand the ethics of economic equity. 
19/wsj_1935:Of Douglas Woodward's Honors Economics Class, 
19/wsj_1935:University of South Carolina 
19/wsj_1935:I'm surprised he didn't advocate letting people loot, since that behavior can also be foreseen in a disaster and "every individual has an incentive to alter the distribution of income in his favor." Price controls were "so fervently embraced by Charleston" because price gouging in this situation is equivalent to looting. 
19/wsj_1935:Mr. Laband described one of the more insidious threats we face when dealing with disasters such as Hugo -- anti-profiteering ordinances such as that by the Charleston City Council as it thrashed about trying to Do Something. 
19/wsj_1935:Since he concentrated on the economic folly of such ordinances, he didn't mention certain other of their effects.
19/wsj_1935:And they, or even the prospect of them, discourage disaster preparedness in the form of speculative advance stocking of supplies by merchants. 
19/wsj_1935:Would Mr. Laband also suggest that the Red Cross, Salvation Army, military units, police, fire departments, rescue units and individual citizens cease their efforts to assist Hugo's victims because they interfere with his concept of the "free market"? 
19/wsj_1935:What about those caring people all over the country who are donating food, water and other necessities of life to these people who could be any of us?
19/wsj_1935:Their recovery came surprisingly fast, and always with the help of neighbors.
19/wsj_1935:The shock of seeing homes destroyed and city services disrupted may cause some to confuse priorities such as the true economic value of a freezer full of meat. 
19/wsj_1935:We here in the affected areas were dazzled by Mr. Laband's analysis of time values and his comparisons of effectiveness concerning research and development.
19/wsj_1935:Perhaps, considering the value of our time, we will be unable to patronize their establishments in the post-Hugo era. 
19/wsj_1935:I have a question for Mr. Laband: How do I explain to the single mother of three standing in line next to me for the past three hours that the two bags of ice she needs to keep her children's food edible will take her last $20?
19/wsj_1936:Though the Cubs' championship season ended with the National League playoffs, a revival of the Organic Theater's production of "Bleacher Bums," a play in nine innings set in the Wrigley Field bleachers, continues within spitting distance of the ballpark. 
19/wsj_1936:Revivals of a different sort also are being offered by our two major theater troupes, the Goodman and Steppenwolf.
19/wsj_1936:Each is more problematic than an unexpected divisional baseball championship, but both help explain why Chicago remains a vital center of this country's regional theater movement. 
19/wsj_1936:The Goodman is offering a modernized version of Moliere's "The Misanthrope" through Nov. 4.
19/wsj_1936:He is the jealous friend of Philinte, and the jealous lover of Celimene.
19/wsj_1936:Twenty-five years ago the poet Richard Wilbur modernized this 17th-century comedy merely by avoiding "the zounds sort of thing," as he wrote in his introduction.
19/wsj_1936:If Mr. Wilbur's translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of 17th-century Paris, Mr. Falls's production is a mirror in which we see ourselves. 
19/wsj_1936:Mr. Bartlett had slimmed Moliere's cast of characters to six and set them in the London media world of Thatcherite Britain.
19/wsj_1936:The Steppenwolf Theatre Company, back from a critical and box office success in London with its adaptation of Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath," opened the new season with Harold Pinter's "The Homecoming," first produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1965. 
19/wsj_1936:Back then, Mr. Pinter was not only the angry young British playwright, but also the first to use silences and sentence fragments and menacing stares, almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue.
19/wsj_1936:When "The Homecoming" was first produced on this side of the Atlantic, actors and directors were reverential.
19/wsj_1936:This kind of theater was new to us.
19/wsj_1936:Led by a near-perfect performance by Alan Wilder as Max, the father, the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family's rage, bitterness, fear and isolation.
19/wsj_1936:Encouraged by Mr. Wilder's sly grins, embarrassed grimaces and sputtering rages, the audience gets the joke and begins to laugh before the end of the first act. 
19/wsj_1936:Three of the family members, Max and his two sons, Lenny and Joey, live off the flesh: Max is a retired butcher, Lenny a pimp and Joey an aspiring boxer.
19/wsj_1936:Teddy, the eldest of Max's sons, has made the most dramatic escape by becoming a professor of philosophy at an American university. 
19/wsj_1936:Though it's clearly Max's wife who held sway here until her death, now none of the other male residents of this misbegotten household can challenge Max.
19/wsj_1936:The play concerns Teddy's homecoming with his wife of six years, Ruth.
19/wsj_1936:As Ruth, Moira Harris, a large and beautiful woman who may be our next Colleen Dewhurst, begins almost immediately to overpower each of the men.
19/wsj_1936:We have seen her develop within a few hours from a shy and unknown in-law to a goddess of the flesh who will replace the dead mother, and then some. 
19/wsj_1936:While Steppenwolf was in London with "The Grapes of Wrath," Bruce Sagan, the president of its board of directors, quietly returned to Chicago to buy a piece of real estate in the city's rapidly reviving North Halsted Street restaurant and theater district.
19/wsj_1936:The troupe currently performs in a converted dairy that seats 211 and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple one-set production. "If we wanted to stage `Death of a Salesman, ' " Mr. Sagan says, "Willie Loman would have to live in a ranch house because of the low ceiling." 
19/wsj_1936:Mr. Sagan, a former publisher and real estate developer, has put together an $8 million financial package that includes approximately $4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of Illinois (the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a theater), and approximately $1 million in grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the MacArthur Foundation, and a few other deep pockets.
19/wsj_1936:Mr. Sagan compares the importance of Steppenwolf with Orson Welles's Mercury Theater in the '30s.
19/wsj_1936:What will Mr. Sagan do with his new theater building if the allure of Hollywood and Broadway proves too much for such Steppenwolf stalwarts as John Malkovich ("Dangerous Liaisons"), Joan Allen ("The Heidi Chronicles"), and Glenne Headly ("Lonesome Dove"), and the company crumbles? "That's OK," Mr. Sagan replies. "Let this building be Steppenwolf's legacy to Chicago theater." 
19/wsj_1937:After enduring three days of heavy selling, the beleaguered Nasdaq over-the-counter market finally rebounded, rising sharply in hearty trading. 
19/wsj_1937:Richard Bruno, head of OTC trading at PaineWebber, said the OTC market has a habit of lagging big moves on the New York Stock Exchange.
19/wsj_1937:Much of the jockeying by OTC traders and investors centered on shares of companies that might be financially affected by damage from the devastating earthquake in northern California.
19/wsj_1937:As investors speculated about the long- and short-term implications, shares of a number of companies that might either profit or face problems because of the disaster were actively traded.
19/wsj_1937:Insurance-related stocks were mixed as investors tried to figure out how to assess the impact of the property damage and deaths on those concerns.
19/wsj_1937:Then, if the stocks fell sharply, he planned to begin buying them aggressively, on the theory that the companies that insure against property damage and accidents will have to raise rates eventually to compensate for the claims they will pay to earthquake victims and victims of last month's Hurricane Hugo.
19/wsj_1937:Many investors expected damage from the hurricane to be the catalyst for higher rates in the industry, which has been depressed because of low rates arising from intense competition.
19/wsj_1937:The Nasdaq Insurance Index jumped 4.15 to 529.32 on the day, while the barometer of big insurance and banking issues climbed 1.72 to 455.29. 
19/wsj_1937:Shares of Kasler, a California road and bridge builder, were heavily traded, jumping 2 1/8 to 9 7/8 on 1.3 million shares. 
19/wsj_1937:Traders were initially nervous about shares of companies, including many leading OTC computer companies, such as Apple Computer with offices in the vicinity of the area damaged by the quake.
19/wsj_1937:But most of those stocks fared well.
19/wsj_1937:Shares of biotechnology companies in the area were also higher.
19/wsj_1937:The stocks of computer-related companies located outside California improved, too.
19/wsj_1937:In other earthquake-related news, Hambrecht & Quist's OTC market makers were excused from trading yesterday and its positions were frozen for the day by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
19/wsj_1937:Jaguar's American depositary receipts added 3/8 to 10 3/4 on volume of 1.1 million.
19/wsj_1937:Analysts figure Amgen could benefit as a result of troubles facing its competitor, Genetics Institute, over the anti-anemia drug EPO. Genetics Institute disclosed recently that it is embroiled in a dispute with Boehringer Mannheim, which distributes the drug, regarding the usability of some batches. 
19/wsj_1938:The companies earlier said they didn't want to raise their offer to match a rival bid by Institut Merieux S.A. of C$37 a share, or C$942 million.
19/wsj_1938:Institut Merieux's bid for Toronto-based Connaught has run into problems with the Canadian government, which told Merieux last week that it wasn't convinced that the proposed acquisition would be of "net benefit" to Canada.
19/wsj_1939:Within minutes after the stock market closed Friday, I called Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, advised him that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined by 190 points late that afternoon, and cheerfully informed him that he and his fellow Democrats were to blame. 
19/wsj_1939:But he knows that as many as 20 of his fellow Democrats are disposed to vote for the cut, popular among their constituents. 
19/wsj_1939:He helped persuade 10 of these senators to support him and Majority Leader George Mitchell on these grounds.
19/wsj_1939:The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been in the forefront in supporting the Bush proposal.
19/wsj_1939:Mr. Rahn was shocked, telephoning the office of Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the administration's chief strategist on this issue.
19/wsj_1939:He left a message accusing Mr. Darman of selling out.
19/wsj_1939:The stock market, after all, represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation's capital stock, discounted to present value. 
19/wsj_1939:Why should it be so surprising that a 30% cut in the capital-gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the nation's capital stock?
19/wsj_1939:The total value of privately held assets is easily more than $15 trillion.
19/wsj_1939:If the tax on any gain to those assets was doubled, wouldn't the value fall to the owners of the assets?
19/wsj_1939:Isn't it reasonable to assume that the asset you own would be worth more if the government suddenly announced that if you sold it, you would be able to keep 30% more of its gain than you previously believed?
19/wsj_1939:Instead, the press corps readily accepted the notion that a snag in the takeover financing of United Airlines instantly knocked 7% off the value of the nation's capital stock and caused convulsions around the world.
19/wsj_1939:For one thing, quite a number of the leading spokesmen on Wall Street are not portfolio managers, who understand that the value of assets is greatly affected by how government taxes those assets.
19/wsj_1939:That is, with capital gains cut, the glue of the 1986 accord will be gone, and political realities will push up income-tax rates.
19/wsj_1939:The counter-argument, which he has heard, is that if he and his fellow Democrats are successful in killing the president's proposal, the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy.
19/wsj_1939:In this atmosphere, there would be no serious consideration of tax increases.
19/wsj_1939:If Sen. Bradley would permit a vote on capital gains, though, it would pass, Christmas retail sales would be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock market, the 1990 economy would be robust, and the revenue gains at every level of government, including New Jersey's, would be surprisingly high.
19/wsj_1939:Mr. Wanniski is president of Polyconomics Inc., of Morristown, N.J. 
19/wsj_1940:Federal prosecutors said they have obtained a guilty plea from another person in the government's ongoing probe of illegal payments in the record industry.

19/wsj_1940:As part of his plea agreement with the government, the 44-year-old Mr. Craig faces a maximum of three years in prison.

19/wsj_1943:Proceeds from the bonds, with coupon rates in the 8% range, will be used to replace bonds with an average interest rate of 13.1%.
19/wsj_1943:The refinancing is part of the TVA's strategy of dealing with what has been an intractable problem: its staggering $18.5 billion debt, most of which is owed to the Treasury Department's Federal Financing Bank.
19/wsj_1943:The TVA currently plans to issue a total of $6.7 billion in bonds to refinance its high-interest debt. 
19/wsj_1943:The $4 billion bond issue also will help the TVA meet its goal of not raising rates for another year, said William F. Malec, the agency's chief financial officer. 
19/wsj_1943:The $4 billion in bonds break down as follows: $1 billion in five-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.25% and a yield to maturity of 8.33%; $1 billion in 10-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.375% and a yield to maturity of 8.42%; $2 billion in 30-year bonds with five-year call protection, a coupon rate of 8.75% and a yield to maturity of 9.06%.
19/wsj_1943:Managing the bond issue is a group of investment banks headed by First Boston Corp. and co-managed by Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Morgan Stanley & Co., and Salomon Brothers Inc. 
19/wsj_1944:Mutual-fund czar John M. Templeton has put his money where his moniker is, pouring $1.4 million into one of his own funds, the Templeton Value Fund. 
19/wsj_1944:Mr. Templeton owns shares in several of the 33 funds that his firm manages, but only in three of the 10 available to U.S. investors, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
19/wsj_1944:In addition, Mr. Templeton received a dividend of 22 cents a share Oct. 5.

19/wsj_1944:On Sept. 6, Robert Joseph Sherry, the firm's senior vice president of employee and public relations, sold 4,000 shares, leaving himself with 1,062 shares of James River.

19/wsj_1944:INTEREST-RATE PLAYER: Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. tops the companies portion of the accompanying Insider Trading table this week.
19/wsj_1944:Three of the utility's directors have at least doubled their holdings in the company since July. 
19/wsj_1944:Mr. Taft, who is also president of Taft Broadcasting Co., said he bought the shares because he keeps a utility account at the brokerage firm of Salomon Brothers Inc., which had recommended the stock as a good buy.
19/wsj_1944:Mr. Taft paid an average of $28.43 for each share.
19/wsj_1944:A company spokesman said he couldn't explain their sudden bullishness. "I don't know of any news or anything unusual happening here," said Bruce Stoecklin, director of media services. 
19/wsj_1946:In one of the first indoor air-pollution cases to go to trial, a state-court jury decided in favor of the defendant, Burlington Industries Inc. 
19/wsj_1946:Glenn and Sharon Beebe of Cincinnati had sued the com- pany in 1981 after installing Burlington carpets in their office.
19/wsj_1946:As a result of their illness, the Beebes said, they lost $1.8 million in wages and earnings.
19/wsj_1946:In addition, they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances. 
19/wsj_1946:Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case, she said. 
19/wsj_1946:The Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court dismissed six lawsuits attempting to block a $2.5 billion project planned for 42nd Street in Manhattan. 
19/wsj_1946:Opponents of the project had claimed that the city and the state of New York, which are co-sponsoring the project, had failed to adhere to environmental guidelines. 
19/wsj_1946:All but two of the 40 or so lawsuits that have been filed since the project's 1984 approval have been dismissed before the trial stage.
19/wsj_1946:But developers of four planned office towers cautioned that obstacles still remain.
19/wsj_1946:As part of the agreement with the state, the developers -- a partnership of Park Tower Realty and Prudential Insurance Co. of America -- said they would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was "significant litigation" pending. 
19/wsj_1946:Park Tower General Counsel Matthew Mayer said the development team will have to review two additional lawsuits before putting up a $155 million letter of credit to cover condemnation costs.
19/wsj_1946:FEDERAL JUDGE EXPANDS role of U.S. courts in extradition decisions. 
19/wsj_1946:U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn, N.Y., ruled that a man implicated in an attack on an Israeli passenger bus in 1986 can be extradited to Israel for trial. 
19/wsj_1946:However, Judge Weinstein wrote in his opinion late last month that terrorism and acts of war against civilians cannot be defined as political acts. 
19/wsj_1946:To do so, the judge said, the U.S. courts must review the judicial process in the foreign country independently of the State Department's assessment.
19/wsj_1946:FORMER CANADIAN AMBASSADOR to the U.S. Allan E. Gotlieb has joined the Philadelphia law firm of Pepper, Hamilton & Scheetz as a consultant.
19/wsj_1946:Mr. Gotlieb, who serves as a consultant to Stikeman, Elliott, one of Canada's biggest law firms, is advising Pepper Hamilton's Washington office on legal matters related to Canadian-U.S. investment, corporate finance and international transactions. 
19/wsj_1946:QUOTABLE: In a speech prepared for delivery in New York yesterday, retired Justice Lewis Powell contested the notion that the last Supreme Court term marked a turn toward conservatism: "Commentators who agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a `shift in direction' on the court. . . . I take these pronouncements, like many that have preceded them in past years, with a grain of salt.
19/wsj_1946:In an era of `sound bites' and instant opinion polls it is dangerous to apply broad labels to a single term." 
19/wsj_1947:(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 
19/wsj_1947:The Arab states, always bitterly resentful of U.S. support toward Israel, realized they held an irresistable weapon -- oil.
19/wsj_1947:By 1973, the U.S. was bringing in two million barrels of Arab oil a day, more than 10% of the 17.3 million barrels consumed daily. 
19/wsj_1947:The spot dislocations that showed up were largely the result of confusion (much of it in Washington), though that was cold comfort for drivers waiting in mile-long lines at the gas pumps. 
19/wsj_1947:The embargo lasted only six months, but the price hikes became a fact of life.
19/wsj_1948:The figures don't include substantial dividends on holdings of Bear Stearns stock.
19/wsj_1948:Because it operates on a fiscal year, Bear Stearns's yearly filings are available much earlier than those of other firms.
19/wsj_1948:The latest period includes 14 months instead of 12 because Bear Stearns changed to a fiscal year ending in June instead of April. 
19/wsj_1948:However, Bear Stearns on Monday reported improved earnings for its first quarter, ended Sept. 29, partly because of a 31% increase in commissions during the quarter. 
19/wsj_1948:William J. Montgoris, chief financial officer, defended the lofty salaries at Bear Stearns. "All of us are on a base salary of $200,000 if the firm makes nothing -- and that's pretty low as far as Wall Street goes," Mr. Montgoris said.
19/wsj_1948:Mr. Montgoris said the firm has a "straight mathematical formula" for determining compensation, based on the firm's earnings. "Just because a particular element of the firm is down," such as stockbrokerage, "doesn't mean the executive committee should be paid less," he said. 
19/wsj_1949:Morgan Grenfell Group PLC said John Craven, group chief executive officer, is taking over the chairmanship of the merchant banking group from Sir Peter Carey, who is retiring. 
19/wsj_1949:Mr. Carey will remain a member of the merchant bank's board. 
19/wsj_1949:Mr. Craven said his move to the chairmanship means he will take a less active role in the day-to-day management of the group, but he added that the merchant bank's strategic focus remains unchanged. 
19/wsj_1949:Mr. Craven joined Morgan Grenfell as group chief executive in May 1987, a few months after the resignations of former Chief Executive Christopher Reeves and other top officials because of the merchant bank's role in Guinness PLC's controversial takeover of Distiller's Co. in 1986. 
19/wsj_1949:News of Mr. Eward's retirement comes one day after Morgan said that Christopher Whittington resigned as chairman of Morgan's banking subsidiary to join a financial services firm. 
19/wsj_1950:Lockheed Corp. -- $300 million of 9 3/8% notes due Oct. 15, 1999, priced at 99.90 to yield 9.39%.

19/wsj_1950:Pennsylvania Higher Education Facilities Authority -- approximately $117 million of revenue bonds for Hahnemann University, Series 1989, due 1990-2002, 2009 and 2019, priced late Monday by a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group to yield from 6% in 1990 to 7.282% in 2019.
19/wsj_1950:There are about $25.6 million of 7.2% term bonds due 2009, priced to yield 7.25%, and about $66.8 million of 7.2% term bonds due 2019, priced at 99 to yield 7.282%.

19/wsj_1950:Redland International Funding PLC (U.K. parent) -- 150 million Australian dollars of 15 3/8% bonds due Nov. 8, 1996, priced at 101 3/4 to yield 15.44% less full fees, via JP Morgan Securities Ltd. Guaranteed by Redland PLC. Fees 2. 
19/wsj_1950:Tennessee Valley Authority -- A $4 billion, three-part offering of power bonds priced through an underwriting group led by First Boston Corp.
19/wsj_1950:The size of the issue was increased from an originally planned $3 billion.
19/wsj_1950:The first part, consisting of $2 billion of bonds due Oct. 1, 2019, with a five-year non-call provision, was priced as 8 3/4% securities at 96.808 to yield 9.06%.
19/wsj_1950:The 30-year issue was priced at a spread of 105 basis points above the Treasury's 30-year bellwether bond.
19/wsj_1950:The second part, consisting of $1 billion of noncallable bonds due Oct. 1, 1999, was priced as 8 3/8% securities at 99.691 to yield 8.42%.
19/wsj_1950:The 10-year issue was priced at a spread of 43 basis points above the Treasury's 10-year note.
19/wsj_1950:The third part, consisting of $1 billion of noncallable bonds due Oct. 1, 1994, was priced as 8 1/4% securities at 99.672 to yield 8.33%.
19/wsj_1950:The five-year issue was priced at a spread of 43 basis points above the Treasury's comparable note.
19/wsj_1951:Par also said it was advised by the U.S. attorney for Maryland that it is one of a number of companies being investigated by a federal grand jury for alleged violations of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
19/wsj_1951:Par, a generic-drug maker that has been plagued by management problems, was already the subject of a federal criminal inquiry into the drug-approval process and a Food and Drug Administration investigation. 
19/wsj_1951:At the time, the company said it was recalling one of its drugs and had stopped selling two others.
19/wsj_1951:The spokesman said he also understood that the inquiry related to the existence of an "off-the-record" production book.
19/wsj_1951:Also yesterday, Ashok Patel, a former Par official who pleaded guilty to providing an FDA employee an illegal gratuity of $3,000, was sentenced by a federal judge in Baltimore to one year of community service and a $150,000 fine.
19/wsj_1951:Mr. Patel resigned as senior vice president of Par in April.
19/wsj_1951:Par said it selected him for the posts of president and chief executive on a permanent basis because of his experience in the industry and his performance at Par.
19/wsj_1951:Perry Levine, chairman, said Mr. Sawyer had "taken significant steps" to restore the company's credibility and sense of professionalism and integrity. 
19/wsj_1952:Congress, with a measure of White House complicity, has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills. (Indeed without earlier manipulations, the current sequester of $16 billion would have been even larger.) We suspect voters are fed up with the finagling.
19/wsj_1952:However, the Associated Press's account of the Monday sequester order signed by President Bush neatly captured the contempt Congress shows toward the notion of a legally binding commitment: "Lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a deficit-cutting bill." 
19/wsj_1952:George Bush's continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of pressuring Congress to make choices among competing priorities, rather than just saying yes to all the grateful special-interest constituencies that fill the PAC trough.
19/wsj_1952:If Washington's elites ever succeed in bursting the tax dam, Americans will be engulfed in a red sea of new spending programs, such as federalized child care. 
19/wsj_1952:Child care was one of the many "extraneous" bills pulled out of the Senate's reconciliation bill last Friday.
19/wsj_1952:Others were the capital-gains cut, Section 89 repeal, the disabled workers bill, and the unprecedented reconsideration of the catastrophic health act.
19/wsj_1952:This is the way government is supposed to work, with politicians taking responsibility for votes that their constituents can identify, instead of concealing them in the great reconciliation garbage truck. 
19/wsj_1952:Nor do we see any reason to believe that a metropolitan Washington that has gotten fat and rich and lazy in the shadow of the federal colossus will change much on its own initiative. 
19/wsj_1953:Exchange seats hit a peak of $1,150,000 in September 1987. 
19/wsj_1954:The Canadian government auctioned 750 million Canadian dollars (US$637.5 million) of 9.25% bonds due Dec. 15, 1994. 
19/wsj_1954:The average accepted yield bid was 9.617% for a price equivalent of 98.523. 
19/wsj_1954:Proceeds of the sale will be used to redeem C$675 million of government bonds maturing Nov. 1 and for general government purposes. 
19/wsj_1955:Northern Trust Corp. said its board adopted a shareholder rights plan aimed at deterring unwanted takeover bids, but said it's not aware of any plan to acquire the banking concern. 
19/wsj_1955:Under Northern Trust's plan, shareholders were issued rights that, in the event of certain attempted takeovers, allow holders to buy shares in the company at half price. 
19/wsj_1956:National Patent Development Corp. said it plans to purchase as many as 200,000 common shares of its 81%-controlled Interferon Sciences Inc. unit in periodic, open-market purchases. 
19/wsj_1956:The 200,000 shares are about 23% of Interferon's common shares outstanding, excluding National Patent's stake. 
19/wsj_1956:Noting the recent Food and Drug Administration approval of Interferon's genital warts treatment, National Patent said it believes Interferon's stock is undervalued. 
19/wsj_1957:Japanese investors, reassured by Monday's strong rally on Wall Street, erased most of that day's losses on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
19/wsj_1957:Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 stocks jumped 527.39 points to close at 34996.08.
19/wsj_1957:On Tuesday, the broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index of issues listed in the first section, which fell 45.66 Monday, rose 41.76, or 1.61%, to 2642.64.
19/wsj_1957:There's no huge buying," said Stephen Hill, head of equity sales at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. in Tokyo. "Really brave views right now would be foolhardy." 
19/wsj_1957:They also are concerned about the persistent strength of the dollar against the yen, as a weaker yen leads to higher import prices in Japan and adds to domestic inflationary pressures. 
19/wsj_1957:Currency concerns also weigh heavily on interest rate-sensitive stocks such as banking and other financial issues because of fears that Japanese interest rates might have to rise to keep the dollar in check. 
19/wsj_1957:It was down more than 40 points a half-hour before the close, marking a 61.5-point turnaround from its high, reached in the first 15 minutes of trading.
19/wsj_1957:Prices opened strongly on the basis of Monday's Wall Street rally and yesterday's gains in Tokyo.
19/wsj_1957:The unexpectedly wide U.S. August trade deficit of $10.77 billion hit an already jittery U.K. market in midafternoon. 
19/wsj_1957:Dealers said London showed signs of calming in midafternoon after Wall Street avoided sharp losses despite the trade report, but a wave of futures-related selling later in the session sent buyers back to the sidelines.
19/wsj_1957:S.G. Warburg, a rumored target of some European banking concerns, finished 22 higher at 400.
19/wsj_1957:Brewery stocks were firm to higher on talk of early bargain-hunting, but most ended below their peaks.
19/wsj_1957:Dealers said there was late talk of a Whitbread sale of brewing operations to Scottish & Newcastle. 
19/wsj_1957:British Gas finished at 197, down 2, on 13 million shares, British Petroleum fell 8 to 291 on 9.4 million shares, and British Telecom was 4 lower at 261 on turnover of 10 million shares.
19/wsj_1957:Paris closed lower, and most Brussels shares were unable to trade for a second consecutive day because of technical problems.
19/wsj_1957:In Hong Kong, Sydney and Singapore -- the largest of those exchanges -- stocks recovered one-third to one-half of the ground they lost in Monday's plunge, with major market indexes posting gains of 3.6% to 4.4%. 
19/wsj_1957:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
19/wsj_1958:Zurn Industries Inc. said it received approval to proceed on four separate projects with a total contract value of $59 million. 
19/wsj_1958:The projects include construction of a 29,400 kilowatt waste-to-energy plant for Ada Cogeneration L.P., Ada, Mich.; a steam generating plant at Ontario, Calif., that Zurn will own and operate, and two waste-water control projects in Orange County, Calif. 
19/wsj_1959:AVX Corp. and Unitrode Corp. said they completed the previously reported sale of Unitrode's San Diego-based Passive Components division to AVX. AVX, a New York-based maker of passive electronic products, paid $11 million in cash to Unitrode, a Lexington-based maker of semiconductor products.
19/wsj_1960:The producer of paper used in magazines and by commercial printers said spending on the expansion is planned to begin in the first quarter of 1990.
19/wsj_1961:THE STOCK of Applied Power Inc., which split 2-for-1 in May, has risen since August 1988.
19/wsj_1962:The stock market's dizzying gyrations during the past few days have made a lot of individual investors wish they could buy some sort of insurance. 
19/wsj_1962:But while they want to be on the alert for similar buying opportunities now, they're afraid of being hammered by another terrifying plunge. 
19/wsj_1962:Because a put option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option's expiration date, the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock's price. 
19/wsj_1962:That's because the cost of buying put options eats into an investor's profit when stock prices rise. 
19/wsj_1962:"This is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby woods are on fire," says Mr. Roth. "You always want your house insured, but you don't always feel the need for your investments to be insured." 
19/wsj_1962:The investor will be out the cost of the put, which is called the "premium," and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit. 
19/wsj_1962:-- If the stock stays at the same price between now and the put's expiration date, the investor's loss will be limited to the cost of the put, less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put.
19/wsj_1962:-- If the price of the stock declines, the put will increase in value.
19/wsj_1962:Once the stock price is less than the exercise price, or "strike price," of the put, the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar.
19/wsj_1962:Though not reflected in the table, an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be partially offset by any dividends that the stock pays. 
19/wsj_1962:For example, Tenneco Inc. pays a quarterly dividend of 76 cents, which would be received before the February option expires and, thus, reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount.
19/wsj_1962:In this case, the investor's risk wouldn't exceed 3.6% of the total investment.
19/wsj_1962:They can do this by purchasing "index puts," which are simply put options on indexes that match broad baskets of stocks.
19/wsj_1962:As a result, the OEX insurance may or may not fully protect an investor's holdings in the event of a market decline. 
19/wsj_1962:So an investor who wanted to realize a profit on OEX puts after the trading suspension would have been out of luck.
19/wsj_1962:On the other hand, only a handful of individual issues were suspended from trading on Friday.
19/wsj_1962:Ultimately, whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is worthwhile depends on the cost of the options.
19/wsj_1962:That cost rises in times of high market volatility.
19/wsj_1962:That's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call.
19/wsj_1962:But if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option, the stock is almost certain to be called away.
19/wsj_1962:These calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock.
19/wsj_1962:All prices are as of Monday's close. 
19/wsj_1963:Hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit-reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the House version in advance of a House-Senate conference broke down. 
19/wsj_1963:But the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues, ranging from cutting the capital-gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic-illness insurance. "Many members feel there are important features of the House bill that should be enacted," Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said. "If there is any support for reducing the bill, it is conditioned on their desire to see them passed in another form." 
19/wsj_1963:White House Budget Director Richard Darman has said he would continue to press to keep the capital-gains provision in the final version of the bill unless the House drops many of its costly provisions. 
19/wsj_1963:Senate leaders had hoped to be able to send a compromise version of the measure to President Bush by the end of the week, but Speaker Foley said that wasn't likely. 
19/wsj_1965:In yesterday's edition, the amount of new capital was misstated. 
19/wsj_1966:McCormick Capital Inc. said its tender offer to buy back as many as 1.1 million, or 44%, of its common shares at $3 apiece, which expired Friday evening, was oversubscribed. 
19/wsj_1966:The developer and manager of futures-investment limited partnerships said preliminary results indicate that about 1,749,000 shares had been tendered, giving a preliminary proration factor of 0.6287.
19/wsj_1967:Northgate Exploration Ltd. said it is proposing to amalgamate four of its associated companies. 
19/wsj_1967:Northgate said it will own about 50% of the equity and 81% of the votes of ABM after the amalgamation. 
19/wsj_1967:The amalgamations are subject to regulatory approval and require approval by shareholders of ABM, Inca, United and Neptune at special meetings on Nov. 10. 
19/wsj_1968:Steven C. Walker, senior vice president of this bank holding company, was named president, chief executive officer and a director of both Commercial National and Commercial National Bank.
19/wsj_1970:The merchandise trade deficit widened in August to $10.77 billion, the Commerce Department reported, a sharp deterioration from July's $8.24 billion and the largest deficit of any month this year.
19/wsj_1970:"This is one of the worst trade releases we've had since the dollar troughed out in 1987," said Geoffrey Dennis, chief international economist at James Capel Inc. Like most analysts, Mr. Dennis was hesitant to read too much into one month's numbers; but he said, "It indicates perhaps that the balance in the U.S. economy is not as good as we've been led to believe." 
19/wsj_1970:"This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline," said Norman Robertson, chief economist for Mellon Bank. "It raises questions about more deep-seated problems, the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability to come to grips with them." 
19/wsj_1970:On Oct. 14 of that year, the announcement of an unusually large August trade deficit helped trigger a steep market decline.
19/wsj_1970:In 1987, however, the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade, while the current report comes after a period of improvement. 
19/wsj_1970:But the figures reinforced the view of many private analysts that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has run out of steam. 
19/wsj_1970:"The figures today add further evidence to support the view that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $110 billion annual rate," said Jeffrey Scott, a research fellow at the Institute for International Economics here. "That's still an improvement over last year, but it leads one to conclude that basically we've gotten all the mileage we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit." 
19/wsj_1970:That's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital, overwhelming the nation's capacity to export. "People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits, but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem," said Mr. Robertson. 
19/wsj_1970:In addition, the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country's competitiveness.
19/wsj_1970:At the same time, William T. Archey, international vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, notes: "Clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more attractive" by causing their prices to decline. 
19/wsj_1970:"The best result we could get from these numbers would be to see the administration and Congress get serious about putting the U.S. on an internationally competitive economic footing," said Howard Lewis, vice president of international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers. "That must start with cutting the federal budget deficit." 
19/wsj_1970:August's decline in exports reflected decreases in sales of industrial supplies, capital goods and food abroad and increases in sales of motor vehicles, parts and engines.
19/wsj_1970:The jump in imports stemmed from across-the-board increases in purchases of foreign goods.

19/wsj_1971:Steve Jobs took a step back from the frontier of personal-computer technology in an effort to spur sales of Next Inc. 's new machine. 
19/wsj_1971:Mr. Jobs moved to remedy a couple of his computer's drawbacks yesterday by lowering the entry-level price for a Next machine by $1,500, or 23%, if the buyer chooses a hard-disk drive as an alternative to Next's optical-storage device.
19/wsj_1971:The hard drive, which is the storage device of choice for virtually every desktop computer user, also now will supplement Next's futuristic optical device if buyers pay full price. 
19/wsj_1971:Mr. Jobs, co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., founded Next four years ago in the hopes of fomenting a revolution in the way desktop computers are designed and used.
19/wsj_1971:But the computer was proving a hard sell because of its high price, a lack of software and an optical data-storage device that was too slow. 
19/wsj_1971:The machine began shipping at the end of last year.
19/wsj_1971:Mr. Jobs said the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device, which isn't offered as standard equipment by any rivals.
19/wsj_1971:Optical-storage devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to edit film clips or audio recordings with a computer.
19/wsj_1971:Next's decision to rely on the more-established hard drive in every Next computer doesn't signal a retreat from optical storage, said Mr. Jobs, who for years has said this technology will play a crucial role in the next decade. "We're extremely committed to optical storage technology" he said. "We think everything will go this way in a few years." He said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives, but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices. 
19/wsj_1971:But university computer specialists, who welcomed the move, called it a necessary retreat from the cutting edge of technology and one that's likely to increase Next's sales on campuses. 
19/wsj_1971:"From the standpoint of being on the forefront of technology, this is a step backward," said Jerry W. Sprecher, a senior computing manager for the California state university system. "But it will definitely boost Next's sales." 
19/wsj_1971:Universities, however, say Next's prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine. "We'd still like to see a student model," priced at about $3,500, said Ronald Johnson, director of academic computing at Minnesota's Gustavus Adolphus College, which has bought eight Next machines. 
19/wsj_1971:Broad acceptance of Next's computer also is hindered by difficulty in distributing software for it.
19/wsj_1971:He said he expects Lotus Development Corp. to introduce a Next version of its popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program in 1990. 
19/wsj_1971:Educators added that Next needs to soon offer a color version of its computer.
19/wsj_1972:Donald J. Amaral, 37 years old, was named president and chief operating officer of this owner and operator of hospitals, nursing centers and retirement hotels.
19/wsj_1972:The position of chief operating officer is new. 
19/wsj_1973:Ashton-Tate Corp. reported a net loss of $19.4 million, or 74 cents a share, for the third quarter, which was burdened by severance costs and the expense of upgrading its database software inventories. 
19/wsj_1973:This contrasts with the year-ago quarter, when the company had net income of $11.7 million, or 45 cents a share, on revenue of $75.7 million. 
19/wsj_1973:For the nine months, Ashton-Tate had a loss of $27.6 million, or $1.05 a share.
19/wsj_1973:In the year-ago period, the company had profit of $34.3 million, or $1.32 a share.
19/wsj_1973:Edward M. Esber, chairman, president and chief executive officer, attributed the decline to reduced domestic revenue because of $4.9 million spent to upgrade existing software inventories to the new database IV Version 1.1, and $1.8 million spent on the recent reduction in work force.
19/wsj_1973:The red ink came as no surprise to Wall Street, but analysts said they saw ominous hints of a further delay in volume shipments of Version 1.1, a harbinger of continued losses in the fourth quarter. 
19/wsj_1973:He added gross margins and operating profit "eroded quite dramatically" from the prior quarter, along with sales of existing software product lines like Multimate and Framework. 
19/wsj_1973:"The success of a new product in the database line is needed.
19/wsj_1973:"It now looks like database IV Version 1.1 isn't going to be {widely} available until the first quarter of 1990," said David Bayer, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "This is the second delay now in getting the product out the door.
19/wsj_1973:Mr. Maxwell said unless the company can start shipments of the new product sometime this quarter, the fourth-quarter loss is likely to be "comparable to the third quarter's." If the company can start to ship during this quarter, it could stem some, if not all of the red ink, he said. 
19/wsj_1974:Reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $1 million or more.
19/wsj_1974:COMMERCIAL PAPER: High-grade unsecured notes sold through dealers by major corporations in multiples of $1,000: 8.50% 30 days; 8.40% 60 days; 8.375% 90 days. 
19/wsj_1974:CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT: 8.05% one month; 8.02% two months; 8% three months; 7.98% six months; 7.95% one year.
19/wsj_1974:Average of top rates paid by major New York banks on primary new issues of negotiable C.D.s, usually on amounts of $1 million and more.
19/wsj_1974:The average of interbank offered rates for dollar deposits in the London market based on quotations at five major banks. 
19/wsj_1974:TREASURY BILLS: Results of the Monday, October 16, 1989, auction of short-term U.S. government bills, sold at a discount from face value in units of $10,000 to $1 million: 7.37% 13 weeks; 7.42% 26 weeks. 
19/wsj_1974:Annualized average rate of return after expenses for the past 30 days; not a forecast of future returns. 
19/wsj_1975:Net in the latest period included $11.9 million from discontinued operations and a charge of $6.2 million from a plant closing.
19/wsj_1977:Enserch Corp. said about 12 million, or 93%, of the publicly traded units of its limited partnership, Enserch Exploration Partners Ltd., were tendered in response to an offer that expired Monday. 
19/wsj_1977:Enserch said the tendered units will raise its ownership of the partnership to more than 99% from 87%.
19/wsj_1977:Enserch had offered one-half a share of its common and $1 in cash for each unit. 
19/wsj_1978:The public sector borrowing requirement, the most widely used measure of Britain's government deficit or surplus, showed a deficit of #200 million in September, compared with a deficit of #765 million in August and a deficit of #1.08 billion in September 1988, the Treasury said. 
19/wsj_1978:In the six months since the current fiscal year began April 1, the surplus totaled #500 million, compared with a surplus of #3.6 billion in the year-earlier period. 
19/wsj_1978:The reported figures for the public sector borrowing requirement include receipts from the sale of state-owned industries.
19/wsj_1980:Prospect Group Inc., whose recent hostile tender offer for Recognition Equipment Inc. failed for lack of financing, apparently has gained a measure of control over the troubled company anyway. 
19/wsj_1980:As part of what a Recognition spokeswoman termed an "amiable agreement," Prospect Group will wind up with control of top management posts and an increased stake in the maker of data management equipment. 
19/wsj_1980:Mr. Hurley was formerly a vice president and general manager of an Avery International division; Mr. Vanourek was a former group vice president of Pitney Bowes Inc. 
19/wsj_1980:In addition, the agreement calls for Gilbert H. Lamphere, chairman of Prospect Group's executive committee, to be named chairman of a restructured board that will include four new independent directors.
19/wsj_1980:Prospect, a New York-based leveraged buy-out firm, also agreed to invest $15 million in Recognition, which in turn agreed to repurchase as much as $20 million of its stock.
19/wsj_1980:That would increase Prospect's ownership of the company's fully-diluted shares outstanding to 20% from 14.1%.
19/wsj_1980:Recognition also said it obtained a commitment from Chemical Bank and Bank of Boston to convert an estimated $18 million in bank debt to a new, 24-month secured term loan to be repaid through the sale of certain assets. 
19/wsj_1980:In August, Recognition said it was in violation of certain terms of its debt agreements with bank lenders because of a $3.9 million loss for the third quarter ended July 31.
19/wsj_1980:The former executives were indicted last October on charges of fraud, theft and conspiracy related to efforts by the company to win $400 million in Postal Service contracts. 
19/wsj_1980:Recognition Equipment said it expected to put the agreement with Prospect to a vote of its stockholders at a special meeting in January. 
19/wsj_1981:General Motors Corp. 's Chevrolet division, reacting to slow sales, said it will offer $800 rebates on its 1990 Beretta, the two-door version of its core compact-car line. 
19/wsj_1981:Sluggish sales of the Beretta, and its four-door sister car, the Corsica, prompted GM to idle the two plants that build the automobiles for a total of three weeks this month.
19/wsj_1981:The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest-volume car line at Chevrolet, but sales of the vehicles are off 9.6% for the year, and fell a steep 34% during early October. 
19/wsj_1982:StatesWest Airlines said it submitted an offer to the directors of Mesa Airlines to acquire the Farmington, N.M., carrier. 
19/wsj_1982:Except to characterize its offer as "fair and generous and in the best interests of Mesa shareholders," StatesWest declined to discuss details of its proposal.
19/wsj_1982:A Mesa official confirmed receipt of the offer and said directors would meet to consider it. 
19/wsj_1983:The former president of FirstSouth F.A., a defunct Arkansas thrift, pleaded guilty to conspiring to inflate the institution's earnings by concealing worthless loan guarantees. 
19/wsj_1983:Roderick D. Reed III, who was also chief operating officer of FirstSouth, could receive a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.
19/wsj_1983:Mr. Reed admitted he conspired to conceal an agreement not to enforce loan guarantees executed by Dallas real-estate developers A. Starke Taylor III and George S. Watson, both of whom were FirstSouth stockholders.
19/wsj_1983:The conspiracy was part of an effort by Mr. Reed to hide FirstSouth's shaky financial condition from federal regulators, according to federal prosecutors and regulators.
19/wsj_1983:Mr. Weichern is scheduled for trial Jan. 3 before federal Judge Stephen Reasoner of Little Rock. 
19/wsj_1984:I had underestimated, however, both Mr. Gelbart's wit and the persistence of scandal in Washington.
19/wsj_1984:Though the play clearly is framed around the events of Iran-Contra, it takes in the wide sweep of scandals over the past 30 years.
19/wsj_1984:In fact, at one point Merry Chase (Melinda Mullins), a cool, carefully coiffed television announcer, recites a list of a dozen or more scandals of recent years, concluding with those affecting the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the savings and loan industry. 
19/wsj_1984:Onstage, a congressional hearing is in progress, complete with elegant crystal chandelier overhead and a lifesize reproduction of the signing of the Constitution in the background.
19/wsj_1984:The metaphor of theater is not entirely coincidental.
19/wsj_1984:As the story of "Mastergate" unfolds, we learn that the Internal Revenue Service confiscated one of the properties of a foreign financier who owes the government millions in taxes.
19/wsj_1984:He himself lives in a "consecutive series of unnumbered houses in a town in Switzerland." The property seized by the IRS is a Hollywood film studio, Master Pictures Incorporated (MPI).
19/wsj_1984:Supposedly the IRS will sell off the assets of MPI, but before it can, a lowly IRS agent is called into the hospital room of Wylie Slaughter, the dying head of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
19/wsj_1984:Soon the studio is producing a $40 million picture called "Tet, the Motion Picture," to distinguish it from "Tet, the Offensive," as well as "Tet, the Book" and "Tet, the Album." The picture, to be made in the Central American country of San Elvador, is a cover for sending $800 million of arms to Los Otros, the rebel group attempting to regain neighboring Ambigua, which has been taken over by the leftist dictator Dr. Overtega, a former podiatrist, who leads a revolutionary band of foot soldiers.
19/wsj_1984:Director Michael Engler has assembled a top-flight cast to carry out the impersonations of well-known political figures and to play the stock characters who invariably show up at congressional hearings.
19/wsj_1984:Daniel von Bargen is ramrod-stiff but totally assured as Major Battle, mixing just the right brand of self-righteousness and patriotism; Jeff Weiss is fire, brimstone and teary-eyed emotionalism as the far-right senator who serves as a friendly interrogator of Major Battle; Zach Grenier is maddeningly officious playing a succession of lawyers; Joseph Daly has the perfect "aw, shucks" demeanor of George Bush in his portrayal of the vice president; and Ann McDonough is first-rate as a succession of witnesses' wives.
19/wsj_1984:Though it's clear that Mr. Gelbart's sympathies do not lie with the far right, it's also true that he is evenhanded in dispensing his satirical jabs, taking sharp aim at senators and congressmen of all stripes and particularly at the media.
19/wsj_1984:He describes a Mastergate flunky as one who experienced a "meteoric disappearance" and found himself "handling blanket appeals at the Bureau of Indian Affairs." 
19/wsj_1984:Mr. Gelbart deplores the obfuscation, the circumlocution and the debasement of language he sees on all sides.
19/wsj_1984:As the hearings begin, the self-important Sen. Bowman (Jerome Kilty) announces: "Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset: We are not looking for hides to skin nor goats to scape." Major Battle himself speaks in pure Pentagonese: "Without further monetary-stroke-military aid, scores of Ambiguan freedom lovers, who had gone way out on their life and limbs for us, were literally cut off at the knees without a paddle." At another point he intones: "Publicity is a small price to pay for secrecy." 
19/wsj_1984:The evening is short -- 95 minutes without an intermission -- but even so, as the play progresses the thrust of Mr. Gelbart's satire loses its sharpness as his targets pop up ever more predictably.
19/wsj_1984:Most of the evening, though, is filled with rare and welcome wit.
19/wsj_1984:In "Mastergate," Mr. Gelbart has provided us not just one but two commodities that have all but disappeared from the Broadway theater: sharp political satire and an even sharper appreciation of the value of language. 
19/wsj_1985:The Federal National Mortgage Association set up a three-member office of the chairman and elected James A. Johnson as vice chairman, effective Jan. 1. 
19/wsj_1985:Mr. Johnson has been a managing director at Shearson Lehman Hutton since 1985, and before that was president of Public Strategies, a Washington consulting firm.
19/wsj_1985:He is well-known in Democratic circles, having been executive assistant to Vice President Walter Mondale and chairman of Mr. Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign. 
19/wsj_1985:In an interview, he said Fannie Mae faces a number of challenges with the restructuring of the thrift industry and the push to broaden its activities overseas. "There's no shortage of major things to do," he said. 
19/wsj_1985:Fannie Mae also said James A. Aliber, chairman of First Federal of Michigan and a director since 1985, moved up the date of his retirement from the board to accommodate Mr. Johnson's election as a director.
19/wsj_1986:"The New Crowd" by Judith Ramsey Ehrlich and Barry J. Rehfeld (Little, Brown, 444 pages, $19.95), describes the displacing of the old "our crowd" Jewish Wall Street banking grandees by such new business barons as Saul Steinberg, Carl Icahn, Sanford Weill and Bruce Wasserstein.
19/wsj_1986:These two New Crowd families lived in the same apartment building, with the Postel penthouse perched on top of the Gutfreund duplex.
19/wsj_1986:Then the Gutfreunds determined to put up a 22-foot Christmas tree, weighing a quarter of a ton, to amaze their holiday guests.
19/wsj_1986:Before the Gutfreunds finally left this unfriendly environment for a prodigious duplex on Fifth Avenue and an 18th-century mansion with a specially excavated $1 million garage in Paris, the Postels had obtained an injunction to prevent any future hoisting of trees, and in a neighborly spirit hit both the Gutfreunds and the building with a $35 million lawsuit.
19/wsj_1986:The young John Gutfreund had been discovered by Billy Salomon of Salomon Bros. when he was still a bearded liberal, and put to work as a trader, and then as a rough-and-tumble syndicator. " `Get off your . . .,' he would bellow," say the authors.
19/wsj_1986:After he had been head of the company for 3 1/2 years, he and his partners sold it to Phibro, a powerful commodity trading outfit, for $550 million in Phibro stock.
19/wsj_1986:The book also recounts the not dissimilar maneuvers surrounding the changing of the guard at Lehman Bros. and other grand old firms.
19/wsj_1986:Often the genteel, conservative, long-term-oriented investment bankers were displaced by crude traders: "When angered, he cursed so forcefully that his face reddened and his pale-blue eyes narrowed into tiny slits," the authors say of Lehman's Lewis Glucksman. 
19/wsj_1986:The earlier generation of "our crowd" bankers -- Belmonts, Warburgs, Lehmans, Baches and Schiffs -- had stressed above all probity, tradition, continuity and reputation.
19/wsj_1986:They were old-fashioned elegant gentlemen, who happened to be of German Jewish extraction.
19/wsj_1986:But in the harsh world of today's Wall Street they have lost out to more aggressive and sometimes less scrupulous successors.
19/wsj_1986:The cuckoo prefers the nests of other birds and heaves out their eggs.
19/wsj_1986:The old guard had every right, however, to disdain the newcomers' new ways of making money, such as greenmail. (A Fortune article on Saul Steinberg was entitled, "Fear and Loathing in the Corporate Boardrooms.") Their other staple has been corporate takeovers, often hostile and financed by junk bonds.
19/wsj_1986:First, by making management focus on short-term results, they inhibit building for the future -- just the opposite of Japan.
19/wsj_1986:Second, a long-term shareholder of a good company needn't worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily: It will bounce back.
19/wsj_1986:It has been rightly observed that the main thing wrong with tainted money is, t'aint enough of it. 
19/wsj_1986:A handful of the New Crowd operators have crossed the line from the immoral to the illegal, and have ended up in the slammer or paying huge fines: Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine, Martin Siegel, Victor and Steven Posner, and now Michael Milken and perhaps Leona Helmsley.
19/wsj_1986:The glitzy office that Ivan Boesky vacated for a prison cell had previously contained commodity operators Marc Rich and "Pinky" Green, today fugitives from a potential century apiece of jail sentences. 
19/wsj_1986:Some pretty seamy stuff built the turn-of-the-century families' Fifth Avenue and Newport palazzi and endowed their daughters' weddings to foreign noblemen.
19/wsj_1986:Mr. Boesky was a piker compared to Jay Gould and Jim Fiske, and Commodore Vanderbilt thought nothing of bribing judges and legislators.
19/wsj_1986:In a generation or two some of the New Crowd may attain true respectability, perhaps to be displaced in turn by a later flock of unscrupulous raptors.
19/wsj_1986:Mr. Train is president of Train, Smith Investment Counsel, New York. 
19/wsj_1987:Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons said he raised his stake in Lockheed Corp. to 10.62% from 10.43% of the aerospace and electronics concern's common shares. 
19/wsj_1987:In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Simmons said he and companies he controls, NL Industries Inc. and NL Chemicals Inc., hold 6,744,600 shares of Lockheed, of Calabasas, Calif.
19/wsj_1987:Valhi Inc., another of Mr. Simmons' companies, responded to an article Monday in The Wall Street Journal, which credited a story in the Sunday Los Angeles Daily News.
19/wsj_1987:Instead, Valhi said, they may increase, decrease or retain their Lockheed holdings, depending on a number of conditions. 
19/wsj_1988:The U.S. and Canada, which do more trade than any other pair of nations, are to meet next month to arrange an acceleration of planned tariff cuts under the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement. 
19/wsj_1988:Industries in both countries have requested a speedup of tariff cuts on hundreds of products.
19/wsj_1988:The two countries aim to reach an agreement by early December on a package of accelerated tariff cuts that would take effect early next year. 
19/wsj_1988:Participants in the U.S. missions to Canada are to be assisted by members of the Service Corps of Retired Executives, a volunteer group, in dealing with their export challenges. 
19/wsj_1988:The Canadian government also has recently opened new trade offices in San Diego; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Miami; Princeton, N.J., and Denver, bringing the total number of such Canadian offices in the U.S. to 27.
19/wsj_1988:Canada's export effort has been blunted by robust home market demand and by an 18% appreciation of the Canadian dollar against its U.S. counterpart in the past three years that has made Canadian goods more costly in the U.S. 
19/wsj_1989:Loral Corp. said it received a $325 million order from Turkey's Ministry of Defense, the largest contract the company ever has received. 
19/wsj_1989:Loral will provide to Turkey an electronic countermeasures system for its fleet of F-16 aircraft.
19/wsj_1990:Under the proposed agreement, Gold Texas holders will receive 1.43 Crown shares for each of the 1.1 million Gold Texas shares not owned by Crown, which already owns 65%. 
19/wsj_1990:The arrangement is subject to approval by the Supreme Court of British Columbia province, Crown said.
19/wsj_1991:Apogee Robotics Inc. said its board extended until Feb. 1 the exercise period of Apogee's existing stock purchase warrants outstanding.
19/wsj_1991:Each of the 1,075,000 warrants entitle the holders to purchase one share of Apogee common stock for $2.25.
19/wsj_1992:Bank of New England Corp., seeking to streamline its business after a year of weak earnings and mounting loan problems, said it will sell some operations and lay off 4% of its work force. 
19/wsj_1992:Among its restructuring measures, the company said it plans to sell 53 of its 453 branch offices and to lay off 800 employees.
19/wsj_1992:Altogether, employment is expected to decline to less than 16,000 from the current level of about 18,000. 
19/wsj_1992:Walter Connolly, chairman, said in an interview that the company expects to record pretax gains of $100 million to $125 million from the sale of its leasing operations and of certain financial processing services.
19/wsj_1992:Nonperforming assets continued to pile up in the latest quarter, rising to $900 million, or 3.52% of loans and leases, from $667 million, or 2.68%, at the end of the second quarter.
19/wsj_1992:Some $170 million of the $233 million increase in nonperforming loans was related to real estate, and roughly three-quarters of that was in the troubled New England market, according to Richard Driscoll, vice chairman. 
19/wsj_1992:Mr. Driscoll said that, despite continued weakness in the region's real estate market, Bank of New England expects the rate of increase in nonperforming assets to slow in coming quarters.
19/wsj_1992:And he indicated that more substantial improvement is expected in the next couple of quarters. 
19/wsj_1992:The company increased its loan loss reserve to $354 million from $342 million at the end of the second quarter.
19/wsj_1992:Total assets slipped to $31.4 billion, from $32 billion as of June 30. 
19/wsj_1992:Connolly and Driscoll described the restructuring as an effort to continue rationalizing operations assembled during a series of mergers over the past five years. 
19/wsj_1993:The index has a base of 100 set in 1980 and isn't seasonally adjusted. 
19/wsj_1994:The trade group's compilation of Commerce Department data showed that August imports, the second largest monthly total of the year, were up 5% from July's 1,458,000 tons but below last year's high of 1,979,000 tons in June 1988. 
19/wsj_1994:August imports claimed 18.5% of the U.S. market, compared with 19.3% in July and 20.5% in August 1988.
19/wsj_1994:The latest month's figures show that imports of steel from European Community nations fell to 466,000 tons from 481,000 a month earlier, while imports from Japan rose to 323,000 tons from 288,000 in July.
19/wsj_1994:The American Institute for Imported Steel said imports for the first eight months of 1989 were below the level allowed by the Voluntary Restraint Agreement program.
19/wsj_1994:The institute said that, excluding semifinished steel products, year-to-date imports represented 15.2% of consumption, compared with a permitted maximum of 18.5%. 
19/wsj_1996:How soon Wang will stage a comeback, or if it will at all, are still matters of debate.
19/wsj_1996:But Wang salespeople are trying to cope with the biggest challenge any marketer can face: selling the products of a company that is on the ropes. 
19/wsj_1996:Consider the difficulties faced by Audi salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration, or Exxon dealers' problems in the wake of the Valdez oil spill. 
19/wsj_1996:Like thousands of salespeople before them, Wang's are finding ways to combat the bad news. "It's very important that we exude confidence, even though within the family we know there's a lot of hard work ahead," said Richard Miller, the Lowell, Mass., computer concern's new president, in a video message to salespeople a month after he took over. 
19/wsj_1996:Wang got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts.
19/wsj_1996:Last year it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing, and it suffered huge losses when sales turned down instead of rising. 
19/wsj_1996:Salespeople try to push their products and avoid discussions of finances.
19/wsj_1996:Responding to such questions is "defensive," says Kenneth Olissa, Wang's vice president, marketing. "That's antithetical to the art of selling." Moreover, he notes that analyzing financial results "poses a problem for a salesman who isn't particularly familiar with a balance sheet." 
19/wsj_1996:Mike Metschan, a salesman in Wang's Austin, Texas, office, has a breezier method: "We tell them $3 billion companies don't go out of business.
19/wsj_1996:Experts on sales technique say anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line. "If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble, it will be a problem for the long run," says George Palmatier, a Minden, Nev., sales consultant and author of "The Marketing Edge." 
19/wsj_1996:Still, says John Sullivan, a management recruiter with Daniel Roberts Inc. of Boston, who has held senior sales positions at Polaroid and Atari: "The customer will react to strength.
19/wsj_1996:For buyers, "these are career-risking decisions," says Jean Conlin, who supervises a network of Wang computers in the admissions department at Boston University.
19/wsj_1996:But "their present financial condition means I'd have a hard time convincing the vice president in charge of purchasing." 
19/wsj_1996:Wang's overall product line is "still not as good as other vendors, but they've come a long way," says Steven Wendler, a consultant with market researcher Gartner Group, Stamford, Conn. "They were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until this bad quarter happened." 
19/wsj_1996:Wang's installed base is one of its greatest assets, and many of those customers remain extremely loyal. 
19/wsj_1996:New customers, the source of higher commissions for salespeople and the key to Wang's long-term viability, are even tougher.
19/wsj_1996:But salespeople often found that news of Wang's problems superseded their sales efforts.
19/wsj_1996:He is now president of Eastate Homes Inc., an Indianapolis contractor. 
19/wsj_1996:It can be hard for a salesperson to fight off feelings of discouragement.
19/wsj_1996:Paul Hellman, a Framingham, Mass., sales and management consultant and author of "Ready, Aim, You're Hired," says: "The bad news is, you'll be rejected more.
19/wsj_1997:Blinder International Enterprises Inc., the parent of beleaguered penny-stockbroker Blinder, Robinson & Co., said its shareholders approved a previously announced name change to Intercontinental Enterprises Inc. 
19/wsj_1998:Olin Corp. said third-quarter net income rose 26% on the strength of its chemical business. 
19/wsj_1998:Olin said its chemical segment had profit of $22 million, up from $15 million a year ago, largely because of gains in electrochemicals such as caustic soda.
19/wsj_1998:The chemical segment had a $6 million gain on the sale of ammonia and urea businesses, which was offset by a $6 million charge for future environmental expenditures.
19/wsj_1999:The company said the quarter included a 10% increase in local-exchange usage for long-distance calling and a 5% increase in the number of access lines in service.
19/wsj_1999:Earlier rate reductions in Texas and California reduced the quarter's revenue and operating profit $55 million; a year earlier, operating profit in telephone operations was reduced by a similar amount as a result of a provision for a reorganization. 
19/wsj_1999:Revenue in the telecommunications products and services unit rose 27% to $728.8 million, but operating profit was unchanged at $26.3 million, partly because of start-up expenses.
19/wsj_1999:Electrical products' sales fell to $496.7 million from $504.5 million with higher world-wide lighting volume offset by lower domestic prices and the impact of weaker currencies in Europe and South America.
19/wsj_1999:Operating profit of $37.2 million was unchanged. 
19/wsj_1999:MCI claims about 12% of the overall long-distance telephone market but just under 10% of the $23 billion residential market.
19/wsj_1999:It has been trying to improve its share of the residential market.
19/wsj_1999:The company wants its business mix to more closely match that of AT&T -- a step it says will help prevent cross subsidization. 
19/wsj_1999:Southwestern Bell Corp. said net dropped 8.7%, mainly the result of four extraordinary items: a franchise tax refund that its Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. unit received last year; a production shift of several Yellow Pages directories to the fourth quarter from the third; a rate refund in Missouri and a one-time adjustment to phone company revenues. 
19/wsj_1999:The company reported a 3.1% increase in the number of access lines in service, and also said its Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems unit added 30,000 new customers, with a current total of about 333,000. 
19/wsj_1999:The company noted that the year-ago period was particularly strong, with an increase of nearly 70%.
19/wsj_1999:The company said that the number of access lines dropped slightly in the quarter, a decline attributed to seasonal fluctuations.
19/wsj_1999:Chairman D.H. Hibbard said the company has set a new five year goal of doubling revenues to about $1.8 billion while steadily increasing net. 
20/wsj_2000:Under the existing contract, Rockwell said, it has already delivered 793 of the shipsets to Boeing.
20/wsj_2001:Frank Carlucci III was named to this telecommunications company's board, filling the vacancy created by the death of William Sobey last May.
20/wsj_2001:In January, he accepted the position of vice chairman of Carlyle Group, a merchant banking concern. 
20/wsj_2002:SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON Inc. Thomas E. Meador, 42 years old, was named president and chief operating officer of Balcor Co., a Skokie, Ill., subsidiary of this New York investment banking firm.
20/wsj_2002:Mr. Meador had been executive vice president of Balcor.
20/wsj_2003:Great American Bank, citing depressed Arizona real estate prices, posted a third-quarter loss of $59.4 million, or $2.48 a share. 
20/wsj_2003:A year earlier, the savings bank had earnings of $8.1 million, or 33 cents a share.
20/wsj_2003:For the nine months, it had a loss of $58.3 million, or $2.44 a share, after earnings of $29.5 million, or $1.20 a share, in the 1988 period. 
20/wsj_2003:Before the loan-loss addition, it said, it had operating profit of $10 million for the quarter.
20/wsj_2003:The move followed a round of similar increases by other lenders against Arizona real estate loans, reflecting a continuing decline in that market. 
20/wsj_2003:In addition to the increased reserve, the savings bank took a special charge of $5 million representing general and administrative expenses from staff reductions and other matters, and it posted a $7.6 million reduction in expected mortgage servicing fees, reflecting the fact that more borrowers are prepaying their mortgages. 
20/wsj_2004:Arbitragers weren't the only big losers in the collapse of UAL Corp. stock.
20/wsj_2004:Wolf and Pope saw their prospective personal fortunes continue to plummet as shares of UAL, United's parent company, dived $24.875 on the Big Board to close at $198. 
20/wsj_2004:Including Monday's plunge, that has given the two executives paper losses of $49.5 million, based on what they would have realized had the pilots and management-led buy-out of UAL gone through at $300 a share. 
20/wsj_2004:By yesterday's close of trading, it was good for a paltry $43.5 million. 
20/wsj_2004:Of course, Mr. Wolf, 48 years old, has some savings.
20/wsj_2004:He left his last two jobs at Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger with combined stock-option gains of about $22 million, and UAL gave him a $15 million bonus when it hired him.
20/wsj_2004:The 40-year old Mr. Pope hasn't changed jobs enough -- at least the right ones -- to stash away that kind of money.
20/wsj_2004:United paid him a $375,000 bonus to lure him away from American Airlines, and he was paid a salary of $342,122 last year with a $280,000 bonus. 
20/wsj_2004:Of the combined $114.4 million the two men were scheduled to reap under the buy-out, they agreed to invest in the buy-out just $15 million, angering many of the thousands of workers asked to make pay concessions so the buy-out would be a success. 
20/wsj_2005:Thomas H. Johnson, president of the Coatedboard division of Mead Corp., was named president of Manville Forest Products Corp., a Manville unit, and senior vice president of Manville Corp. Mr. Johnson succeeds Harry W. Sherman, who resigned to pursue other interests, in both positions.
20/wsj_2006:US Facilities Corp. said Robert J. Percival agreed to step down as vice chairman of the insurance holding company. 
20/wsj_2006:"There was a difference of opinion as to the future direction of the company," a spokeswoman said.
20/wsj_2006:In the same statement, US Facilities also said it had bought back 112,000 of its common shares in a private transaction.
20/wsj_2006:The buy-back represents about 3% of the company's shares, based on the 3.7 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30. 
20/wsj_2007:Three leading drug companies reported robust third-quarter earnings, bolstered by strong sales of newer, big-selling prescriptions drugs that provide hefty profit margins. 
20/wsj_2007:International sales accounted for 47% of total company sales for the nine months, compared with 50% a year earlier.
20/wsj_2007:Intense competition, however, led to unit sales declines for a group of Merck's established human and animal-health products, including Aldomet and Indocin. 
20/wsj_2007:Warner-Lambert, Morris Plains, N.J., reported sales that were a record for any quarter and the eighth quarter in a row of 20% or more per-share earnings growth.
20/wsj_2007:Spurred by growth in world-wide sales of the company's prescription drugs, Warner-Lambert said 1989 will be the best year in its history, with per-share earnings expected to increase more than 20% to about $6.10.
20/wsj_2007:The segment's growth was led by sales of the cardiovascular drugs Lopid, a lipid regulator, and Dilzem, a calcium channel blocker. 
20/wsj_2007:World-wide sales of Warner-Lambert's non-prescription health-care products, such as Halls cough tablets, Rolaids antacid, and Lubriderm skin lotion, increased 3% to $362 million in the third quarter; U.S. sales rose 5%. 
20/wsj_2007:World-wide sales of Trident gum, Certs breath mints, and Clorets gum and breath mints, increased 12% to $277 million. 
20/wsj_2007:Earnings continued to pace sales because of a lower tax rate, profit from the renegotiation of the debt instrument received from Faberge Inc. in connection with Lilly's sale of Elizabeth Arden Inc. in 1987, and net proceeds from the settlement of patent litigation at Lilly's Hybritech Inc. unit. 
20/wsj_2007:Third-quarter sales of the Indianapolis, Ind., company rose 11% to $1.045 billion from $940.6 million.
20/wsj_2007:Sales of Prozac, an anti-depressant, led drug-sales increases.
20/wsj_2007:Higher sales of pesticides and other plant-science products more than offset a slight decline in the sales of animal-health products to fuel the increase in world-wide agricultural product sales, Lilly said. 
20/wsj_2008:Reuben Mark, chairman of Colgate-Palmolive Co., said he is "comfortable" with analysts' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to between 95 cents and $1.05 a share.
20/wsj_2008:That compares with per-share earnings from continuing operations of 69 cents the year earlier; including discontinued operations, per-share was 88 cents a year ago. 
20/wsj_2008:He said the improvement was a result of cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations, blending two sales organizations and focusing more carefully the company's promotional activities. 
20/wsj_2008:Analysts estimate Colgate's sales of household products in the U.S. were flat for the quarter, and they estimated operating margins at only 1% to 3%. "If you could say their business in the U.S. was mediocre, but great everywhere else, that would be fine," says Bonita Austin, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co. "But it's not mediocre, it's a real problem." 
20/wsj_2008:Mr. Mark conceded that Colgate's domestic business, apart from its highly profitable Hill's Pet Products unit, has lagged. "We've done a lot to improve {U.S.} results, and a lot more will be done," Mr. Mark said. "Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company." 
20/wsj_2009:H. Anthony Ittleson was elected a director of this company, which primarily has interests in radio and television stations, increasing the number of seats to five.
20/wsj_2010:Ray" Berry, yesterday poured ridicule on new drawings of Globe columnists that replaced old photos in the revamped pages this week.
20/wsj_2010:By late last night, Globe Managing Editor Thomas Mulvoy, bending to the will of his troops, scrapped the new drawings.
20/wsj_2010:For a few days at least, he says, no pictures or drawings of any kind will adorn the columns. 
20/wsj_2010:Globe columnist Mike Barnicle -- in the second attack on his employer in as many weeks -- averred that his shadowy countenance was so bad, it looked "like a face you'd find on a bottle of miracle elixir that promises to do away with diarrhea in our lifetime." Mr. Barnicle reminded readers that he still hasn't forgiven Globe management for questioning a $20 expense chit he submitted for parking his car while chasing a story. 
20/wsj_2010:Mr. Barnicle was hardly kinder to the renderings of colleagues Michael Madden ("appears to be a pervert"), Will McDonough ("looks as if he drove for Abe Lincoln") or Bella English, whose "little girl now screams hysterically every time she sees a newspaper." 
20/wsj_2010:Lynn Staley, the Globe's assistant managing editor for design, acknowledges that the visages were "on the low end of the likeness spectrum." 
20/wsj_2010:Rival Boston Herald columnist Howie Carr, who usually rails at Statehouse "hacks" and nepotism, argued that the new drawings were designed to hide Mr. Madden's "rapidly growing forehead" and the facial defects of "chinless" Dan Shaughnessy, a Globe sports columnist. 
20/wsj_2010:"But think of the money you, the reader, will save on Halloween," said Mr. Barnicle. "Instead of buying masks for your kids, just cut out the columnists' pictures. . . ." 
20/wsj_2011:Deeply ingrained in both the book review "Kissing Nature Good-bye" by Stephen MacDonald (Leisure & Arts, Sept. 27) and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity.
20/wsj_2011:In the absence of humans, would the Earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term? 
20/wsj_2011:Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of North America, northern Europe and Asia.
20/wsj_2011:Furthermore, no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming.
20/wsj_2011:It is probably continuing and may well account for most of, or all of, present-day global warming. 
20/wsj_2011:University of 
20/wsj_2012:In addition, the tax-collecting agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new high-level positions to guide the 120,000-employee agency: a comptroller to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer to update the information system, which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world. 
20/wsj_2012:The IRS also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer, who will be hired from within the agency. 
20/wsj_2012:IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg said the changes are intended to bring "accountability" to the agency, which has an annual budget of more than $5 billion and collects about $1 trillion a year. 
20/wsj_2012:"My assessment and everyone's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget," Mr. Goldberg said. "And we don't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend $5 billion properly." 
20/wsj_2012:Mr. Goldberg, who took over as head of the IRS in July, has been disturbed by what he considers the inefficiency, waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency. 
20/wsj_2012:The new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward enhancing its ability to collect more tax revenue. 
20/wsj_2012:"You're telling someone they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever," Mr. Goldberg said. "On the comptroller side, you're developing and making work financial controls governing a $6 billion budget." 
20/wsj_2013:When Maj. Moises Giroldi, the leader of the abortive coup in Panama, was buried, his body bore several gunshot wounds, a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs.
20/wsj_2013:They were the signature of his adversary, Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
20/wsj_2013:The rebel officer's slow and painful death, at the headquarters of Panama's Battalion-2000 squad, was personally supervised by Gen. Noriega, says a U.S. official with access to intelligence reports.
20/wsj_2013:Leaping into rages, sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust, Mr. Noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup, according to U.S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City. 
20/wsj_2013:And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup-makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters.
20/wsj_2013:America's war on the dictator over the past two years, following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988, is the legacy of that relationship.
20/wsj_2013:Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega, it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama's long history of conspirators and pirates. 
20/wsj_2013:For most of the past 30 years, the marriage was one of convenience.
20/wsj_2013:From that point on, the U.S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian's misadventures. 
20/wsj_2013:The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega isn't as smooth as the shah of Iran, as well-born as Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza, as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti's Baby Doc Duvalier.
20/wsj_2013:Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them.
20/wsj_2013:And out of necessity: The U.S. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power, but a single error on his part could cost him his life. 
20/wsj_2013:"The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along," says Ambler Moss, a former Ambassador to Panama. "He has mastered the art of survival." 
20/wsj_2013:In keeping with America's long history of propping up Mr. Noriega, recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival.
20/wsj_2013:Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama's dire economic situation, says Mr. Moss, but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression, and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement. 
20/wsj_2013:Perhaps most important, Mr. Noriega's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases, to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne.
20/wsj_2013:His chief advantage in the fight: his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses.
20/wsj_2013:Luis Carlos, knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer, relayed Tony's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and, more important, among his officers and instructors.
20/wsj_2013:Born the illegitimate son of his father's maid, he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City.
20/wsj_2013:Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets, and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate.
20/wsj_2013:He considered himself intellectually superior to his Peruvian peers, many of whom were wayward sons sent by their well-off families to the highly disciplined, French-modeled academy as a sort of reform school. 
20/wsj_2013:In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed, French-made uniform, Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life, friends from the period say. "He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism, where officers were the elite with special privileges," recalls Darien Ayala, a fellow student in Peru and a lifelong friend. 
20/wsj_2013:United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama's national income.
20/wsj_2013:Mr. Noriega's initial retainer was only $50 to $100 a month, plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX, a former intelligence official says.
20/wsj_2013:A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City, capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy.
20/wsj_2013:By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses, he gained a ready cache of information.
20/wsj_2013:Mr. Noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy.
20/wsj_2013:So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of Puerto Armuelles, which was ruled by United Fruit Co.
20/wsj_2013:He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967, according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret.
20/wsj_2013:He flew to Fort Bragg, N.C., in September of that year for a course in psychological operations, returning to the School of the Americas in Panama for a two-month course called "military intelligence for officers." 
20/wsj_2013:Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty, but they did so falsely.
20/wsj_2013:He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier.
20/wsj_2013:He became Gen. Torrijos's inseparable shadow, and the holder of all Panama's secrets.
20/wsj_2013:When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega's moonlighting, intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans. 
20/wsj_2013:"Early on in the State Department, we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel, in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States," recalls Francis J. McNeil, who, as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977. "Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans." 
20/wsj_2013:During the Nixon administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2's connections to arrested drug traffickers.
20/wsj_2013:One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega, one of which was assassination. 
20/wsj_2013:The head of the DEA at the time, John Ingersoll, scotched the assassination plan.
20/wsj_2013:But he did fly to Panama to scold dictator Torrijos on the drug ties of Panamanian officials, including Mr. Noriega.
20/wsj_2013:Mr. Ingersoll later recalled that Gen. Torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the U.S. "Everybody was afraid of him," Mr. Ingersoll says. 
20/wsj_2013:Mr. Noriega became an even greater threat in 1976, when U.S. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army's 470th Military Intelligence Group.
20/wsj_2013:The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos's own phone, according to American intelligence officials. 
20/wsj_2013:For the first time, the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense, Mr. Turner says. "In the world of intelligence, if you want to get information, you get it from seedy characters.
20/wsj_2013:Mr. Turner was troubled enough to cancel the U.S. contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration. 
20/wsj_2013:Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr. Somoza.
20/wsj_2013:They included one of Mr. Noriega's closest friends and business partners, Carlos Wittgreen.
20/wsj_2013:Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen, the friend of Mr. Noriega, and the other four was dismissed on a technicality.
20/wsj_2013:But now, along with reindicting Mr. Noriega's pal, they intended to charge Mr. Noriega himself, on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $2 million in arms. 
20/wsj_2013:In January 1980, Jerome Sanford, as assistant U.S. attorney, was summoned to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Miami.
20/wsj_2013:Panamanian dictator Torrijos, he was told, had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington.
20/wsj_2013:After prodding from Mr. Sanford, U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington to let the indictment proceed. "Unfortunately," Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter, "those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control." The letter, along with a detailed prosecution memo, sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death. 
20/wsj_2013:In August 1983, Mr. Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama, having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos.
20/wsj_2013:Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua.
20/wsj_2013:And on at least one occasion, in the spring of 1985, he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua.
20/wsj_2013:Curtin Windsor, then the ambassador to Costa Rica, recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and "quiet, serious conversation" on the Aswara Peninsula.
20/wsj_2013:Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs, the U.S. ambassador to Panama, of the invitation. "Briggs screamed," Mr. Windsor recalls.
20/wsj_2013:As Mr. Noriega's political troubles grew, so did his offers of assistance to the Contras, an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington.
20/wsj_2013:Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora, his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges.
20/wsj_2013:Col. North conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams, who relayed it to Secretary of State George Shultz.
20/wsj_2013:The end of the marriage was at hand.
20/wsj_2013:The death of CIA Director William Casey and resignation of Oliver North allowed anti-Noriega political forces to gain influence.
20/wsj_2013:Public protests against him were triggered in June 1987 due to charges by Diaz Herrera, his former chief of staff, that Mr. Noriega had stolen the 1984 election and had ordered the killing of Messrs.
20/wsj_2013:In the end, is Mr. Noriega the political equivalent of Frankenstein's monster, created by a well-intentioned but misguided foreign power?
20/wsj_2015:The Federal Reserve Board said output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of 1.3% in the third quarter, substantially slower than the 3.3% annual rate in the second quarter. 
20/wsj_2015:"Capital spending and exports, which have been the driving force in this expansion, are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them," said Robert Dederick, economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
20/wsj_2015:The new reports of sluggishness, which were foreshadowed by an earlier Labor Department report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by 105,000 in September, give the Fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates. "They need to do something about this," said Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Group Inc. 
20/wsj_2015:The Fed also said U.S. industry operated at 83.6% of capacity last month, down from 83.8% in August. 
20/wsj_2015:Measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures.
20/wsj_2015:Factories operated at 83.7% of capacity, the lowest rate in more than a year and down from 84.1% in September. 
20/wsj_2015:Output of business equipment was unchanged in September.
20/wsj_2015:Production of factory equipment, one indication of the strength of manufacturers' investment spending, fell 0.3%. 
20/wsj_2015:Some economists expect further declines in investment spending. "Whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to soften subsequently," Mr. Harris said. "You haven't seen the full effect of that yet." 
20/wsj_2015:Here is a summary of the Federal Reserve Board's report on industrial production in September.
20/wsj_2015:The figures are seasonally adjusted. 142.3% of the 1977 average. 
20/wsj_2016:Robin Honiss, president and chief executive officer of this bank holding company, was elected to the additional posts of chairman, president and chief executive of the company's New England Savings Bank subsidiary.
20/wsj_2016:NESB is also the parent of Omnibank. 
20/wsj_2017:Lung-cancer mortality rates for people under 45 years of age have begun to decline, federal researchers report. 
20/wsj_2017:A report in this week's issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute also projects that overall U.S. mortality rates from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death, should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate. 
20/wsj_2017:The report, which comes 25 years after the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking, is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer. "What this is saying is that the surgeon general's message is having an impact," said Melvyn Tockman, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore. 
20/wsj_2017:The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart.
20/wsj_2017:The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000, but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6, a decline of 28.7%.
20/wsj_2017:The study, by Susan Devesa, William Blot and Joseph Fraumeni of the institute's staff, also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the 35-44 age bracket, except black men. 
20/wsj_2017:But Dr. Fraumeni, one of the authors of the report, said "the declining rates we're seeing for younger people we believe may be a harbinger of declining mortality in the future." However, he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking. 
20/wsj_2017:"Even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups, they can't be taken for granted," the report says. "Smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population, especially children, adolescents and minorities." 
20/wsj_2017:An editorial in the NCI Journal says the report of declining lung-cancer mortality "among young men and women in the U.S. indicates that we finally may be winning the battle -- this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over $2 billion a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking." 
20/wsj_2017:But the editorial, by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization, notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries. "Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior" around the world, the editorial says, through the enactment of laws that limit advertising, boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education. 
20/wsj_2017:Asked for comment, Walker Merryman, a vice president of the Tobacco Institute, said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the U.S. could violate the First Amendment protection of free speech. 
20/wsj_2017:According to the American Cancer Society, smoking is responsible for 85% of the lung-cancer cases among men and 75% among women.
20/wsj_2017:A higher proportion of black men smoke than white men.
20/wsj_2017:While nearly equal percentages of black and white women currently smoke, in both sexes more whites have given up smoking than blacks.

20/wsj_2019:Its counterpart, the Nasdaq Financial Index, was weak for most of the day, sliding 2.51 to 453.57 by the end of trading. 
20/wsj_2019:The volatility was dizzying for traders. "The market must have turned up and down 15 different times," commented Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody. "Every time you thought it was going into a rally it gave up, and every time you thought it would rally it came down.
20/wsj_2019:Most of trading action now is from professional traders who are trying to take advantage of the price swings to turn a quick profit, he and other traders said. "Everybody's confused and no one has an opinion that lasts longer than 30 seconds," said Mr. Zipper. "A lot of the professional traders are just going back and forth.

20/wsj_2020:In addition, Ralph Ingersoll II, 43, chairman and chief executive, said he would take on additional responsibilities as editor in chief of the company.
20/wsj_2020:Mr. Ingersoll remains editor in chief of the company's recently launched daily, the St. Louis Sun.
20/wsj_2021:Then cast-iron sewer pipe and the flush toilet were followed by sewage- and water-treatment plants toward the end of the 19th century.
20/wsj_2021:Then the 20th century saw the evolution of private-sector wonder drugs, which promulgated medical therapy.
20/wsj_2021:New Environmentalism probably started in 1962 with the publication of Rachel Carson's book "Silent Spring." Shortly thereafter, hysterical articles began to appear predicting that advanced industrial societies would produce a blackened, uninhabitable planet possibly by the turn of the century.
20/wsj_2021:Thousands of chemical products were categorized as carcinogenic, with recommendations that they be banned from industrial use because they produced malignant tumors in overdosed rats.
20/wsj_2021:Unknown before 1960 were the inconclusive effects of acid rain, greenhouse warming and ozone depletion, all of which required burgeoning political power and gargantuan expense. 
20/wsj_2021:Meanwhile, the New Environmentalists systematically opposed the methods of the Old Environmentalists.
20/wsj_2021:They are in the forefront of opposing the search for new landfills and methods of incineration and even oppose new methods of research such as genetic engineering. 
20/wsj_2021:New Environmentalism is an emotional attack on proven methods of improving our quality of life and a bid for political power.
20/wsj_2021:Your story missed some essential points of the conference on "The Global Environment: Are We Overreacting?" 
20/wsj_2021:First and foremost, the vignettes presented by the various scientists represent a general consensus among specialists working in the respective aspects of the global environment.
20/wsj_2021:Consider, for example, the greenhouse effect and climate change; numerous blue-ribbon scientific committees, including one from the National Academy of Science, judge there is a greater than 50% probability of a grave problem in the offing. 
20/wsj_2021:Nor was it intended to dictate a set of prescriptive solutions, although various points were raised.
20/wsj_2021:Each speaker was asked to address a specific topic, not deliver a point of view.
20/wsj_2021:This leads to a very special sense of urgency.
20/wsj_2021:The environment can no longer be a normal issue, to be dealt with on a business-as-usual basis with comfortable increments of change.
20/wsj_2021:We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet's atmosphere.
20/wsj_2021:The problems of the environment are so interrelated, so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it is unlikely we will be able to address them effectively unless major changes are made in less than 10 years.
20/wsj_2022:The results met estimates of analysts, who had already slashed their projections after the company said in late August that its 1989 earnings could tumble as much as 37%.
20/wsj_2022:The year-ago results, however, included the operations of a bottling business, which was sold last December. 
20/wsj_2022:Excluding that bottling business, Coca-Cola Enterprises' volume, measured by cases of soda, rose only 1%.
20/wsj_2022:The volume is well below the industry's 4% to 5% growth rate of recent years, but in line with other soft-drink companies for the third quarter.
20/wsj_2022:A spokesman attributed the bulk of a 14% increase in selling, administrative and general expenses -- to $324.9 million -- to marketing costs. "They're out there promoting like crazy, trying to get prices up by promotion," said Roy Burry, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co. 
20/wsj_2022:Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is 49%-owned by Coca-Cola Co., also said it repurchased about 1.2 million of its common shares during the third quarter.
20/wsj_2022:The buy-back is part of a 25-million-share repurchase plan, under which Coca-Cola Enterprises so far has acquired a total of 9.7 million shares. 
20/wsj_2022:The year-ago quarter's results include an after-tax charge of $5.9 million from the sale of a winery in Spain. 
20/wsj_2023:Currently, its parent company, Hooker Corp. of Sydney, Australia, is being managed by a court-appointed liquidator. 
20/wsj_2023:It is expected that GE Capital Corp., a financial-services subsidiary of General Electric Co., will provide much of the funding for the proposed leveraged buy-out of Merksamer, based in Sacramento, Calif.
20/wsj_2023:Sam Merksamer, chief executive officer of the nationwide jewelry chain, and Sanford Sigoloff, chief executive of L.J. Hooker Corp., both declined to comment. 
20/wsj_2023:Currently, Mr. Merksamer owns 20% of the company; L.J. Hooker acquired its 80% interest in the firm in May 1986.
20/wsj_2023:In recent weeks Mr. Merksamer has approached a number of his suppliers and asked them to provide letters of intent saying they will continue shipping merchandise to the chain following the buy-out, say those familiar with the situation.
20/wsj_2023:This year, a number of retail leveraged buyouts have failed, causing jitters among suppliers, and Mr. Merksamer apparently wanted assurances that he won't have delivery problems. 
20/wsj_2023:For the year ended June 30, 1989, Merksamer Jewelers had $62 million of revenue and operating profit of $2.5 million. 
20/wsj_2023:According to those familiar with the situation, other bidders included Ratners Group PLC of London and Kay Jewelers Inc. First Boston Corp. is advising L.J. Hooker on the sale of the Merksamer business. 
20/wsj_2023:Merksamer was the first in a series of retail acquisitions made by L.J. Hooker.
20/wsj_2023:The sale of Merksamer Jewelers is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
20/wsj_2024:Robert J. Regal was named president and chief executive officer of this company's Universal-Rundle Corp. unit.
20/wsj_2024:Mr. Regal had been president and chief executive of RBS Industries Inc. Robert H. Carlson, previous president and chief executive of Universal-Rundle, will assume the title of chairman of the unit, a vitreous-china maker. 
20/wsj_2025:NBC, a leader in morning, prime-time and late night programs but an also-ran on Saturday mornings, when children rule the TV set, is contemplating getting out of the cartoon business.
20/wsj_2025:"There is talk of some revamping and we're certainly heading in the direction of less and less animation," said Joseph S. Cicero, vice president of finance and administration for National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co. 
20/wsj_2025:One major NBC affiliate, KCRA in Sacramento, plans to cancel the NBC Saturday morning line-up as of January and replace it with a local newscast.
20/wsj_2025:They only accounted for 5%, at best, of the station's total revenues." 
20/wsj_2025:Spokesmen for the television networks of CBS Inc. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc., say there are no plans to alter the children's line-up on Saturday mornings. 
20/wsj_2025:At the same time, there appears to be a market for news-oriented programming; Turner Broadcasting System Inc. 's Cable News Network has its highest ratings, outside of prime time, on Saturday mornings. 
20/wsj_2025:NBC has on previous occasions considered replacing cartoons with a Saturday version of "Today," which is produced by NBC News.
20/wsj_2026:In the year-earlier quarter, the chemicals company had net of $49.8 million, or 75 cents a share. 
20/wsj_2026:The company also cited the stronger dollar, which cuts the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars. 
20/wsj_2026:Incrementally higher production of those chemicals which remain in heavy demand also has forced up costs, such as overtime pay. 
20/wsj_2027:Michael A. Gaskin, 55 years old, was named president and chief executive officer of this manufacturer of industrial robots, succeeding Walter K. Weisel.
20/wsj_2027:Mr. Gaskin formerly was president and chief executive of Taylor & Gaskin Inc. and was a director of Prab Robots since 1985. 
20/wsj_2028:Stephen N. Wertheimer was named managing director and group head of investment banking in Asia, based in Tokyo.
20/wsj_2029:I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs, levamisole and 5-fluorouracil, to any of my colon-cancer patients.
20/wsj_2029:With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon cancer by one-third -- but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer.
20/wsj_2029:I believe any physician who truly cares about cancer patients, both today and tomorrow, should offer the hope of something better than that.
20/wsj_2029:These research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better.
20/wsj_2029:We have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead.
20/wsj_2030:The oil and auto industries, united in their dislike of President Bush's proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels, announced a joint research program that could turn up a cleaner-burning gasoline. 
20/wsj_2030:Officials of the Big Three auto makers and 14 petroleum companies said they are setting out to find the most cost-effective fuel for reducing cities' air-pollution problems, with no bias toward any fuel in particular. 
20/wsj_2030:Instead, the tests will focus heavily on new blends of gasoline, which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is choking urban areas. 
20/wsj_2030:The initial $11 million research program will conduct the most extensive testing to date of reformulated gasolines, said Joe Colucci, head of fuels and lubricants at General Motors Corp. research laboratories.
20/wsj_2030:It will compare 21 different blends of gasolines with three mixtures of up to 85% methanol. 
20/wsj_2030:A second phase of research, which is still being planned, will test reformulated gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in 1992 or 1993 cars.
20/wsj_2030:"The whole idea here is the automobile and oil companies have joint customers," said Keith McHenry, a senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp. "And we are looking for the most cost-effective way to clean up the air." 
20/wsj_2031:William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said Lincoln Savings & Loan Association should have been seized by the government in 1986 to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion. 
20/wsj_2031:Mr. Seidman, who has been the nation's top bank regulator, inherited the problems of Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif., after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law.
20/wsj_2031:The inquiry also will cover the actions of Charles Keating Jr., who is chairman of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent, and who contributed heavily to several U.S. senators. 
20/wsj_2031:Mr. Seidman told the committee that the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created to sell sick thrifts, has studied Lincoln's examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986. "My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions, we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations," Mr. Seidman said. 
20/wsj_2031:When Lincoln was seized by the government, for example, 15% of its loans, or $250 million, were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of American Continental's 50 other subsidiaries, according to Mr. Seidman. 
20/wsj_2031:The bankruptcy filing, the government has charged in a $1.1 billion civil lawsuit, was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company, which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals.
20/wsj_2031:The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. "I think it's fairly clear {Mr.
20/wsj_2031:Leonard Bickwit, an attorney in Washington for Mr. Keating, declined to comment on the hearings, except to say, "We will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time." 
20/wsj_2031:Lincoln's treatment by former thrift regulators, in an agency disbanded by the new law, has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Mr. Keating.
20/wsj_2031:Mr. Seidman said yesterday, for example, that Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), who received $48,100 in contributions from Mr. Keating, phoned Mr. Seidman to request that he push for a sale of Lincoln before it would be seized. 
20/wsj_2031:The senator's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of Lincoln because "hundreds of Arizona jobs {at Lincoln} were on the line." 
20/wsj_2031:John Glenn (D., Ohio), John McCain, (R., Ariz.) and Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) also received substantial contributions from Mr. Keating and sought to intervene on behalf of Lincoln. 
20/wsj_2031:But a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators. 
20/wsj_2031:He also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of $225 million in American Continental subordinated debt.
20/wsj_2031:Some of those debtholders have filed a suit, saying they believed they were buying government-insured certificates of deposit. "We have no plans at this time to pay off those notes," he said. 
20/wsj_2032:Representatives of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman, Sachs & Co., hired by creditors to consult on Eastern's financial plans, told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that Eastern's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors' approval. 
20/wsj_2032:At a later news conference here, Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., said Eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 protection from creditors early next year, operating with more service than it originally had scheduled.
20/wsj_2032:Mr. Lorenzo made no mention of creditors' negative response to his plan. 
20/wsj_2032:"We're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly," Mr. Lorenzo told reporters. "We're meeting and surpassing our goals," he added. 
20/wsj_2032:It couldn't sell its South American routes, one of the major assets marked for disposal. 
20/wsj_2032:The committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze Eastern's plans.
20/wsj_2032:Ernst & Young said Eastern's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest, tax and depreciation by $100 million, and that Eastern's plan presented no comfort level, according to a source present at yesterday's session. 
20/wsj_2032:Starting next month, Eastern will begin flying 775 flights daily instead of the previously announced 700, they said. 
20/wsj_2032:If Eastern can get creditor support, court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift.
20/wsj_2032:But creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan, or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own.
20/wsj_2032:Mr. Lorenzo told reporters the reorganization Eastern is pursuing would create a carrier 85% to 90% of the size of the pre-bankruptcy Eastern.
20/wsj_2032:He projected it would be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring, only slightly fewer than the carrier's old volume of 1,050 a day. 
20/wsj_2033:HOPES OF SIMPLIFYING the corporate minimum tax before 1990 are weakening. 
20/wsj_2033:The method of calculating the 20% tax, paid if it exceeds tax figured the regular way, is due for a change in 1990, thanks to 1986's tax act.
20/wsj_2033:Proponents of simplification fear that the chances of getting it into the final bill are waning. "We hear it has low priority on the House side," says Samuel Starr of Coopers & Lybrand, CPAs.
20/wsj_2033:A loss -- after insurance recoveries -- is deductible only to the extent that it exceeds $100 and that the year's total losses exceed 10% of adjusted gross income; victims may pick the year when income is lower and deductions higher.
20/wsj_2033:Interest will be imposed on unpaid taxes, but late-payment penalties on the returns will be waived if the balance due and paid is 10% or less of the liability.
20/wsj_2033:ONE-DAY JAUNTS in a chartered boat were perks for permanent staffers of American Business Service Corp., a Costa Mesa, Calif., supplier of temporary workers.
20/wsj_2033:The IRS denied cost deductions because few of the temps got to go aboard.
20/wsj_2033:USED-CAR BUYERS who try to avoid sales tax by understating prices paid in private deals are the targets of a New York drive.
20/wsj_2033:Estimating that the state may lose $15 million a year, officials announced the filing of 15 criminal actions and "hundreds" of civil penalties. 
20/wsj_2033:WHEN AN IRA OWNER dies, the trustee of the individual retirement account must file forms 5498 reporting market values relating to the decedent and each beneficiary, with copies to the executor and beneficiaries.
20/wsj_2033:People often cite frugality and distrust of banks to justify cash caches to the IRS. Gregory Damonne Brown of Fremont, Calif., a hardworking, reclusive young bachelor, told that story to the Tax Court.
20/wsj_2033:But judges usually find the real aim is to escape tax on hidden income; and the IRS said Brown must have had such income -- although it uncovered no source -- because he deposited $124,732 in a bank account in 1982-84 while reporting income of only $52,012. 
20/wsj_2033:Brown's story: The deposits came from savings kept in a Tupperware breadbox; he saved $47,000 in 1974-81 by living with family members and pinching pennies and $45,000 of secret gifts from his remorseful father, who had abandoned the family in 1955.
20/wsj_2033:Brown had no proof; but testimony of his mother and stepmother about his father and of an ex-employer about his honesty and habits satisfied a judge that Brown was truthful and his tale of gifts was possible. 
20/wsj_2033:The IRS offered no evidence of hidden sources of taxable income, so Judge Shields rejected its claims. 
20/wsj_2033:BRIEFS: Asked how he made charitable gifts of $26,350 out of reported two-year income of $46,892, Thomas H. McFall of Bryan, Texas, told the Tax Court he had understated his income.
20/wsj_2033:The court rejected his incredible claims, denied his deductions, and imposed a negligence penalty. . . . Rep. Schaefer (R., Colo.) entered a bill to exempt from tax rewards for tips leading to the arrest of violent criminals. 
20/wsj_2034:After a tortuous climb, she is rewarded by a picture-postcard vista: a glade of golden aspens under an azure Indian-summer sky. 
20/wsj_2034:This place is 12 miles into the back country -- a day-long trudge for a hiker, but reached by Ms. Peterson and six others in a mere two hours of pedaling fat-tired mountain bikes. 
20/wsj_2034:They have even sent helicopters in pursuit of bikers after hikers and equestrians complained they were being driven from trails. 
20/wsj_2034:"We were being overrun," says Steve Fiala, trails coordinator of the East Bay Regional Park District.
20/wsj_2034:From about 200,000 six years ago, the number of mountain bikes in the U.S. is expected to grow to 10 million in 1990.
20/wsj_2034:The controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all-terrain bicycles is one of the most divisive storms to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory. 
20/wsj_2034:Bikers -- many of them ardent environmentalists -- proclaim their sport an efficient, safe, fitness-promoting way to get back to nature, while asserting a right, as taxpayers, to pedal on public lands.
20/wsj_2034:Key to the issue is that the bikes, in skillful hands, can go virtually anywhere, and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror.
20/wsj_2034:An adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance.
20/wsj_2034:Such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour -- a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians. 
20/wsj_2034:The state of California, following the lead of some regional parks, recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles.
20/wsj_2034:Even the U.S. Forest Service, whose lenient "multiple-use" philosophy permits motorized vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the U.S., has begun to close some lands to the bikes, including major portions of the popular Pacific Crest Trail, which stretches from California to Canada. 
20/wsj_2034:Sierra has been instrumental in securing a number of the California bans.
20/wsj_2034:Yet Sierra's hard-line stance has created something of a rift in the organization, which estimates that 17% of its 500,000 members own mountain bikes.
20/wsj_2034:But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes won't injure the environment or other users. "I have a mountain bike, yet as a hiker I've been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them," says Gene Coan, an official at Sierra's headquarters in San Francisco, echoing the concerns of many members. 
20/wsj_2034:"People who feel that cyclists should be banned from an area aren't looking at the whole picture," complains Mark Langton, associate editor of Mountain and City Biking magazine in Canoga Park, Calif. 
20/wsj_2034:Mr. Langton is among the legions of bikers who got their first taste of wilderness as hikers or backpackers.
20/wsj_2034:Biking groups in Montana, Idaho, Michigan and Massachusetts have won similar concessions, says Tim Blumenthal, mountain bike editor of Bicycling magazine. 
20/wsj_2034:Even staunch anti-bike Sierra members concede that 10% of all riders cause most of the problems.
20/wsj_2034:While some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations, much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through "education and peer pressure," says Jim Hasenauer, a director of the International Mountain Biking Association. "I think we're making progress." 
20/wsj_2034:Last year, 25% of the 10 million bicycles sold in the U.S. were mountain bikes.
20/wsj_2034:In California, a bellwether market, they accounted for more than 80% of all bike sales.
20/wsj_2034:The majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country.
20/wsj_2034:Crested Butte, population 1,200, is a bastion of the sport.
20/wsj_2034:The town is home to the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and it hosts the annual Fat Tire Bike Week.
20/wsj_2034:This summer, the jamboree attracted more visitors than the busiest week of the town's winter ski season. 
20/wsj_2034:David Lindsey, chairman of the Fat Tire Bike celebration, muses that the bike's popularity may be a combination of technology and nostalgia. "The mountain bike feels as comfortable as the `paperboy' bike you had as a kid, but it can do so much more," he says. 
20/wsj_2035:Canada's Province of Nova Scotia, shelf offering of up to $550 million of debentures. 
20/wsj_2035:Golar Gas Holding Co., a subsidiary of Gotaas-Larsen Shipping Corp., offering of $280 million first preferred ship mortgage notes, via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 
20/wsj_2035:H.F. Ahmanson & Co., offering of four million shares of noncumulative convertible preferred stock, Series B., via Goldman, Sachs & Co, First Boston Corp., and Merrill Lynch. 
20/wsj_2035:Shared Technologies Inc., offering of 2.5 million common shares, via Smetek, Van Horn & Cormack Inc. and Oakes, Fitzwilliams & Co. 
20/wsj_2036:Early yesterday, investors scrambled to buy Treasury bonds for safety as stock prices plummeted and fears mounted of a replay of Friday.
20/wsj_2036:But stocks later recovered, erasing most of their early declines.
20/wsj_2036:"The stock market clearly is leading the bond markets," said Jack Conlon, an executive vice president at Nikko Securities. "People are breathing a major sigh of relief that the world didn't end Monday morning" or yesterday. 
20/wsj_2036:Gold, a closely watched barometer of investor anxiety, was little changed.
20/wsj_2036:Federal Reserve officials sent another signal of their determination to shore up investor confidence.
20/wsj_2036:Nikko's Mr. Conlon fears a huge wave of Treasury borrowing early next month will drive down Treasury bond prices.
20/wsj_2036:But several other traders contend investors have overreacted to junk-bond jitters, and that stock prices will continue to recover. "They shot the whole orchestra just because the piano player hit a bad note," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates Inc., referring to the stock market's plunge Friday on news of trouble in financing the UAL Corp. buy-out. 
20/wsj_2037:The Consumer News and Business Channel cable network and U.S. News & World Report have formed a joint venture to produce cable program versions of special issues of the magazine. 
20/wsj_2037:The programs will run on the cable network the Sunday evening immediately prior to the release of the special issue of U.S. News & World Report.
20/wsj_2037:CNBC is a joint venture of the National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., and Cablevision System Corp. 
20/wsj_2037:The first program scheduled in the joint venture is "The 1990 Homeowner's Guide." Other programs and special issues will be based on themes of health, jobs, personal finance, the best colleges, and investments.
20/wsj_2039:In the 1988 third quarter, the forest-products company reported profit of $144.9 million, or 69 cents a share. 
20/wsj_2039:Results for the 1989 third quarter and nine months include a pretax loss of $33 million from the company's business improvement and refocusing program, and a gain of $49 million on the sale of a subsidiary's common stock. 
20/wsj_2039:Weyerhaeuser's pulp and paper operations were up for the nine months, but full-year performance depends on the balance of operating and maintenance costs, plus pricing of certain products, the company said. 
20/wsj_2040:The new reserves bring the company's provision for loans to Third World countries to $2.6 billion, or 85% of Bankers Trust's medium and long-term loans to these countries. 
20/wsj_2040:Get the problem behind you and don't look back," said James J. McDermott, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in approving of the move.
20/wsj_2040:Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco posted a 17% jump.
20/wsj_2040:PNC Financial Corp., the parent of Pittsburgh National Bank, reported net income climbed 9.8%, while net for Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, grew 3.8%. 
20/wsj_2040:Analysts were only slightly disappointed by Citicorp's numbers. "There's nothing in here that's horrible and nothing to make you think they're setting the world on fire," said Carole Berger, analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. Earnings from the bank's global consumer business grew 27%. "The consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream," said Mr. McDermott of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. 
20/wsj_2040:Corporate finance and trading results in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were "relatively flat, sometimes choppy," the bank said, and profit for the area sank 27%. 
20/wsj_2040:But he reiterated the bank's position that it is comfortable with the current level of $2.6 billion, covering about 30% of the $8.9 billion of such loans outstanding. 
20/wsj_2040:Ronald I. Mandle, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., called Citicorp's venture-capital gains of $93 million before taxes "strong." A "concerning" item the analyst cited was the 10% jump in expenses, which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business.
20/wsj_2040:Wells Fargo continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks, minimizing a drop in net interest margin with 13% third-quarter growth in high-yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages.
20/wsj_2040:Its margin fell only seven basis points, or 7/100ths of a percentage point, from a year ago, compared with a 13-point drop at Security Pacific Corp. and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country. 
20/wsj_2040:The combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave Wells Fargo a 1.25% return on average assets for the quarter, about 40% higher than Security Pacific's and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the U.S. Wells Fargo's return on equity increased to 24.4% from 23.8%. 
20/wsj_2040:Wells Fargo has sold all of its non-trade loans made to less-developed countries, and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans, which fell 8% from the previous quarter to $806.8 million from $880.9 million.
20/wsj_2040:But the amount was still 39% higher than the year-ago level, and 25% higher as a percentage of total loans.
20/wsj_2040:Manufacturers Hanover said that excluding the addition to its reserves, certain tax benefits, and a one-time $16 million gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company, third-quarter earnings were $75 million.
20/wsj_2040:The bank's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to $2.4 billion, covering 36% of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations. 
20/wsj_2040:The net interest margin-the difference between the bank's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in the quarter, as did certain areas of wholesale banking. 
20/wsj_2040:Fees from syndicating loans dropped 48%, to $21 million. "We didn't take part in a lot of deals" in the quarter "because their credit quality was poor," the spokesman said.
20/wsj_2040:The bank's total allowance for credit losses was $502.1 million, or 1.82% of total loans. 
20/wsj_2041:Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling Congress (I) Party control of the government. 
20/wsj_2041:Much depends on the opposition, a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former Gandhi cabinet minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh. 
20/wsj_2041:The biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against Mr. Gandhi and his five years in power -- five years of ups and downs, promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity. 
20/wsj_2041:Yesterday, four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party, Mr. Gandhi called elections for the lower house of Parliament on Nov. 22 and 24.
20/wsj_2041:The elections will be held in different states on one of the two days. (The lower house's five-year term expires in January; the Parliament's upper house is appointed.) 
20/wsj_2041:The elections will be a rigorous test for the 45-year-old prime minister and Congress (I), which in various forms has ruled for 40 of India's 42 years of independence.
20/wsj_2041:After a landslide win in 1984 in polls held after the assassination of his mother, Indira Gandhi, Mr. Gandhi saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride. 
20/wsj_2041:Some analysts predict that disappointment in Mr. Gandhi's spent pledge to reduce corruption and heavy-handed local government will crest at the polls. "There's a wide feeling of indignation across the country," says Bhabani Sen Gupta of the Center for Policy Research, in New Delhi. "I think the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman, by a corrupt revenue collector.
20/wsj_2041:Even if the Congress (I) retains control of the government, Mr. Gandhi's ability to push through major initiatives might be hobbled by a thinner majority.
20/wsj_2041:Economic analysts call his trail-blazing liberalization of the Indian economy incomplete, and many are hoping for major new liberalizations if he is returned firmly to power. 
20/wsj_2041:The Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament, has 542 elected and two appointed seats.
20/wsj_2041:In 1984, the Congress (I) captured 405 seats, the largest victory in the history of Indian democracy.
20/wsj_2041:In 1977, Mrs. Gandhi was thrown out of office after her 19-month emergency rule, and in 1980, after her successors made a mess of their three years in power, she was restored to office. 
20/wsj_2041:Chimanbhai Mehta, a parliamentarian and former Gandhi ally, predicts Congress (I) will win only 150 seats, a quarter of the house, if the opposition fields single candidates in 80% of the races.
20/wsj_2041:Analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to unite, and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates. 
20/wsj_2041:The arms-kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign, but it's unclear how it is viewed by average Indian voters.
20/wsj_2041:In 1986, India signed a $1.4 billion contract with AB Bofors, a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB, to purchase 400 artillery pieces.
20/wsj_2041:The contract was negotiated by the countries' two prime ministers, and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents' costs. 
20/wsj_2041:But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence.
20/wsj_2041:The scandal has faded and flared, but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages, and that has helped galvanize the opposition, which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills.
20/wsj_2041:That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi, whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power.
20/wsj_2041:"We don't like the Congress (I)," says Sooraji Jath, a farmer in the western state of Gujarat. "The Congress government is taking the farmers' bread and not giving us any support.
20/wsj_2041:The greatest thing going for Mr. Gandhi and the Congress (I) Party is the poor reputation of the opposition.
20/wsj_2041:Many Indians fear a repeat of that experience. 
20/wsj_2041:March 24, 1986: AB Bofors, a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB, enters into a $1.4 billion contract with India's Defense Ministry to supply 400 Bofors FH-77B 155-mm field howitzer guns.
20/wsj_2041:April 16, 1987: Swedish National Radio reports that about $40 million -- nearly 3% of the total contract -- was paid by Bofors as commissions to middlemen. 
20/wsj_2041:June 1, 1987: Sweden's National Audit Bureau releases its report confirming payment of about $40 million to unidentified Indians.
20/wsj_2041:The report says that investigations were severely hampered by lack of cooperation from Bofors.
20/wsj_2041:Bofors says it can't disclose the names of the middlemen because it would jeopardize industrial confidentiality.
20/wsj_2041:A portion of the report containing names of the middlemen is withheld by officials citing bank secrecy requirements. 
20/wsj_2041:Aug. 6, 1987: Prime Minister Gandhi tells the Indian Parliament, ". . . neither I nor any member of my family has received any consideration in these transactions.
20/wsj_2041:Aug. 26, 1987: Bofors admits payments of $41 million to middlemen. 
20/wsj_2041:April 22, 1988: The Hindu newspaper publishes facsimiles of bank documents for foreign-exchange remittances and letters between Bofors and certain private companies related to the sale of the guns to India. 
20/wsj_2041:July 18, 1989: The comptroller and auditor-general of India reports serious lapses in the government's technical and financial evaluation of the Bofors deal. 
20/wsj_2041:Sept. 15, 1989: Retired army Chief of Staff Krishnaswami Sundarji discloses in an interview that he suggested in May 1987 that the government cancel the Bofors contract.
20/wsj_2041:According to Gen. Sundarji, that would have forced Bofors to disclose the names of the middlemen who received kickbacks from the company.
20/wsj_2041:Oct. 9. 1989: The Hindu newspaper publishes the withheld portion of the Swedish National Audit Bureau's report.
20/wsj_2041:The disclosures state that commissions were paid by Bofors to an Indian agent of the arms company. 
20/wsj_2042:Parsow Partnership Ltd. and Elkhorn Partners L.P. said they may seek proposals from third parties relating to a sale or restructuring of CACI International Inc. 
20/wsj_2042:In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Parsow and Elkhorn, which together hold 8.685% of CACI's common shares, said they think it is in the best interest of CACI stockholders that the company be sold. 
20/wsj_2042:The partnerships said they may seek board representation, and they may seek the support of CACI's board and other major shareholders in connection with their plans. 
20/wsj_2042:Their combined stake consists of 880,500 CACI common shares, including 86,500 shares bought in the past 60 days at $2.3125 to $2.4375 a share.
20/wsj_2043:Treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a $4 billion offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt. 
20/wsj_2043:Fed officials injected more cash into the banking system by arranging $1.5 billion of repurchase agreements during the usual pre-noon intervention period.
20/wsj_2043:It already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline 1/4 percentage point to about 8 3/4% from its previous target level of about 9%.
20/wsj_2043:The rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans, is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy.
20/wsj_2043:The Macy's issue closed up about one point at a bid price of 97. 
20/wsj_2043:Strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from $3 billion. 
20/wsj_2043:Traders said hedging related to the TVA pricing also pressured Treasury bonds. "Underwriters of the TVA bonds reduced their market risk by selling Treasurys to cover at least part of their {TVA} holdings," said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. 
20/wsj_2043:Today the Treasury will announce the size of its next two-year note sale and Resolution Funding Corp. will announce details of its first bond offering.
20/wsj_2043:Some traders estimate $9.75 billion of new two-year Treasurys will be sold next week, and they expect Refcorp to offer $4 billion to $6 billion of long-term "bailout" bonds.
20/wsj_2043:The Office of Finance of the Federal Home Loan Banks said it priced a four-part $2.27 billion bond offering for the banks to yield from 8.125% to 8.375%. 
20/wsj_2043:The release of several economic reports had little impact on the market, including a report that the U.S. trade deficit expanded to a surprisingly wide $10.77 billion in August, up from a revised $8.24 billion in July.
20/wsj_2043:The discount rate on three-month bills rose to 7.52% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.75%.
20/wsj_2043:The rate on six-month bills rose to 7.53% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.92%. 
20/wsj_2043:TVA offered $2 billion of 30-year bonds priced to yield 9.06%; $1 billion in 10-year notes priced to yield 8.42%; and $1 billion in five-year notes priced to yield 8.33%. 
20/wsj_2043:The TVA, which operates one of the nation's largest electric power systems, is a corporation wholly owned by the U.S. government.
20/wsj_2043:Yesterday's bond sale was part of a $6.7 billion refinancing plan to pay off high-interest debt the TVA owes the Federal Financing Bank, an arm of the Treasury. 
20/wsj_2043:The revival of the real estate mortgage investment conduit market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after two days of volatile trading.
20/wsj_2043:The Remic issuance supported prices of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities, which held up better than Government National Mortgage Association securities during an afternoon sell-off. 
20/wsj_2043:Long tax-exempt dollar bonds were mostly flat to 3/8 point lower after a whipsaw session of moving inversely to stocks in modest dealer-led trading. 
20/wsj_2043:Prices of pre-refunded municipal bonds were capped by news that Chemical Securities Inc., as agent for a customer, will accept bids today for two large lists of bonds that include many such issues.
20/wsj_2043:Pre-refunded bonds are called at their earliest call date with the escrowed proceeds of another bond issue. 
20/wsj_2043:Underwriters led by PaineWebber Inc. set preliminary pricing for $144.4 million of California Health Facilities Financing Authority revenue bonds for Kaiser Permanente.
20/wsj_2043:As part of its College Savings Plan, Connecticut offered $100.4 million of general obligation capital appreciation bonds priced to yield to maturity from 6.25% in 1994 to 6.90% in 2006, 2007 and 2009. 
20/wsj_2043:The benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at a price of 96, off 0.15 point to yield 5.27%. 
20/wsj_2044:Separately, the bill gives authority to the Bush administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low-income and moderate-income homeowners. 
20/wsj_2044:And a squad of influential former Senate aides employed by the Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers came to the Capitol in a vain attempt to strip the provision.
20/wsj_2044:By an 11-2 margin, Senate negotiators voted to preserve the 235 mortgage refinancing plan, and despite powerful allies, the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives. 
20/wsj_2044:This sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere, and conservative Sen. Phil Gramm cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests. "We are stewards here, not of the mortgage companies, but the taxpayers," said the Texas Republican. 
20/wsj_2044:The action came as the administration won final congressional approval of $9 million in assistance for elections scheduled in Nicaragua in February.
20/wsj_2044:The bulk of the money would be funneled through the National Endowment for Democracy, but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money's true purpose and its ultimate destination. 
20/wsj_2044:Final approval -- on a 64-35 roll call -- was never in doubt, but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators, including Republicans Jesse Helms and Warren Rudman and Democrats Bill Bradley and John Glenn. 
20/wsj_2044:Critics warned such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party's standing, and one irony is that under Nicaraguan law a major portion of the opposition party's funds must be shared with the government's Supreme Electoral Council. 
20/wsj_2044:Within the appropriations conference yesterday, the $67 billion measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science, housing, veterans and the environment.
20/wsj_2044:These costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal 1991, and the measure further commits Congress to a set of costly projects, including the first construction funds for the space station.
20/wsj_2044:And while setting a statutory limit of $1.6 billion on the automated space probe, the conference appropriated $30 million for the start-up of the CRAF-Cassini mission, a successor to the Voyager space probe. 
20/wsj_2044:The most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds, where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued at $20 million, and the conference added 15 more valued at $8 million to ostensibly preserve "balance" between the House and Senate. 
20/wsj_2044:And after weeks of delay, the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape.
20/wsj_2044:And among domestic programs, the most serious threat is White House opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the District of Columbia and Department of Health and Human Services.
20/wsj_2044:In a sharply written letter, Rep. David Obey, chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations, warned Mr. Bush that the result of his "ultimatum" could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere. "As a result of your ultimatum," writes the Wisconsin Democrat, "I guess there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference, inasmuch regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this bill." 
20/wsj_2045:Gold, which hasn't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time, yesterday achieved what may be a new level of impassiveness: The most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market. 
20/wsj_2045:The settlement prices of the December, February and April gold contracts were even with Monday's final prices.
20/wsj_2045:The other months posted advances of 10 cents to 20 cents an ounce. 
20/wsj_2045:According to one analyst, Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber, New York, the stock market's ability on Monday to rally from last Friday's decline -- which seemed to indicate that the economy wasn't going to fall either -- took the starch out of precious metals prices, and out of gold's, in particular. 
20/wsj_2045:"December delivery gold is trading in a range of $365 to $375 {an ounce} and is having difficulty breaking out above that," Mr. Savaiko said. "Producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold." 
20/wsj_2045:Jeffrey Nichols, president of APMS Canada, Toronto precious metals advisers, said there is little to motivate gold traders to buy the metal. "Investors in the U.S. and Europe are comfortable with the actions of the {Federal Reserve} in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system, which helped the stock market rebound on Monday," he said. 
20/wsj_2045:There isn't any rush on the part of investors in the West to buy gold, he said. "They still bear the memory of October 1987, when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell," Mr. Nichols said. "It's an experience they don't want to repeat." 
20/wsj_2045:Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader for Chase Manhattan Bank, said: "There is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its `flight to safety' quality.
20/wsj_2045:The most remarkable feature about yesterday's action was that the price of roughly $370 an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold, Mr. Mehta said. 
20/wsj_2045:According to an analyst, Cuba can't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked Japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year, into early next year. "Japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar," the analyst said.
20/wsj_2045:It was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices, the analyst said.
20/wsj_2045:LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: The prices of cattle, hogs and pork belly futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the Friday stock market plunge would chill consumer spending, which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork.
20/wsj_2045:The prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply Monday.
20/wsj_2045:GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: The prices of most soybean and soybean-meal futures contracts rose amid rumors that the Soviet Union is interested in buying from the U.S. or South America about 250,000 metric tons of soybeans and as many as 400,000 metric tons of soybean meal.
20/wsj_2045:Traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible U.S. soybean sales because U.S. exports are lagging.
20/wsj_2045:Since Sept. 1, about 13 million fewer bushels of U.S. soybeans have been sold overseas than for the same period last year.
20/wsj_2047:The nations of southern Africa know a lot about managing elephants; their herds are thriving.
20/wsj_2047:But the nations of Europe and North America have decided they know better.
20/wsj_2047:A Zimbabwean delegate argued that the ban would "guarantee the extinction of the elephant." Legitimate ranchers, who have an interest in preserving the herds, would go out of business.
20/wsj_2047:Fortunately, the nations of southern Africa haven't totally surrendered their sovereignty.
20/wsj_2047:The director of Zimbabwe's Wildlife Department described American conservationists as "fat little puppies from urban environments who don't know a thing about Africa." That's not fair; they're not all fat. 
20/wsj_2048:The Small Business Administration has received more than 5,000 formal requests for disaster loans because of the hurricane.
20/wsj_2048:About 45% of requests for SBA relief loans, which also are available to homeowners, come from small businesses, compared with a 25% business share after most disasters.
20/wsj_2048:Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce began using its national TV show to seek help, such as equipment, for business owners. 
20/wsj_2048:In lobbying on other health-coverage topics, the National Federation of Independent Business will press for legislation that would give self-employed people a 100% tax deduction for their own health plans, up from 25% currently.
20/wsj_2048:Small-business groups also will fight the medical-leave provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves.
20/wsj_2048:"With the repeal of Section 89, we can no longer say they're discouraging businesses from offering health plans," says Christine Russell, the Chamber of Commerce's small-business advocate. 
20/wsj_2048:JUMPING THE GUN: Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) was outraged after a private word to John Motley, lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, resulted in a news release saying that the Senate Finance Committee chairman would recommend repeal of Section 89.
20/wsj_2048:SMALL TALK: Some 70% of graduates who recently earned an M.B.A. degree say they'd prefer to work in or own a small company, yet most take jobs with large concerns, says a survey by the Foster McKay Group, a New York recruiting firm. . . . Cardinal Scientific Inc. of Waldorf, Md., seeks a Small Business Innovation Research grant to produce a "nozzle assembly for an Army mass delousing outfit." 
20/wsj_2049:Banc One said "it is contemplated" that John B. McCoy, chairman and chief executive officer, will assume the additional position of president upon Mr. McKinney's retirement. 
20/wsj_2049:Mr. McKinney, 50 years old, was chairman and chief executive of American Fletcher Corp., Indianapolis, when that bank holding company merged into Banc One in January 1987.
20/wsj_2049:The company said Mr. McKinney plans to retire because the process of affiliating American Fletcher into Banc One "is considered completed." 
20/wsj_2049:Mr. McKinney will continue as chairman of the board and chairman of the executive committee of Banc One Indiana Corp., the successor company to American Fletcher Corp., but will no longer be active in day-to-day management.
20/wsj_2050:The Treasury plans to raise $1.55 billion in new cash with the sale Monday of about $15.6 billion in short-term bills to redeem $14.1 billion in maturing bills. 
20/wsj_2051:Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered ratings on about $650 million of Beatrice Co. debt, citing the closely held Chicago food concern's proposed recapitalization. 
20/wsj_2051:Moody's said the proposed recaptilization may "limit the company's ability to realize its profit potential" and that paying dividends from a new series of preferred could squeeze "basic business operations." A Beatrice spokesman didn't return calls seeking comment. 
20/wsj_2052:When the Soviets announced their last soldier had left Afghanistan in February, the voices of skepticism were all but drowned out by an international chorus of euphoria.
20/wsj_2052:Millions of refugees would rush home.
20/wsj_2052:Eight months after Gen. Boris Gromov walked across the bridge into the U.S.S.R., a Soviet-controlled regime remains in Kabul, the refugees sit in their camps, and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever. 
20/wsj_2052:The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid.
20/wsj_2052:The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat, that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did.
20/wsj_2052:Gen. Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $1 billion of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime.
20/wsj_2052:By early May, Moscow had delivered, for example, 1,000 trucks, about 100 tanks, artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles.
20/wsj_2052:Later that month, it added an entire tank brigade, including 120 T-72 tanks and more than 40 BMP state-of-the-art infantry fighting vehicles.
20/wsj_2052:In the last few weeks, Moscow has added FROG-7B missiles, the bomber version of the An-12, MiG-23BN high-altitude aircraft, MiG-29s, which can outfly Pakistan's U.S.-built F16s, and Sukhoi SU-27 fighter-bombers, which can outfly the MiG-29s. 
20/wsj_2052:Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the U.S.S.R. and other East bloc nations; 30,000 to 40,000 of these troops have returned. 
20/wsj_2052:In addition, the regime has established well-paid paramilitary forces totaling more than 100,000, including 35,000 Soviet-trained troops of the Interior Ministry (KHAD/WAD), which still is directed by 1,500 Soviet KGB officers.
20/wsj_2052:And thousands of Afghan children have been taken to the Soviet Union, where they are hostage for the behavior of their families. 
20/wsj_2052:In preparation for the withdrawal, Moscow, Kabul and New Delhi signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian Indian experts to replace some of the more visible Soviet military personnel.
20/wsj_2052:The Soviets cut a deal with Iran: a future Iranian role in Afghanistan in exchange for Iranian support of Soviet policy.
20/wsj_2052:The deal was symbolized by the restoration of the Shi'ite Sultan Ali Keshtmand to the Afghan prime ministry. 
20/wsj_2052:Moreover, serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces.
20/wsj_2052:Before his assassination in 1988, President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn.
20/wsj_2052:In this they are aided by years of American, European, Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public.
20/wsj_2052:At the last minute, however, Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar, perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists, with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces.
20/wsj_2052:Indeed, U.S. officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves by the end of this year.
20/wsj_2052:For a decade U.S. policy has been incoherent, based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf.
20/wsj_2052:A cutoff of U.S. military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain.
20/wsj_2052:Creation of a new, realistic U.S. policy is long overdue. 
20/wsj_2052:Ms. Klass, editor and co-author of "Afghanistan: The Great Game Revisited" (Freedom House), directs the Freedom House program on Afghanistan/Southwest Asia. 
20/wsj_2053:Nothing stirred the soul of Ronald Reagan and his disciples as much as the crusade to aid Nicaragua's Contra rebels, or the dream of building a space-based defense shield to knock out Soviet nuclear missiles. 
20/wsj_2053:And, surprisingly, little more than a whimper of protest is being heard, even though Reaganauts once breathed fire supporting the Contras and the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
20/wsj_2053:It isn't surprising that President Bush hasn't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI. Though he nominally supports both programs, Mr. Bush hasn't been a passionate champion of either cause, as Mr. Reagan was. 
20/wsj_2053:What's surprising is that there isn't more of a conservative outcry as the Bush administration lets the programs slip down the national-priority list.
20/wsj_2053:A combination of factors -- a weariness among some conservatives, a decline in the perception of a Soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues -- seem to explain the strange tranquility. 
20/wsj_2053:You hate to do it because he's your father." Mr. Burton says conservatives' unhappiness with Mr. Bush's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in Panama will make them more willing to speak out. 
20/wsj_2053:Of course, neither President Bush nor the Congress has actually abandoned the Contras or SDI. Mr. Bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the Contras until Nicaragua holds national elections next February. 
20/wsj_2053:Instead of focusing on the Contras, Mr. Bush has switched to urging members of Congress -- most recently in a White House meeting yesterday -- to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua's Sandinista government. 
20/wsj_2053:The administration continues to support SDI, or Star Wars, and it recently lobbied to persuade the Senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program.
20/wsj_2053:The administration also acknowledges that it isn't pursuing Mr. Reagan's original vision of an "impenetrable shield" protecting the whole U.S., but rather a more modest version. 
20/wsj_2053:As a result, Frank Gaffney, a former Reagan Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy, charges that the administration's "professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the SDI program strain credulity." 
20/wsj_2053:In fact, because communism seems to be beating a global retreat, some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they don't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs. "The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us cannot get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing," says Mitchell Daniels, a former Reagan White House aide who now is president of the Hudson Institute. 
20/wsj_2053:Some activists are toiling to raise the profile of the two causes.
20/wsj_2053:But they say they can't make much headway because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide. 
20/wsj_2053:One longtime champion of these programs in Congress, Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, is distracted by questions about his ethics, conservatives note.
20/wsj_2053:Above all, though, proponents say neither the Contra nor the SDI cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support. "For there to be wind in the sails of any program, the chief executive has to be blowing in the sails," says Rep. Burton. 
20/wsj_2054:We're sorry to report that on Monday President Bush accepted the resignation of William Allen as chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.
20/wsj_2054:Mr. Allen, appointed by President Reagan, grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies. 
20/wsj_2054:Mr. Allen's commissioners voted to call his unread speech "thoughtless, disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory." Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was "another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman." Rep. Don Edwards, the California Democrat, warned Mr. Allen that the speech would be "outside the scope of the commission's jurisdiction." Thomas Stoddard, head of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, called the prospect of the speech "frankly shocking." 
20/wsj_2054:He said that other participants in the conference "do not believe that the rights of Americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual," but that "I mean to persuade you to the opposite view." 
20/wsj_2054:He recalled to the audience a "strange, infelicitous" analogy he once heard arguing "now that we have finally recognized that American blacks have rights, we need to do the same for animals." Mr. Allen objected to this analogy because it seems to "assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals -- as a mere project of charity, of humaneness." Rights on such a basis, whether for blacks or homosexuals, are "mere indulgences," he said, subject to being taken back. 
20/wsj_2054:He says the title of his speech was to make his point that Americans have rights as individuals, not as members of certain select groups.
20/wsj_2054:His speech criticized the "idiocy of notions of protected groups in society" as opposed to individual equality or, as he put it, in "a common destiny as Americans." Instead of lobbying for special treatment, Mr. Allen said that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk "invidious retrenchment with government complicity." 
20/wsj_2054:Mr. Allen, who teaches government at prestigious Harvey Mudd College in California and will remain a member of the commission, has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals' rights.
20/wsj_2054:Mr. Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again, which somehow elevated the vague concept of "Indian rights" above the rights of individual Indians. 
20/wsj_2054:There is a huge divide between Mr. Allen's we're-all-in-this-together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups.
20/wsj_2054:Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument.
20/wsj_2054:Their effort to run him out of Washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement.
20/wsj_2054:We hope the next head of the Civil Rights Commission will be as brave as Mr. Allen in making the case for equality of civil rights. 
20/wsj_2055:Bearings Inc. said its chairman, John R. Cunin, will retire as an officer of the company on Jan. 2. 
20/wsj_2055:Mr. Cunin, 65 years old, was chief executive of the distributor of bearings and power-transmission products from 1982 to 1988.
20/wsj_2055:The appointments are part of a planned succession at the company. 
20/wsj_2055:Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev opened a major U.S. trade exhibition in Moscow and spent two hours touring some of the 150 stalls representing such blue-chip companies as General Motors Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Johnson & Johnson.
20/wsj_2055:A Daikin executive in charge of exports when the high-purity halogenated hydrocarbon was sold to the Soviets in 1986 received a suspended 10-month jail sentence.
20/wsj_2055:Judge Masaaki Yoneyama told the Osaka District Court Daikin's "responsibility is heavy because illegal exports lowered international trust in Japan." Sale of the solution in concentrated form to Communist countries is prohibited by Japanese law and by international agreement. 
20/wsj_2055:The move reflected the growing confidence of the revamped Supreme Soviet. 
20/wsj_2055:But it was opposed by some environmentalists as a threat to Irian Jaya's forests and a potential source of social unrest for the primitive tribes who inhabit them. 
20/wsj_2055:Yaohan Departmentstore Co. of Japan is moving its international-operations headquarters and holding company to Hong Kong to gain from the British colony's economic advantages and tax structure.
20/wsj_2055:With funds of 5.56 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$712 million), the new company, Yaohan International Co., plans to acquire 10 of Hong Kong's top restaurants.
20/wsj_2055:Christie's will soon have a sale of Dada and Symbolist art while Sotheby's is luring collectors with sales of Swiss, German, Spanish, Australian and Canadian paintings.
20/wsj_2055:Berlin's Villa Grisebach will auction art works with pre-sale estimates of less than $1,600 on Nov. 25.
20/wsj_2055:The auction house, known for its sales of top-drawer 19th and 20th century works, is providing "a service to clients who don't want to sell just their fabulous oil paintings," says Villa Grisebach's Vivien Reuter. 
20/wsj_2055:Instead of banning such shopping, the confederation proposed amending controls to be sure the privilege isn't abused. . . . British and Argentine diplomats opened talks in Madrid aimed at restoring ties severed because of their 1982 war over the Falkland Islands.
20/wsj_2056:Polaroid Corp., benefiting from staff-reduction savings, reported a strong gain in third-quarter operating results and net income of $29.9 million, or 40 cents a share, after preferred-stock requirements. 
20/wsj_2056:Analysts said the numbers were better than expectations, partly because of strong profit margins and a positive foreign-currency translation.
20/wsj_2056:However, they said the company's flat revenue was a disappointment, and an indication that sales of Polaroid's new conventional film in the U.S. have been sluggish.
20/wsj_2056:Polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of $63.1 million for the third quarter, more than double the year-before $24 million.
20/wsj_2056:Charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of $54.1 million, or 77 cents a share, in 1988's third quarter. 
20/wsj_2056:"I'm somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand" for Polaroid products, said Michael Ellmann, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co. "If you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue, there isn't a lot here to base optimism on." Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache, says Polaroid officials told him yesterday that U.S. sales of the company's new conventional film product, introduced in the second quarter, have been "disappointing" after a promising start. 
20/wsj_2056:Sam Yanes, a Polaroid spokesman, said "I don't know about disappointing," but added that the company hasn't been able to get the product on the shelves of some mass-merchandise, discount retailers that it had hoped would be carrying the product already.
20/wsj_2056:For the nine months, Polaroid reported earnings of $98.5 million, or $1.27 a share.
20/wsj_2056:Last year, the company had a nine-month loss of $15.1 million, or 23 cents a share. 
20/wsj_2057:Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average did a now familiar dance: It plunged 60.25 points before lunch, with most of the drop occurring in 25 minutes.
20/wsj_2057:"It's madness -- that in an hour you can whack off so much value," says Stanford Calderwood, chairman of Trinity Investment Management Corp., Boston. 
20/wsj_2057:But most are linked by a single theme: liquidity -- the ability to get in and out of the market quickly. 
20/wsj_2057:"Institutions are herding animals," says Peter Anderson, who heads the pension-fund management arm of IDS Financial Services Inc. "We watch the same indicators and listen to the same prognosticators.
20/wsj_2057:Institutions -- who now account for most trading -- count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an eye-blink.
20/wsj_2057:Investors believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks; that is, a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks. 
20/wsj_2057:These and other modern trading methods "tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets," says George Douglas, first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "It's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy" -- so that bouts of higher volatility get built into the stock market. 
20/wsj_2057:For instance, First Quadrant Corp., an asset allocator based in Morristown, N.J., said it quickly boosted stock positions in its "aggressive" accounts to 75% from 55% to take advantage of plunging prices Friday.
20/wsj_2057:A classic example of institutions' hunger for liquidity is portfolio insurance, now widely discredited.
20/wsj_2057:The idea was to "insure" the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped -- eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves.
20/wsj_2057:Yet even today, institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets.
20/wsj_2057:Others are doing "index arbitrage"a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures. 
20/wsj_2057:Unlike traditional buy-and-hold strategies, all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch.
20/wsj_2057:Wall Street traders say that, with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the 1970s, securities firms can't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock. "I think everyone's a little more leery," says Jack Baker, head of equity trading at Shearon Lehman Hutton Inc. "The institutions have driven (commission) rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit capital," says Tom Gallagher, senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at Oppenheimer & Co. "Why should I risk money for a guy for who's paying me five cents a dance?
20/wsj_2057:Lack of liquidity can also result from exchange "reforms." Many traders say that "circuit breakers" put in place to damp volatility after the 1987 crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged Friday.
20/wsj_2057:"It was like they put you in a room with a gorilla and told you there were three doors to exit," said one Chicago-based futures trader. "Then they said, `By the way, two of the doors are locked. '" 
20/wsj_2057:Scott Black, a value-oriented money manager who heads Delphi Management Inc., points out that for those who invest on fundamentals, "the value of a stock from day to day doesn't change all that much." 
20/wsj_2057:Hans Stoll, finance professor at Vanderbilt University, says the current volatility in U.S. markets pales in comparison to the 1930s, decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced. "I just can't believe that the innovations in the financial market are causing any of this volatility," he says. 
20/wsj_2057:And Robert D. Arnott, president of asset allocator First Quadrant, notes that before Friday's tailspin, daily volatility on the New York Stock Exchange in recent weeks had reached "historically low levels." 
20/wsj_2057:John J. Phelan Jr., chairman of the Big Board, asserts that "1988 and 1989 have been two of the least volatile years in the last 30 or 40 years." 
20/wsj_2057:But the low average volatility Mr. Phelan is talking about isn't any comfort in a period of rapid stock-market moves like the past week.
20/wsj_2057:In addition, Sanford Grossman, a Wharton School finance professor, says volatile jumps in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the voracious demands of institutions "who can go out and say `I have a billion dollars of stocks to sell. '" 
20/wsj_2057:In 1936, John Maynard Keynes wrote that "of the maxims of orthodox finance none, surely, is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity." It leads investors to focus on short-term price movements -- "a game of musical chairs," he called it -- rather than on long-term fundamental valuation. 
20/wsj_2058:The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its Galileo space probe, which is to be launched today. 
20/wsj_2058:Charles Redmond, a NASA spokesman, said the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected 100 university centers to be infected by today.
20/wsj_2058:Although the network isn't connected to the computer systems that operate either Galileo or the shuttle, part of the network will carry analyses of Galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn. 
20/wsj_2058:In the lingo of computer security, the NASA intruder is technically a computer worm, Mr. Redmond said.
20/wsj_2058:A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks.
20/wsj_2058:NASA said the Galileo worm hadn't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject worms.
20/wsj_2058:If it finds one and gets into the system, it will display a screen when a user logs on that says, "Worms Against Nuclear Killers. . . . You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war." 
20/wsj_2058:If it finds one of those passwords, Mr. Alexander said, the worm will do such things as change users' passwords to a series of random numbers, preventing them from signing on to the network. 
20/wsj_2058:NASA said it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the 6,000 connected to Internet were affected and the extent of the damage, if any. 
20/wsj_2058:Anti-nuclear activists have protested the launch of the Galileo space probe to Jupiter because it uses plutonium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft.
20/wsj_2058:Activists fear that if the shuttle carrying Galileo into orbit should explode, or if Galileo itself crashes into the Earth during the two times it flies close to the planet, fatal levels of plutonium would be released into the atmosphere. 
20/wsj_2058:So far Galileo has been delayed twice, once because of a computer malfunction connected with a space-shuttle engine, and yesterday because of the weather.
20/wsj_2058:Mr. Alexander of Computerworld said hackers have gone after SPAN before.
20/wsj_2058:He said the Chaos Computer Club, of West Germany, once managed to invade SPAN and do such things as change the value of pi, messing up some calculations. 
20/wsj_2059:Hudson and Goodwin, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal, while well established in British law, would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers. 
20/wsj_2059:In practice, however, the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began to blur.
20/wsj_2059:In particular, a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade.
20/wsj_2059:Consider the facts underlying the 1989 conviction of Robert Chestman. 
20/wsj_2059:Prior to a tender offer by A&P for Waldbaum Inc. in 1986, the founder of the Waldbaum's supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery.
20/wsj_2059:Hearing of this information, the husband discussed it with his broker, Mr. Chestman, and Mr. Chestman then bought for his own account and other clients.
20/wsj_2059:A second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by Robert Freeman, formerly head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Co. Essentially, Mr. Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy-out, when he was told by another prominent trader, Bernard "Bunny" Lasker, that the deal was in trouble.
20/wsj_2059:The illegal "tip" of the bunny's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market.
20/wsj_2059:Did Mr. Freeman have notice of this?
20/wsj_2059:It is not my contention that either Mr. Chestman or Mr. Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness.
20/wsj_2059:But even if they behaved recklessly, reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case-by-case judicial extension of the law of insider trading. 
20/wsj_2059:Courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors.
20/wsj_2059:After-the-fact judicial examination of an actor's conduct has always been the common law's method.
20/wsj_2059:When only civil liability is involved, this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization.
20/wsj_2059:Still, case-by-case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a fixation on ad hoc (and usually sleazy) examples.
20/wsj_2059:When a court decides that a particular actor's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct, it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule. 
20/wsj_2059:Thus, a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule.
20/wsj_2059:For example, in focusing on Mr. Freeman's attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal's collapse, one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin: What if the rumor had been false?
20/wsj_2059:In this light, the comparative advantages of legislative law-making become clear: (1) Before it acts, the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision, not just the immediate parties before the court; and (2) the legislature can frame "bright line" standards that create less uncertainty than the fact-bound decisions of courts. 
20/wsj_2059:Although legislative lines can result in under-inclusion (which explains why the SEC has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading), judicial lawmaking inevitably creates uncertainty because of the shadowy outer edges and implications of most judicial decisions.
20/wsj_2059:The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime.
20/wsj_2059:U.S. to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues.
20/wsj_2059:Yet, late last year, Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of "the intangible right of honest services." At a stroke, this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches (and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee). 
20/wsj_2060:The year-earlier figure included a one-time gain of $59.9 million from the sale of Corning's stakes in Japanese businesses.
20/wsj_2060:The telecommunications, specialty glass, ceramic products and laboratory-services concern said the latest quarter included a tax-loss carry-forward of $600,000.
20/wsj_2060:As for joint ventures, Mr. Houghton said profit was "essentially flat" due primarily to a slow recovery at Samsung-Corning Co. in Korea following a strike at a major customer and the disruption of shipments to China.
20/wsj_2060:Also, profit was hurt by the strength of the dollar overseas which negatively affected the company's currency-exchange rate. 
20/wsj_2061:Within 10 minutes after an 11:13 a.m. trading halt in UAL, parent of United Airlines, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 27 points to a 60.25-point deficit.
20/wsj_2061:The stock tumbled 24 7/8 to 198 on volume of 2.8 million shares. 
20/wsj_2061:UAL, which is trying to reconstruct a buy-out bid that banks wouldn't finance, represents the future of one of the most powerful ingredients in the bull market-corporate restructuring.
20/wsj_2061:An important element of this phenomenon -- the now-shaky market for junk bonds, used often to finance restructurings and takeovers -- continued to cast a pall over stocks. 
20/wsj_2061:"It was a very nervous day," said John Geary, partner of the Big Board specialist firm Ziebarth, Geary. 
20/wsj_2061:This Friday brings the "double witching hour," Wall Street's nickname for the monthly simultaneous expiration of a variety of stock index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.
20/wsj_2061:Previous monthly expirations of the Major Market Index futures and Standard & Poor's 100-stock index options have produced spectacular volatility. 
20/wsj_2061:"We are in one of those phases where you are going to get a lot of volatile expiration action," said Donald Selkin, head of stock-index research at Prudential-Bache Securities. 
20/wsj_2061:Investors "are buying stocks that have predictable earnings," said Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at Kidder Peabody. 
20/wsj_2061:Along the way, investors dumped takeover stocks and shares of banks that have leveraged-buy-out debt and risky real estate loans on their books. 
20/wsj_2061:"These loans are more of a focus than lesser-developed-country debt now," said William Bee, senior block trader at Prudential-Bache Securities. 
20/wsj_2061:In the first hour of trading, about one million shares a minute changed hands on the Big Board as big stock-index arbitrage sell programs pushed prices lower. (In stock-index arbitrage, traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks against offsetting positions in futures.) Traders said many of the sell programs are positions being established ahead of this Friday's expiration. 
20/wsj_2061:AMR, the parent of American Airlines, continued to retreat in the wake of New York developer Donald Trump's decision to withdraw his $120-a-share takeover bid.
20/wsj_2061:But Texas Air, the owner of Continental and Eastern airlines, bucked the group's decline by rising 7/8 to 14 5/8 in American Stock Exchange trading.
20/wsj_2061:Eastern said it is ahead of schedule in resuming its operations after filing earlier this year for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, from which it expects to emerge early next year. 
20/wsj_2061:Among the three worst-performing groups, with declines of 10% to 20%, are airlines, casinos and securities brokers. 
20/wsj_2061:The Nasdaq composite index closed down 1.05 to 459.93 on volume of 161.5 million shares. "The environment is a lot more trading-oriented," said Gary Rosenbach, manager of equity trading at the OTC stock firm Needham & Co. in New York. "Because there is a lot more volatility now, if guys see that they can make a quick 10% or 15% profit, they'll take it." 
20/wsj_2061:The British company plans to change its name to Manpower, the name of its U.S. unit, and write off part of nearly $1.2 billion in good will as a possible prelude to reincorporating in the U.S. 
20/wsj_2061:Shearson Lehman Hutton began its coverage of the company with favorable ratings. 
20/wsj_2061:Among active Amex issues, the American depositary receipts of B.A.T Industries fell 1/4 to 11 3/4 on turnover of 885,800.
20/wsj_2061:Investment bankers and retailers said the turmoil on Wall Street may benefit managers who plan to bid for U.S. retailing units of the British firm because takeover prices may not be as high as before the recent correction. 
20/wsj_2061:Fruit of the Loom slipped 1/8 to 12 3/8 on 501,200 shares.
20/wsj_2061:The biggest percentage gainer on the Amex was Enviropact, which jumped 23%, or 5/8, to 3 3/8 on volume of 29,000 shares.
20/wsj_2061:On Monday, the company, a provider of environmental consulting services, reported a wider fiscal fourth-quarter loss and predicted a loss for its fiscal 1990 first quarter, but said a profit is expected for all of fiscal 1990.
20/wsj_2062:ONE LIBERTY PROPERTIES Inc. declared a dividend of 40 cents a share on its $16.50 cumulative convertible preferred stock, payable Jan. 2 to stock of record Dec. 8.
20/wsj_2062:But directors of the Great Neck, N.Y., real estate investment trust didn't act on the common stock dividend.
20/wsj_2062:And they won't consider such a dividend, the trust added, before results are available for the first quarter of 1990.
20/wsj_2062:According to a spokesman, One Liberty will have paid out as dividends the required amount of its taxable income to maintain its legal status as a real estate investment trust. 
20/wsj_2063:Yields on small-denomination certificates of deposit fell at about half the rate of so-called jumbo CDs this week, according to Banxquote Money Markets, an information service based here.
20/wsj_2063:Investors can get slightly higher yields on deposits below $50,000 than they can on deposits of $90,000 and up. 
20/wsj_2063:"Banks want to remain competitive," said Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote. "October is a big rollover month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand . . . among people leaving the stock market." 
20/wsj_2063:Chemical said deposits Monday were about $5 million higher than usual and it expects more activity as investors receive the proceeds from sales of stock. 
20/wsj_2063:Friday's market rout came smack in the middle of the heaviest month for CD rollovers, when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way.
20/wsj_2063:First National Bank of Boston, for example, is offering certain new depositors an extra quarter of a percentage point on six-month and 12-month CDs. 
20/wsj_2063:On average, however, three-month CDs at major banks are yielding a tenth of a percentage point less than they were a week ago. 
20/wsj_2063:Six-month CDs of $50,000 and less yielded an average 8.02% in the week ended Tuesday, down from 8.10%, according to Banxquote.
20/wsj_2063:Meanwhile, the average yield on six-month CDs of more than $90,000 fell to 7.93% in the latest week, according to Banxquote, from 8.10% the week before.
20/wsj_2063:A six-month, broker-sold CD, for example, was yielding an average 8.09% in the latest week, a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before.
20/wsj_2063:CD yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks. "What happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit" reported yesterday "make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise" any time soon, said Mr. Mehl of Banxquote. 
20/wsj_2064:At the recent meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, the Bush administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the IMF's capital base.
20/wsj_2064:While the U.S. share of the increase probably will not reach the $12 billion or more implicit in the IMF's request for a doubling of its $90 billion capital, the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase.
20/wsj_2064:Its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s.
20/wsj_2064:The size and pace of disbursements will accelerate further under the Brady Plan, which promises larger and earlier disbursements to approved countries. 
20/wsj_2064:Opponents of the increase argue that the IMF practices central planning while supporting ineffective governments.
20/wsj_2064:They question whether the IMF has any role in developing countries, given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in balance-of-payments emergencies. 
20/wsj_2064:They worry that new IMF funding of developing countries will simply end up substituting IMF debt for reschedulable commercial bank debt, a bad trade all around.
20/wsj_2064:They believe microeconomics, which addresses the problems of markets, investment climate and management practices, is the key to developing-country growth, not the IMF's Keynesian focus on trade deficits, quarterly targets and government debt.
20/wsj_2064:The politics of the 1990 congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous authorizations.
20/wsj_2064:Liberals may support the stabilizing, quasi-governmental role of the IMF on two conditions: that the administration give assurances that liberal Democrats' support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns; and that the legislation address -- with dollars -- social and environmental concerns.
20/wsj_2064:Conservative Republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party's popular president in an election year. 
20/wsj_2064:Commentators would fret over the implications for the G-7 coordination process and the stability of world financial markets.
20/wsj_2064:Because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase, a scaled-down IMF mission would leave both feeling shortchanged.
20/wsj_2064:Furthermore, a U.S. rejection of the capital increase (and transfer of shares to Japan) would give Japan an argument against future calls for economic burden-sharing. 
20/wsj_2064:On the other hand, a decision to increase the IMF's capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral institutions in developing countries.
20/wsj_2064:Upping the ante could slow economic development even further, as countries delay market-opening steps in anticipation of richer multilateral support. 
20/wsj_2064:The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase, rather than its purpose.
20/wsj_2064:Mr. Malpass directs the Republican staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. 
20/wsj_2065:The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused of making prearranged trades with each other that allegedly cheated a customer. 
20/wsj_2065:Merc officials said Gary N. Roberts was disciplined following the exchange's investigation of his trading in several commodities pits from July to November 1988.
20/wsj_2065:Also, he and Mr. Stein were ordered to make restitution of $35,000 to a customer. 
20/wsj_2065:The Merc said that as part of the disciplinary settlement, neither man admitted, nor denied the alleged violations.
20/wsj_2065:Neither was among the 46 traders indicted last August in a federal investigation of traders at both the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade. 
20/wsj_2066:In a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to Time Warner Inc. 's powerful Home Box Office, cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. agreed to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. from Viacom Inc. for $225 million. 
20/wsj_2066:The purchase comes after nearly three years of on-again off-again talks between TCI and Viacom, which has also discussed the sale of an interest in Showtime with other cable operators.
20/wsj_2066:For TCI, the investment in Showtime puts it in an unusual position; as the largest cable operator, with control of close to 12 million of the nation's 52 million cable subscribers, TCI is HBO's largest customer.
20/wsj_2066:But TCI President John Malone has long been concerned about HBO's dominance of the pay TV business, and has been eager to keep Showtime as a healthy competitor. "It is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay-television marketplace," Mr. Malone said in a statement. 
20/wsj_2066:In a telephone interview, Robert Thomson, TCI senior vice president, said Showtime's suit against HBO "doesn't involve us, and nothing we're doing here bears any relationship to that." He added, "We don't intend to be drawn into it," noting that TCI won't play any active role in the management of Showtime. 
20/wsj_2066:In addition to owning HBO, Time Warner owns American Television & Communications Inc., the nation's second largest cable operator after TCI. Viacom also owns cable systems, but it is the 14th largest operator of such systems, with less than one million subscribers. 
20/wsj_2066:The TCI investment is a big victory for Viacom's chief executive officer, Frank Biondi, and Winston H. Cox, president of the Showtime unit. "This takes any question of Showtime's viability and puts it away once and for all," Mr. Biondi said in a telephone interview. 
20/wsj_2066:The fight between HBO and Showtime is particularly acrimonious because Mr. Biondi is the former chief executive of HBO, and Mr. Cox served as chief of marketing for the service.
20/wsj_2066:They were both hired by Sumner Redstone, the Boston billionaire who took control of Viacom three years ago in a leveraged buy-out. 
20/wsj_2066:Time Warner has vigorously denied all of Viacom's allegations. 
20/wsj_2067:Meanwhile, a federal mediator is scheduled to meet today with Boeing officials and representatives of 55,000 striking Machinists. 
20/wsj_2067:"It will take several meetings to resolve this," said a spokesman for the Machinists union. "We don't want to bring back something the members will reject." Machinists already have rejected a package that would have provided a 10% pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract.
20/wsj_2068:It wasn't clear, however, whether the actions were related to a battle between the corporate raider and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint Corp., a San Antonio, Texas-based data-processing systems maker. 
20/wsj_2068:After Mr. Ackerman announced he was soliciting consents from shareholders in order to wrest control of Datapoint from Mr. Edelman, the corporate raider purchased 30% of Datapoint's shares. 
20/wsj_2068:In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Edelman said from Sept. 29 to Oct. 13, he acquired 309,500 shares of Intelogic common shares for $2.25 to $2.375 each.
20/wsj_2068:The purchases increased his stake to 16.2% of the shares outstanding. 
20/wsj_2068:The filing also said certain provisions which apply to persons acquiring 20% or more of Intelogic common stock, were waived by Intelogic for Mr. Edelman, who is chairman of the company.
20/wsj_2069:The federal government should make free, voluntary testing for the AIDS virus the cornerstone of an expanded campaign to stop the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the Hudson Institute recommended. 
20/wsj_2069:The report takes a more alarmed view of AIDS and recommends a more sweeping response than many other analyses.
20/wsj_2069:It warns that the AIDS epidemic "may reduce the rate of growth of the work force, curb productivity gains and slow economic growth." 
20/wsj_2069:It contends that current government policy is failing to stem the AIDS epidemic because it suggests the use of condoms can make sex "safe." But the report says: "The only safe sex is sex between uninfected partners," and testing is the only way to learn of infection. 
20/wsj_2069:Hudson's researchers estimated that it would cost less than $650 million a year to test the entire population between the ages of 12 and 65 years old.
20/wsj_2070:Soon after the release of the U.S. trade figures, the dollar plunged to an intraday low of 140.95 yen.
20/wsj_2070:It also declined against the mark but didn't reach its intraday low of 1.8435 marks until two hours later. 
20/wsj_2070:Dealers noted that the foreign exchange market's initial bearish reaction to the U.S. trade figures was tempered later by a "calmer reassessment of the data." 
20/wsj_2070:The U.S. Commerce Department reported a $10.77 billion deficit in August, compared with a revised July deficit of $8.24 billion.
20/wsj_2070:Later, the U.S. currency fell to about 142.25 yen on news reports of the San Francisco earthquake. 
20/wsj_2070:Some analysts remain bullish and point out that the dollar continues to be well bid despite key rate increases in Europe and Japan, several weeks of aggressive dollar sales by the world central banks -- some traders estimate that the barrage of sales topped $12 billion -- and a 190-point plunge on the New York Stock Exchange. 
20/wsj_2070:They note that the U.S. unit is trading at the upper end of the presumed target zones established by the Group of Seven trading partners.
20/wsj_2070:The so-called Louvre accord was seen to have set ranges of 1.70 marks to 1.90 marks and 120 yen to 140 yen. 
20/wsj_2070:They say that the recent injection of liquidity into the U.S. banking system has been modest, and they don't anticipate significant easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
20/wsj_2070:The Fed arranged $1.5 billion of customer repurchase agreements Tuesday, the second repurchase agreement in two days. 
20/wsj_2070:They add that the Fed has allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5/8% from its levels of just below 9% last week.
20/wsj_2071:Linear Technology, Milpitas, Calif., called the settlement "positive," since products covered by the disputed patents account for about 20% of its annual sales. 
20/wsj_2071:The electronics concern said it already has paid $2 million of the settlement to National Semiconductor, Santa Clara, Calif., and will pay the remaining $1 million in equal installments over the next eight quarters.
20/wsj_2072:The National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., had its record-breaking 68-week reign as the prime-time ratings leader snapped yesterday by ABC-TV, a subsidiary of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
20/wsj_2072:NBC was second with a 13.9 rating and 24 share followed by CBS Inc. 's television network with a 12.5 rating and 21 share. (A ratings point represents 904,000 television households; shares indicate the percentage of sets in use.) 
20/wsj_2072:The first two games of the World Series between the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants didn't finish in the top 10; instead they landed in 16th and 18th place.
20/wsj_2072:The highest-rated show continues to be ABC's "Roseanne." NBC had five of the top 10 shows; ABC had four and CBS had one. 
20/wsj_2073:Procter & Gamble Co., Cincinnati, expanding its presence in the food service market, said it acquired Maryland Club Foods, a coffee supplier, from an investor group led by F. Philip Handy of Winter Park, Fla.
20/wsj_2073:Houston-based Maryland Club Foods, which had sales of about $200 million last year, sells coffee under the Maryland Club and Butter-Nut brands to restaurants, hotels, offices and airlines.
20/wsj_2074:MACMILLAN BLOEDEL Ltd. said it borrowed 215 million Dutch guilders (US$102 million) from a group of Dutch institutional investors.
20/wsj_2075:President Bush will veto a bill funding the Departments of Labor, Education and Health and Human Services because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest, the White House said. 
20/wsj_2075:Mr. Bush has said he personally approves of abortions in the cases of rape, incest and danger to the life of the mother.
20/wsj_2075:But he has opposed Medicaid funding of abortions for poor women who say they are victims of rape and incest, arguing that those exceptions are enforced so loosely that they open the way for abortions for other women. 
20/wsj_2076:NEWSPAPERS: Media General Inc. intends to sell two of its West Coast weekly newspaper chains, Golden West Publishing Inc. and Highlander Publications, which together comprise 31 papers.
20/wsj_2077:J.P. Morgan & Co., New York, will help the statutory managers of DFC New Zealand Ltd. to evaluate the failed investment bank's condition. 
20/wsj_2077:Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the country's central bank, appointed the managers to run the investment bank and pay creditors.
20/wsj_2077:DFC asked the central bank to appoint managers after it revised loan-loss provisions to around the same level of shareholders' funds of 180 million New Zealand dollars (US$105.4 million). 
20/wsj_2077:DFC is held 80% by National Provident Fund, New Zealand's largest pension fund, and 20% by Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment-bank and securities-firm subsidiary of Salomon Inc. in New York. 
20/wsj_2077:A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan, parent of the bank Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., confirmed its appointment to assist the managers but declined to elaborate. 
20/wsj_2078:An experimental vaccine can alter the immune response of people infected with the AIDS virus, a prominent U.S. scientist said. 
20/wsj_2078:Its effectiveness can't be determined until a large clinical trial is undertaken by the Army in January, according to Robert Redfield, chief of acquired immune deficiency syndrome research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. 
20/wsj_2078:Dr. Redfield's report on early experiments using an AIDS vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of West Haven, Conn., came at a meeting of AIDS vaccine researchers in Florida late Monday.
20/wsj_2078:The vaccine, VaxSyn HIV-1, has been safely given to 14 people, some of whom are experiencing substantial increases in certain antibodies. 
20/wsj_2078:"The conventional wisdom used to be that you couldn't modify the immune response of an infected individual" by innoculating them with synthetic viral proteins, Dr. Redfield said. "We've demonstrated that you can." 
20/wsj_2078:He said certain volunteers developed kinds of antibodies associated with early AIDS. Other antibodies sparked by the preparation are of a sort rarely present in large quantities in infected or ill individuals, he added.
20/wsj_2078:One of the mysteries of AIDS remains why infected people produce large quantities of antibodies, but deteriorate nonetheless. 
20/wsj_2079:Cross & Trecker Corp. said it reached an agreement to sell its Wiedemann division to recently created Murata Wiedemann Inc., a U.S. affiliate of Murata Machinery Ltd. of Kyoto, Japan. 
20/wsj_2079:The agreement also includes the purchase of Cross & Trecker's Warner & Swasey (Switzerland) AG unit by a European affiliate of Murata Machinery.
20/wsj_2079:Cross & Trecker, a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., machine-tool maker, said the net sales price of the total transaction is $24 million.
20/wsj_2079:The Wiedemann division was one of three businesses put up for sale in Cross & Trecker's restructuring program announced in July.
20/wsj_2079:Cross & Trecker said negotiations are under way for the sale of another company, RobertsCorp. 
20/wsj_2080:The average interest rate fell to 8.292% at Citicorp's $50 million weekly auction of 91-day commercial paper, or corporate IOUs, from 8.483% at last week's sale. 
20/wsj_2080:Citicorp also said that the average rate fell to 7.986% at its $50 million auction of 182-day commercial paper from 8.1255% at last week's sale. 
20/wsj_2080:The bank holding company will auction another $50 million of commercial paper in each maturity next Tuesday. 
20/wsj_2081:Matra S.A. reported its 1989 first-half profit soared 88%, and indicated that its previous estimate of a 50% rise in earnings for all of 1989 will be exceeded by a wide margin. 
20/wsj_2081:The French electronics and defense group said attributable consolidated net profit for the first six months of 1989 totaled 244 million francs ($38.4 million), compared with 130 million francs ($20.5 million) in the corresponding period of 
20/wsj_2081:Operating profit climbed 51%, to 572 million francs from 378 million in the first half of 1988. 
20/wsj_2081:Matra said the sharp improvement in net profit partly reflected a decline of 59 million francs in the group's net loss from nonrecurring items in the first half of this year to 104 million francs from 163 million a year earlier.
20/wsj_2081:These movements were offset, however, by a steep rise in corporate income tax payments to 199 million francs from 35 million in the first six months of 1988. 
20/wsj_2082:Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) said he and Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) are backing away from their proposal to make the Treasury Secretary a voting member of the Federal Reserve panel that sets monetary policy. 
20/wsj_2082:Rep. Hamilton said the bill will be modified substantially to call for two meetings each year between the Fed's open market committee and the Treasury Secretary, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
20/wsj_2082:The original bill was strongly opposed by the Fed and publicly criticized by friends of the Fed as an attempt to undermine the central bank's independence.
20/wsj_2082:Fed critics, however, hailed it as a long overdue attempt to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy. 
20/wsj_2082:Rep. Hamilton said the purpose of the meetings would be to "improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed." 
20/wsj_2082:Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan meets regularly for lunch with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and talks frequently with Budget Director Richard Darman and Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
20/wsj_2082:The administration officials don't ordinarily meet with the entire membership of the open market committee. 
20/wsj_2083:B.F. Goodrich Co. said third-quarter profits dropped 34% because of lower prices for polyvinyl chloride materials, the company's largest product group. 
20/wsj_2083:The plastic resin is used in a wide range of products, including siding, pipe and electrical wire insulation. 
20/wsj_2083:Goodrich's vinyl-products segment reported operating profit for the quarter of $30.1 million, less than half the $64.1 million of the year-earlier quarter.

20/wsj_2084:A., Italy's leading industrial group, is conducting "concrete" talks with West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG on a series of projects in the aerospace sector, Fiat officials said. 
20/wsj_2084:However, the officials said it was too early to disclose the nature of the proposed projects or indicate when the talks might be concluded. 
20/wsj_2084:In the interview, Mr. Reuter said he is thinking foremost of cooperation in the truck sector, but "in the long run, I don't want to rule out that we can also come a bit closer in personal cars." 
20/wsj_2084:Roberto Morelli, Italy analyst for County Natwest Securities in London, said that right now "the market isn't being influenced by that kind of news," referring to the conditional nature of the talks mentioned by Mr. Reuter and by the uncertainty surrounding world stock exchanges this week. 
20/wsj_2085:Paul Tanner was named president, chief executive officer and chairman of this oil and natural gas company.
20/wsj_2085:Mr. Tanner had been president of Penn Pacific's National Southwest Capital Group subsidiary.
20/wsj_2085:Mr. Boudreau will remain with Penn Pacific as a director and a member of the executive committee.
20/wsj_2085:He has also agreed to become president of a new subsidiary to be formed to make future acquisitions, the company said. 
20/wsj_2086:That's the view of some analysts here who argue that Britain's leading maker of luxury cars still may have two U.S. auto giants battling for it. 
20/wsj_2086:A victor in the fight for Jaguar may not emerge until after the expiration late next year of British government takeover restrictions.
20/wsj_2086:The curbs prevent a buyer from purchasing more than 15% of Jaguar shares without permission. "This is an exceptionally odd takeover battle," says London analyst Christopher Will of Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
20/wsj_2086:Jaguar's American depositary receipts were up 3/8 yesterday in a down market, closing at 10 3/8. (Jaguar's ADRs make the company one of the most widely held United Kingdom stocks in the U.S., with more than one-fourth of its shares owned there.) 
20/wsj_2086:Ford's share purchases undoubtedly accounted for much of Monday's heavy trading. 
20/wsj_2086:GM is expected to inject roughly #200 million ($316 million) by acquiring some Jaguar shares, and then win Jaguar management's promise of an eventual 30% stake.
20/wsj_2086:Analysts believe the car makers also will create joint ventures to develop new executive models, doubling Jaguar's yearly output of 50,000 cars. 
20/wsj_2086:Ford might challenge the proposal by offering a full bid if holders and the U.K. government agreed to drop the anti-takeover barrier early. "I think Ford is going to come out with full guns blazing," Mr. Reitman says. "Ford wants {Jaguar} very much." U.S. takeover-stock speculators, who may own between 20% and 30% of Jaguar, could give Ford enough votes to block the GM deal. 
20/wsj_2086:"There's quite a bit of value left in the {Jaguar} shares here even though they have run up" lately, says Doug Johnson, a fund manager for Seattle-based Safeco Asset Management.
20/wsj_2086:He thinks Saab-Scania AB on Friday will announce the sale of 50% of its car division to Ford; the companies have been discussing closer cooperation for months. 
20/wsj_2086:Clifford Stahl, president and chief investment officer of C-S Capital Advisors Inc., two weeks ago sold his Cincinnati firm's 107,100 Jaguar ADRs at about 10 each, making a tidy profit on a holding purchased at 4 7/8 in early May. "I thought the probabilities of {a bidding war} happening were less," he says.
20/wsj_2086:Of course, that was before Ford's latest move. 
20/wsj_2087:A.F. Sloan, 60 years old, announced that he will retire next April as chairman and chief executive officer of this snack food and bakery products maker.
20/wsj_2088:Newport Electronics Inc. of Santa Ana, Calif., said Milton B. Hollander, who holds a 49.4% stake, requested a special shareholders' meeting next Wednesday to remove four current directors and elect an alternative slate. 
20/wsj_2088:Mr. Hollander's High Technology Holding Co. of Stamford, Conn., acquired most of its stake last August in an $11-a-share tender offer for Newport, a maker of electronic-measuring devices. 
20/wsj_2088:The board isn't proposing a slate of its own and the other four current directors don't want to serve beyond the special meeting date, Newport said. 
20/wsj_2089:Sandoz AG, a major Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, said that its group sales rose 25% to 9.482 billion francs ($5.80 billion) in the first nine months of this year, with strong gains in all divisions. 
20/wsj_2090:Amstrad PLC, a British maker of computer hardware and communications equipment, posted a 52% plunge in pretax profit for the latest year. 
20/wsj_2090:The #76.6 million ($120.6 million) in pretax profit for the 12 months to June 30 was down from #160 million ($252 million) a year earlier and below market expectations of #80 million and #90 million. 
20/wsj_2091:Microsoft Corp. 's earnings growth continued to outstrip that of most of its competitors and customers in the personal-computer industry, as it reported a 36% jump in fiscal first-quarter earnings on a 33% revenue gain. 
20/wsj_2091:The Redmond, Wash. company, a bellwether provider of operating systems and software for personal-computer makers and users, reported net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 of $49.6 million, or 87 cents a share, up from $36.6 million, or 65 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
20/wsj_2091:The stock had hit a high of $81 a share early last week but collapsed to $73.50 in the Friday stock plunge. 
20/wsj_2091:The company had been experiencing softening margins because of increased sales of software applications, which have lower margins than do operating systems.
20/wsj_2091:But the company said that trend was offset in the first quarter by better economies of scale and efficiencies in manufacturing. 
20/wsj_2091:As a result, Microsoft's cost of goods, as a percentage of sales, fell 17% from the year-ago quarter and 13% from the previous period.
20/wsj_2091:The trend drove up the aftertax margin -- net income as a percentage of revenues -- to 21.1% in the quarter, compared with 20.7% a year earlier. 
20/wsj_2091:While it has predicted that overall growth in unit sales of personal computers is slowing to about a 10% yearly rate, its own products are selling at a much faster rate because many are geared to the high-performance end of the market.
20/wsj_2091:That segment continues to post strong quarter-to-quarter gains, while the low-end, or commodity segment, of the industry is experiencing sluggish growth or even sales declines. 
20/wsj_2091:Compared with its previous quarter, the final period of its 1989 fiscal year, net rose 9%, and sales rose 7%. 
20/wsj_2092:Control Data also said it is developing what it called a "supermainframe" computer, the Cyber 2000, intended for scientists, engineers and other users of generalpurpose high-performance computers. 
20/wsj_2093:UAL'S STOCK SKIDDED an additional $24.875, to $198, as British Airways indicated it may balk at any hastily revised version of the aborted $6.79 billion buy-out of United Air's parent.
20/wsj_2093:UAL has fallen $87.25, or 31%, in the three trading days since disclosure of the buy-out's collapse jolted the stock market.
20/wsj_2093:An analyst called it one of the worst trade reports since the dollar bottomed out in 
20/wsj_2093:Bank of New England plans to sell some operations and lay off 4% of its work force after a year of weak earnings and mounting loan problems. 
20/wsj_2093:Tele-Communications agreed to buy half of Showtime Networks from Viacom for $225 million.
20/wsj_2093:FDIC Chairman Seidman said that Lincoln Savings & Loan of California should have been seized in 1986 to contain losses he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion. 
20/wsj_2093:The deficit-reduction bill became snagged over efforts to streamline the House version of the legislation in advance of a House-Senate conference. 
20/wsj_2093:Integrated Resources said talks have ended with another potential buyer of its core businesses. 
20/wsj_2094:Paul Ely, general partner of Alpha Partners, a venture-capital firm based in Menlo Park, Calif., was named a director of this computer company.
20/wsj_2095:It has since asked holders not to immediately tender their shares under a recent $72-a-share, or $104 million, bid from AB SKF of Sweden, until McGill directors have completed their evaluation. 
20/wsj_2095:BroadBeach didn't identify the buyer of the shares, but the date of the selloff followed by one day the Swedish concern's tender offer, and the indicated price of the shares sold equals SKF's $72-a-share tender offer price. 
20/wsj_2096:Luis Nogales, 45 years old, has been elected to the board of this brewer.
20/wsj_2096:Mr. Nogales, former president of United Press International and the Univision Spanish-language network, most recently co-founded Nogales Castro Partners, a California-based media acquisition firm.
20/wsj_2097:The Paris-based group said its earlier projection -- that group profit for all of 1989 would be close to the 322.7 million francs posted for 1988 -- remains valid. 
20/wsj_2097:Taking into account nonrecurring gains and losses, Hachette's group net income for the first six months of this year totaled 246.6 million francs, practically double the year-earlier figure of 124.5 million francs. 
20/wsj_2097:Analysts said Hachette's earnings in the second half might be boosted by a capital gain from the sale of the Paris headquarters of a newspaper-delivery company that is 49% owned by Hachette. 
20/wsj_2098:Oncor Inc., Gaithersburg, Md., said it received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market a genetic test that will assist in diagnosis and treatment of leukemia and lymph cancer. 
20/wsj_2098:The B/T gene rearrangement test is more accurate than existing tests for diagnosing the type of cancer, whether it has spread or whether there is a recurrence following treatment, said Oncor President Stephen Turner.
20/wsj_2098:Oncor, a six-year-old developer of genetic medical tests, projects that the cancer test will help it to post its first-ever profit during the first quarter of 1990, Mr. Turner said.
20/wsj_2098:The company will charge $35 for a test and projects about $2 million in revenue from the test during the first 12 months of marketing, he said. 
20/wsj_2099:Unilab Corp., Norcross, Ga., said it acquired the clinical laboratories of closely held Central Diagnostic Laboratory Inc. in a cash and securities transaction valued at $85 million. 
20/wsj_2099:Unilab, which provides clinical laboratory services, competed with Central, based in Tarzana, Calif., in a number of areas.
21/wsj_2100:Two weeks ago, viewers of several NBC daytime consumer segments started calling a 900 number for advice on various life-style issues.
21/wsj_2100:But right now programmers are figuring that viewers who are busy dialing up a range of services may put down their remote control zappers and stay tuned. 
21/wsj_2100:"We've been spending a lot of time in Los Angeles talking to TV production people," says Mike Parks, president of Call Interactive, which supplied technology for both ABC Sports and NBC's consumer minutes. "With the competitiveness of the television market these days, everyone is looking for a way to get viewers more excited." 
21/wsj_2100:One of the leaders behind the expanded use of 900 numbers is Call Interactive, a joint venture of giants American Express Co. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co. Formed in August, the venture weds AT&T's newly expanded 900 service with 200 voice-activated computers in American Express's Omaha, Neb., service center. 
21/wsj_2100:The use of 900 toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years.
21/wsj_2100:The cost of a 900 call is set by the originator -- ABC Sports, for example -- with the cheapest starting at 75 cents.
21/wsj_2100:From the fee, the local phone company and the long-distance carrier extract their costs to carry the call, passing the rest of the money to the originator, which must cover advertising and other costs. 
21/wsj_2100:Before, callers of 900 numbers would just listen and not talk, or they'd vote "yes" or "no" by calling one of two numbers. (People in the phone business call this technology "900 click.") Now, callers are led through complex menus of choices to retrieve information they want, and the hardware can process 10,000 calls in 90 seconds. 
21/wsj_2100:The newest uses of the 900-interactive technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications.
21/wsj_2100:The subject will be written into the plots of prime-time shows, and viewers will be given a 900 number to call.
21/wsj_2100:Callers will be sent educational booklets, and the call's modest cost will be an immediate method of raising money. 
21/wsj_2100:ABC Sports was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for "Monday Night Football." Kurt Sanger, ABC Sports's marketing director, says that now "tens of thousands" of fans call its 900 number each week to vote for the best punt return, quarterback sack, etc. 
21/wsj_2100:Profit from the calls goes to charity, but ABC Sports also uses the calls as a sales tool: After thanking callers for voting, Frank Gifford offers a football videotape for $19.95, and 5% of callers stay on the line to order it.
21/wsj_2100:Meanwhile, NBC Sports recently began "Scores Plus," a year-round, 24-hour 900 line providing a complex array of scores, analysis and fan news.
21/wsj_2100:If the caller stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the sponsor, coupons and a newsletter will be mailed, and the sponsor will be able to gather a list of desirable potential customers. 
21/wsj_2100:Mr. Parks of Call Interactive says TV executives are considering the use of 900 numbers for "talk shows, game shows, news and opinion surveys." Experts are predicting a big influx of new shows in 1990, when a service called "automatic number information" will become widely available.
21/wsj_2100:"Hard Copy," the new syndicated tabloid show from Paramount Pictures, will use its 900 number for additional purposes that include research, says executive producer Mark B. von S. Monsky. "For a piece on local heroes of World War II, we can ask people to leave the name and number of anyone they know who won a medal," he says. "That'll save us time and get people involved." 
21/wsj_2100:Fox Broadcasting experimented with this concept last year when viewers of "Married . . . With Children" voted on whether Al should say "I love you" to Peg on Valentine's Day. 
21/wsj_2100:Someday, viewers may also choose different depths of news coverage. "A menu by phone could let you decide, `I'm interested in just the beginning of story No. 1, and I want story No. 2 in depth," Mr. Monsky says. "You'll start to see shows where viewers program the program." 
21/wsj_2101:Last week another potential buyer, Whitehall Financial Group -- which had agreed in August to purchase most of Integrated's core companies for $310 million -- ended talks with Integrated. 
21/wsj_2101:Integrated said that it would continue to pursue "other alternatives" to sell the five core companies and that a group of senior executives plans to make a proposal to purchase three of the companies -- Integrated Resources Equity Corp., Resources Trust Co. and Integrated Resources Asset Management Corp.
21/wsj_2101:Integrated also said it expects to report a second-quarter loss wider than the earlier estimate of about $600 million.
21/wsj_2101:Meanwhile, a number of top sales producers from Integrated Resources Equity will meet this afternoon in Chicago to discuss their options.
21/wsj_2101:The unit is a loosely constructed group of about 3,900 independent brokers and financial planners who sell insurance, annuities, limited partnerships, mutual funds and other investments for Integrated and other firms. 
21/wsj_2101:Integrated has been struggling to avoid a bankruptcy-law filing since June, when it failed to make interest payments on nearly $1 billion of debt.
21/wsj_2101:Integrated senior and junior creditors are owed a total of about $1.8 billion. 
21/wsj_2102:The violent temblor, which lasted about 15 seconds and registered 6.9 on the Richter scale, also caused the collapse of a 30-foot section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and shook Candlestick Park.
21/wsj_2102:The tremor was centered near Hollister, southeast of San Francisco, and was felt as far as 200 miles away.
21/wsj_2102:Major injuries weren't reported at Candlestick Park, where the third game of baseball's World Series was canceled and fans evacuated from the stadium. 
21/wsj_2102:Bush vowed to veto a bill allowing federal financing for abortions in cases of rape and incest, saying tax dollars shouldn't be used to "compound a violent act with the taking of an unborn life." His pledge, in a letter to Democratic Sen. Byrd, came ahead of an expected Senate vote on spending legislation containing the provision. 
21/wsj_2102:Moscow, which left the group in 1983 to avoid explusion over allegations that political dissidents were being certified as insane, could be suspended if the misuse of psychiatry against dissenters is discovered during a review within a year. 
21/wsj_2102:NASA postponed the liftoff of the space shuttle Atlantis because of rain near the site of the launch pad in Cape Canaveral, Fla.
21/wsj_2102:The amendment is aimed at skirting a Supreme Court ruling that threw out the conviction of a Texas flag-burner on grounds that his freedom of speech was violated. 
21/wsj_2102:Federal researchers said lung-cancer mortality rates for people under 45 years of age have begun to decline, particularly for white males.
21/wsj_2102:The Bush administration is seeking an understanding with Congress to ease restrictions on U.S. involvement in foreign coups that might result in the death of a country's leader.
21/wsj_2102:The balloting, considered a test for the prime minister and the ruling Congress (I) Party, comes amid charges of inept leadership and government corruption.
21/wsj_2102:Gandhi's family has ruled independent India for all but five years of its 42-year history. 
21/wsj_2102:It was the first time in seven years that Moscow hasn't joined efforts, led by Moslem nations, to expel Israel from the world body, and was viewed as a sign of improving Soviet-Israeli ties.
21/wsj_2102:Israel was seated by a vote of 95-37, with 15 abstentions. 
21/wsj_2102:London has concluded that Austrian President Waldheim wasn't responsible for the execution of six British commandos in World War II, although he probably was aware of the slayings.
21/wsj_2102:The report by the Defense Ministry also rejected allegations that Britain covered up evidence of Waldheim's activities as a German army officer. 
21/wsj_2102:An anonymous caller to a local radio station said cocaine traffickers had slain the magistrate in retaliation for the extraditions of Colombians wanted on drug charges in the U.S. 
21/wsj_2102:They stopped short of resuming diplomatic ties, severed in 1979.
21/wsj_2102:The reconciliation talks in the Libyan desert town of Tobruk followed a meeting Monday in the Egyptian resort of Mersa Metruh. 
21/wsj_2103:Alpine Group Inc. revised its exchange offer for $43.7 million face amount of 13.5% senior subordinated debt due 1996 and extended the offer to Oct. 27 from Oct. 12. 
21/wsj_2103:The Hackensack, N.J., company said holders would receive for each $1,000 face amount, $750 face amount of a new issue of secured senior subordinated notes, convertible into common stock at an initial rate of $6.50 a share, and 50 common shares.
21/wsj_2103:Under the original proposal, the maker of specialty coatings and a developer of information-display technologies offered $400 of notes due 1996, 10 common shares and $175 in cash for each $1,000 face amount. 
21/wsj_2103:Completion of the exchange offer is subject to the tender of at least 80% of the debt, among other things.
21/wsj_2103:Alpine, which said it doesn't plan to further extend the offer, said it received $615,000 face amount of debt under the original offer. 
21/wsj_2104:The stock of UAL Corp. continued to be pounded amid signs that British Airways may balk at any hasty reformulation of the aborted $6.79 billion buy-out of United Airlines' parent. 
21/wsj_2104:UAL stock plummeted a further $24.875 to $198 on volume of more than 2.8 million shares in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
21/wsj_2104:The plunge followed a drop of $56.875 Monday, amid indications the takeover may take weeks to be revived. 
21/wsj_2104:The stock has fallen $87.25, or 31%, in the three trading days since announcement of the collapse of the $300-a-share takeover jolted the entire stock market into its second-worst plunge ever. "This is a total bloodbath" for takeover-stock traders, one investment banker said. 
21/wsj_2104:Los Angeles financier Marvin Davis, who put United in play with a $5.4 billion bid two months ago, last night proffered both a ray of hope and an extra element of uncertainty by saying he remains interested in acquiring UAL.
21/wsj_2104:Even as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. scrambled to line up bank financing for a revised version of the lapsed labor-management bid, British Airways, a 15% partner in the buying group, indicated it wants to start from scratch.
21/wsj_2104:A similar demand was made by a group that represents some of United's 26,000 noncontract employees.
21/wsj_2104:The blue-collar machinists, longtime rivals of the white-collar pilots, say the buyout would load the company with debt and weaken its finances. 
21/wsj_2104:And rumors of forced selling by takeover-stock traders triggered a 25-point downdraft in the Dow Jones Industrial Average around 11:15 a.m. EDT yesterday. 
21/wsj_2104:Citicorp, for example, said only that it had "expressions of interest of a transaction from both the borrowers and the banks," but didn't have an agreement. 
21/wsj_2104:The effort to revive the bid was complicated by the unwieldy nature of the three-party buying group.
21/wsj_2104:But British Air, which was to have supplied $750 million out of $965 million in equity financing, apparently wasn't involved in the second proposal and could well reject it even if banks obtain financing. 
21/wsj_2104:A group of United's noncontract employees said in a statement, "The fact that Wolf and other officers were going to line their pockets with literally millions of dollars while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion employees of United is not only deplorable but inexcusable." The machinists also asked for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible securities-law violations in the original bid for UAL by Mr. Davis, as well as in the response by UAL. Last week, just before the bank commitments were due, the union asked the U.S. Labor Department to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds. 
21/wsj_2104:In his statement, Mr. Wolf said, "We continue to believe our approach is sound, and that it is far better for all employees than the alternative of having an outsider own the company with employees paying for it just the same." 
21/wsj_2104:Mr. Wolf has eschewed merger advice from a major Wall Street securities firm, relying instead only on a takeover lawyer, Peter Atkins of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom. 
21/wsj_2104:The huge drop in UAL stock prompted one takeover stock trader, George Kellner, managing partner of Kellner, DiLeo & Co., to deny publicly rumors that his firm was going out of business.
21/wsj_2104:At a meeting Sept. 1 to consider the labor-management bid, the board also was informed by its investment adviser, First Boston Corp., of interest expressed by buy-out funds including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Forstmann Little & Co., as well as by Robert Bass, Morgan Stanley's buy-out fund, and Pan Am Corp. 
21/wsj_2104:The takeover-stock traders were hoping that Mr. Davis or one of the other interested parties might re-emerge with the situation in disarray, or that the board might consider a recapitalization. 
21/wsj_2105:Macmillan Inc. said it plans a public offering of 8.4 million shares of its Berlitz International Inc. unit at $19 to $21 a share. 
21/wsj_2105:The offering for the language school unit was announced by Robert Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer of London-based Maxwell Communication Corp., which owns Macmillan. 
21/wsj_2105:After the offering is completed, Macmillan will own about 56% of the Berlitz common stock outstanding.
21/wsj_2105:The company said it expects to pay the first dividend, of 12.5 cents a share, in the 1990 first quarter. 
21/wsj_2105:Proceeds from the borrowings under the credit agreement will be used to pay an $80 million cash dividend to Macmillan and to lend the remainder of about $128 million to Maxwell Communications in connection with a promissory note. 
21/wsj_2105:Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay borrowings under the short-term parts of a credit agreement. 
21/wsj_2105:In the past five years, more than 68% of its sales have been outside the U.S. Macmillan has owned Berlitz since 1966. 
21/wsj_2105:In the first six months of this year, Berlitz posted net income of $7.6 million on sales of $106.2 million, compared with net income of $8.2 million on sales of $90.6 million. 
21/wsj_2106:It attracts people with funny hair (or with no hair -- in front of me a girl with spiked locks sat beside a boy who had shaved his).
21/wsj_2106:Whoever constitute the local Left Bank come out in force, dressed in black, along with a smattering of yuppies who want to be on the cutting edge.
21/wsj_2106:Currently in the middle of a four-week, 20-city tour as a solo pianist, Mr. Glass has left behind his synthesizers, equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone.
21/wsj_2106:The typical Glass audience, which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers, certainly does. 
21/wsj_2106:Philip Glass is the emperor, and his music the new clothes, of the avant-garde.
21/wsj_2106:Far from being minimalist, the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of 4/4 time, octave intervals, and ragtime or gospel chord progressions.
21/wsj_2106:But the music has its charm, and Mr. Glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex. "Opening" (1981), from Glassworks, introduces the audience to the Glass technique: Never straying too far from the piano's center, Mr. Glass works in the two octaves on either side of middle C, and his fingers seldom leave the keys.
21/wsj_2106:The music is not especially pianistic; indeed, it's hard to imagine a bad performance of it.
21/wsj_2106:With "Planet News," music meant to accompany readings of Allen Ginsberg's "Wichita Vortex Sutra," Mr. Glass gets going.
21/wsj_2106:The chords modulate, but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin to wander over more of the keys.
21/wsj_2106:He does this in at least three of his solo pieces.
21/wsj_2106:In "Mad Rush," which came from a commission to write a piece of indeterminate length (Mr.
21/wsj_2106:Not only is the typical Glasswork open-ended, it is also often multiple in its context(s). "Mad Rush" began its life as the accompaniment to the Dalai Lama's first public address in the U.S., when Mr. Glass played it on the organ at New York's Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
21/wsj_2106:Later it was performed on Radio Bremen in Germany, and then Lucinda Childs took it for one of her dance pieces.
21/wsj_2106:Parts 1, 2, and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris's acclaimed film, "The Thin Blue Line," and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name.
21/wsj_2106:When used as background in this way, the music has an appropriate eeriness, as when a two-note phrase, a descending minor third, accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports, interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film.
21/wsj_2106:Admirers of Mr. Glass may agree with the critic Richard Kostelanetz's sense that the 1974 "Music in Twelve Parts" is as encyclopedic and weighty as "The Well-Tempered Clavier." But while making the obvious point that both composers develop variations from themes, this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. Glass's music.
21/wsj_2106:Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical Stravinsky, the genuinely radical minimalism of Berg and Webern, and what in retrospect even seems like concision in Mahler. 
21/wsj_2106:Mr. Spiegelman is professor of English at Southern Methodist University and editor of the Southwest Review. 
21/wsj_2107:Honeywell Inc. said it hopes to complete shortly the first of two sales of shares in its Japanese joint venture, Yamatake-Honeywell, for about $280 million. 
21/wsj_2107:The company wouldn't disclose the buyer of the initial 16% stake. 
21/wsj_2107:Proceeds of the sale, expected to be completed next week, would be used to repurchase as many as 10 million shares of Honeywell stock, the company said. 
21/wsj_2107:Honeywell said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in Yamatake-Honeywell, but indicated it intends to hold at least 20% of the joint venture's stock long term.
21/wsj_2107:Honeywell previously said it intended to reduce its holding in the Japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of dependence on weapons sales.
21/wsj_2107:Overall, Honeywell reported earnings of $74.4 million, or $1.73 a share, for the three months ended Oct. 1 compared with a loss of $41.4 million, or 98 cents a share, a year earlier.
21/wsj_2107:For the nine months, Honeywell reported earnings of $212.1 million, or $4.92 a share, compared with earnings of $47.9 million, or $1.13 a share, a year earlier.
21/wsj_2108:In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups, Michael S. Greve informs your readers, ". . . the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense, rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge" ("Congress's Environmental Buccaneers," Sept. 18). 
21/wsj_2108:The Clean Water Act contains no "legal standard" of zero discharge.
21/wsj_2108:It requires that "discharges of pollutants" into the "waters of the United States" be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301.
21/wsj_2108:Perhaps Mr. Greve was confused by Congress's meaningless statement of "the national goal" in section 101, which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by 1985, no less.
21/wsj_2108:This fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in 1972, and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute. 
21/wsj_2108:Thus, you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve suggests, even facetiously, that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water; your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them, as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters, from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors. 
21/wsj_2109:Despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the Third World, it hasn't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women.
21/wsj_2109:Advertisers don't think of the magazine first, says Joan McCraw, who joined in April as national advertising director. "What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance.
21/wsj_2109:It largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics: 10.8 million subscribers in the first half, up from 10.5 million a year ago; an average age of 42 for readers -- at the height of their consuming years; loyalty to the tune of an 85% average subscription renewal rate. 
21/wsj_2109:Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- $130,000 for a four-color page, vs. $47,000 for the Smithsonian, a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation.
21/wsj_2109:To combat that problem, National Geographic, like other magazines, began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines -- for example, ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest 25 markets. 
21/wsj_2109:But the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions, and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors.
21/wsj_2109:Another sticking point for advertisers was National Geographic's tradition of lumping its ads together, usually at the beginning or end of the magazine, rather than spreading ads out among its articles, as most magazines do.
21/wsj_2109:The centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign, into which the magazine will pour about $500,000, mostly in the next few weeks.
21/wsj_2109:The campaign, created by Omnicom Group's DDB Needham agency, takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that National Geographic is known for.
21/wsj_2109:In one ad, a photo of the interior of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris is paired with the headline, "The only book more respected than ours doesn't accept advertising." Another ad pictures a tree ant, magnified 80 times, with the headline, "For impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions." 
21/wsj_2109:Whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain. "The ad campaign is meant to contemporize the thought of National Geographic," she says. "We want it to be a '90s kind of image." 
21/wsj_2109:WCRS Group hopes to announce, perhaps today, an agreement to sell the majority of its ad unit to Paris-based Eurocom, a European ad executive said. 
21/wsj_2109:Executives of the two agencies couldn't be reached last night. 
21/wsj_2109:NEW ACCOUNT: Procter & Gamble Co., Cincinnati, awarded the ad accounts for its line of Professional Crisco vegetable shortening and oil products to Northlich, Stolley, LaWarre, Cincinnati.

21/wsj_2110:The CFTC said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites "problems" associated with the practice.
21/wsj_2110:The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
21/wsj_2110:While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges, dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations.
21/wsj_2110:Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders' customer orders. 
21/wsj_2110:Traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders. 
21/wsj_2110:The study, by the CFTC's division of economic analysis, shows that "a trade is a trade," a member of the study team said.
21/wsj_2110:Currently, most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts, which makes them brokers, or for their own accounts as socalled locals. "The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market," Mrs. Gramm told the Senate panel. 
21/wsj_2110:Members of Congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize CFTC operations.
21/wsj_2110:The House's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more, comprising those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system.
21/wsj_2110:So far, one test of restricting dual trading has worked well.
21/wsj_2110:But at a meeting last week, Tom Donovan, the Board of Trade's president, told commodity lawyers: "Dual trading is definitely worth saving.
21/wsj_2111:Specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each showroom and a tile bridge spanning a stream that flows into the building from outside. 
21/wsj_2111:But only two-thirds of Lexus dealers are constructing new buildings according to the Lexus specs.
21/wsj_2111:Lee Seidman of Cleveland says Infiniti "was a bear on interiors" but at least let him retrofit an existing building -- without the stream.
21/wsj_2111:Dictaphone Corp. was caught off guard in 1974 when its main competitor, Lanier Office Products of Japan, introduced a microcassette dictation recorder half the size of standard cassette devices.
21/wsj_2111:Blocked by patent protection from following suit, Dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again -- down to the length of a paperclip.
21/wsj_2111:By 1979, designers and engineers at Dictaphone, a Pitney Bowes subsidiary, had produced a working model of a "picocassette" recorder. 
21/wsj_2111:By 1982, however, the patent status of the Lanier microcassette had changed, permitting Dictaphone to develop its own competitive micro system, which it did.
21/wsj_2111:Marketing and sales departments then urged abandonment of the pico project.
21/wsj_2111:"It gave me great pride to see the inventor of the microcassette in Japan look at the pico and shake his head and say `unbelievable, '" says Mr. Jachmann. 
21/wsj_2111:Dictaphone's picocassette recorder is one of 13 case studies in the TRIAD Design Project, sponsored by the Design Management Institute of Boston and Harvard Business School.
21/wsj_2111:The studies are on exhibit at Harvard this month and will travel to Chicago's Institute of Design and the University of California at Berkeley. 
21/wsj_2111:ONE DAY Carl Barrett of Mobile, Ala., was raking some sycamore leaves, but the rake kept riding up over the piles.
21/wsj_2111:So Mr. Barrett, then vice president of the Alabama Steamship Association, took a steel-toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake about nine inches up.
21/wsj_2111:His crude device worked: The lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile, while the higher, harder teeth moved the top of the pile.
21/wsj_2111:One customer, Donald Blaggs of Mobile, says the Barrett Rake allowed him to do his lawn in 2 1/2 hours, two hours less than usual. 
21/wsj_2111:Richard Mason, president of Ames Co. in Parkersburg, W. Va., says the Barrett rake "makes sense," but it would be "tough" to explain to consumers. 
21/wsj_2111:John Stoner, marketing director for True Temper Corp., a subsidiary of Black & Decker, says people don't want to move a leaf pile. "They either pick it up," he says, "or they start pulling from a fresh direction."

21/wsj_2112:We keep a lot of shrines to him around the Pentagon: statues, busts, relics and such.
21/wsj_2112:The Army headquarters on the third deck of the Pentagon used to burn a lot of incense to him, but the Navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it.
21/wsj_2112:You see, Marshall had this thing about the Navy and the Marines -- he wanted to make them part of the Army but Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal blocked him.
21/wsj_2112:To keep him quiet we invent a new unified command every year or so run by the Army or the Air Force and put more of the Navy and Marines under it.
21/wsj_2112:Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all -- the ghost of the shah of Iran.
21/wsj_2112:Why, he used to lay in wait for Cap; suddenly he'd leap from behind some statue of Marshall onto Cap's chest and grab him by the throat and choke him till he coughed up an additional $2 billion or so. 
21/wsj_2112:He bought $4 billion in prepositioning ships and $7 billion in ammo and equipment to fill them, and parked them at a new $6 billion base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean.
21/wsj_2112:He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. 
21/wsj_2112:But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap, so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $7 billion of loading barges, ramps, etc., in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains. 
21/wsj_2112:But then it turned out that President Siad Barrah was not at all a nice person and the Navy pointed out that the base he promised us in Berbera had silted up about a hundred years ago and anyway was 1,244 miles from the mouth of the Gulf. (But who's counting.) Still, Berbera was the best we could get, so we stay in bed with President Barrah.
21/wsj_2112:But wouldn't you know, now that we are spending jillions of dollars, and have built those new divisions and new air wings, and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the Russians in Iran, the Russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject.
21/wsj_2112:Meanwhile, Congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget. 
21/wsj_2112:And why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by abolishing Central Command and putting responsibility for Gulf naval operations back where it belongs, afloat with the task force commander in the Gulf?
21/wsj_2112:He appeared late one night in the bedroom of the new defense secretary, Dick Cheney.
21/wsj_2112:Marshall came clanking in like Marley's ghost dragging those chains of brigades and air wings and links with Arab despots.

21/wsj_2113:The metal and marble lobby of CenTrust Bank's headquarters is grander than your average savings and loan.
21/wsj_2113:At the moment, however, the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed CenTrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive, David L. Paul.
21/wsj_2113:In an international buying spree that began barely two years ago, Mr. Paul amassed a collection of about 30 pre-18th-century works, including the Preti, at a total cost of $28 million. 
21/wsj_2113:By midnight Oct. 6, all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off, under orders from Florida's comptroller, whose office regulates the state's S&Ls.
21/wsj_2113:The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan Mr. Paul had in which the art was to do double duty -- as an investment for CenTrust and as decoration for the S&L's new office tower, designed by I.M. Pei.
21/wsj_2113:The rub is that the $28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as CenTrust was losing money hand over fist.
21/wsj_2113:Besides that, some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of CenTrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman's estate on La Gorce Isle off Miami Beach. 
21/wsj_2113:The acquisitions, officials said in a letter to Mr. Paul, were "unsafe, unsound and unauthorized." So far, Mr. Paul has unloaded but three of his masterpieces, he won't say to whom.
21/wsj_2113:"It's not like selling Chevrolets," Mr. Paul says, as he takes a drag on a goldbanded St. Moritz cigarette. "The last six months has established the quality of the collection.
21/wsj_2113:Despite Mr. Paul's characteristic hauteur, the 50-year-old, chain-smoking dynamo is finding that getting CenTrust -- Florida's largest thrift institution -- out of its riskiest investments is much tougher than getting into them had been.
21/wsj_2113:Paintings are just part of the picture.
21/wsj_2113:Divesting itself of what is left, as is required of all thrift institutions by July 1994 under the new federal S&L bailout law, may well prove difficult. 
21/wsj_2113:Mr. Paul has a plan to bring in $150 million by selling off 63 of CenTrust's 71 branches, but it has yet to be approved by regulators. 
21/wsj_2113:Embittered shareholders (some of whom are suing) say the chairman and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national S&L crisis. (CenTrust shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $15.125 in 1986 to close yesterday at $2.875.) Gallery directors, meanwhile, say Mr. Paul and others of his ilk have left an indelible mark on the art world -- and not for the better. 
21/wsj_2113:Collectors don't say "It's a van Gogh" anymore, laments Harry Brooks, the president of Wildenstein & Co., a New York gallery. "They say, `Johnny Payson got $53 million for his, so certainly $10 million isn't too much for mine. ' The great collectors we depended on, such as Paul Mellon or Norton Simon, have stopped buying, and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting. . . ." Mr. Payson, an art dealer and collector, sold Vincent van Gogh's "Irises" at a Sotheby's auction in November 1987 to Australian businessman Alan Bond. (Trouble is, Mr. Bond has yet to pay up, and until he does, Sotheby's has the painting under lock and key.) 
21/wsj_2113:He established his reputation as a freespender in January last year at Sotheby's auction of the Linda and Gerald Guterman collection in New York.
21/wsj_2113:There, on one of his first shopping trips, Mr. Paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices.
21/wsj_2113:The price paid was a record for the artist. (Some 64% of items offered at the Guterman auction were sold, at an average price of $343,333.
21/wsj_2113:The rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids.) Afterward, Mr. Paul is said by Mr. Guterman to have phoned Mr. Guterman, the New York developer selling the collection, and gloated. 
21/wsj_2113:Mr. Paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting, with the help of George Wachter, a Sotheby's expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the Guterman items.
21/wsj_2113:Nicholas Hall, the president of the Colnaghi U.S.A. Ltd. gallery in New York, sold Mr. Paul "Abraham and Sarah in the Wilderness" by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.
21/wsj_2113:Mr. Hall says Mr. Paul "was known to spend a lot of money.
21/wsj_2113:Mr. Paul was eager to assemble a collection for the headquarters CenTrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year.
21/wsj_2113:Sotheby's, the auction house founded in London 1744 and now under the umbrella of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it strove to build its U.S. business.
21/wsj_2113:Last October, Mr. Paul paid out $12 million of CenTrust's cash -- plus a $1.2 million commission -- for "Portrait of a Man as Mars." The painting, attributed to Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens, was purchased privately through Sotheby's, not at auction. 
21/wsj_2113:In March 1989, just 15 months into his campaign, Mr. Paul was named by Art & Antiques magazine as one of the top 100 individual collectors in the U.S. "An unknown quantity to most of the art world, Paul is no stranger to lavish spending," the magazine said, noting that he doesn't stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art you can eat. "He recently bid $30,000 at a Paris charity auction for a dinner cooked by six of the world's great chefs, but the final party cost closer to $100,000." (Mr.
21/wsj_2113:The art collection might have come to rival the Medicis' had the Florida comptroller's office not got wind of Mr. Paul's aesthetic adventure. 
21/wsj_2113:In its letter to him, dated March 2 and shared with reporters, Alex Hager, the chief of the thrift-institution bureau in the comptroller's office, expressed puzzlement that the S&L could be so profligate when it had reported losses of more than $13 million in its two preceding quarters. 
21/wsj_2113:The comptroller's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands, ordering that the "book value of the collection {be} reduced to zero." In other words: Get rid of all the pictures.
21/wsj_2113:Mr. Paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at Sotheby's.
21/wsj_2113:He explains that he was "merely storing the paintings at home -- with some display -- because of the special dehumidified environment" required for their safekeeping, until CenTrust's new building was ready for them.
21/wsj_2113:It came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that Mr. Paul has benefited handsomely from his association with CenTrust.
21/wsj_2113:He owns 43% of CenTrust's shares. 
21/wsj_2113:David Tunick, the president of David Tunick Inc., a New York gallery, says scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens.
21/wsj_2113:Victor Wiener, the executive director of the Appraisers Association of America, agrees that Mr. Paul paid very dearly for the Rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat. "It's not beyond credibility the Rubens will someday be worth $12 million, but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen." 
21/wsj_2113:Jonathan H. Kress, the son of the painting's former owner, Mrs. Rush Kress, dismisses the price talk as "sour grapes." Dealers contemptuous of the purchase price, he says, were themselves interested in buying the Rubens but lost out. 
21/wsj_2113:Mr. Paul, for his part, defends the Rubens price, saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself. "Most of them weren't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly," he says. 
21/wsj_2113:Art prices are skyrocketing, but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales.
21/wsj_2113:Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment-banking firm, in its annual tally of investment returns, reported that old masters appreciated 51% in the year ended June 1, the greatest return of any of 13 assets it tracked. (Impressionist and modern paintings, not tracked by Salomon, are ranked even higher at 74% by Sotheby's.) 
21/wsj_2113:Also, at any of Sotheby's auctions of old masters, roughly one-third to one-fifth of what is offered doesn't sell at any price.
21/wsj_2113:Mr. Hall of the Colnaghi gallery says $1.15 million "would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a Preti four years ago." But from his vantage point, it isn't that Mr. Paul, a customer of his too, overpaid for the work, "a gargantuan painting by an artist who is not a household word." (The painting is 10 feet wide, seven feet high.) Rather, "It just shows things have changed." 
21/wsj_2113:And while Sotheby's chief rivals in the art world, private art dealers, "won't be happy to hear it," she adds, "a number of {the artworks} have already been sold, and at a substantial profit." Mr. Paul claims to have sold three paintings, at more than a 10% profit.
21/wsj_2113:After all, he had the counsel of "curators from the most reputable museums in the world." He says he expects to sell the collection -- including the controversial Rubens -- "carefully and prudently, just as it was put together." 
21/wsj_2113:But in art-world parlance, Mr. Paul's holdings are "burnt." That is, he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon, and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works. "After a few years, you can argue there has been natural appreciation," says Susan Theran, the publisher of Leonard's Annual Price Index of Art Auctions.
21/wsj_2113:Naomi Bernhard Levinson, a fine-arts appraiser at Bernhard Associates in San Francisco, considers it "definite conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased." Sotheby's, she says, is "wearing both hats." 
21/wsj_2113:"I can't see why there would be a conflict of interest," says Sotheby's Ms. Levitt. "Estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions, and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be." Frequently, clients express interest in paintings but don't end up bidding, she adds, "so we don't know who the potential buyer will be." 
21/wsj_2113:Mr. Paul says that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as Japan and Italy have examined the collection. 
21/wsj_2113:Because of the pressure on CenTrust to sell, dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at bargain-basement prices.
21/wsj_2113:One dealer, Martin Zimet of French & Co. in New York, says he "would have loved to buy" a Jan Davids de Heem painting from the bank. "I tried to steal the picture -- to buy it attractively -- and {Sotheby's} wouldn't do it.
21/wsj_2113:Mr. Paul has been characterized as "the Great Gatsby or something," complains Karen E. Brinkman, an executive vice president of CenTrust.
21/wsj_2113:But at just that moment, he is interrupted in his office by a servant in tuxedo who pours coffee from silver into a cup of china and dabs the brim with linen. 
21/wsj_2113:The offices are done in hardwood and oriental rugs, leatherbound books and, of course, a $12 million Rubens.

21/wsj_2115:CREATIVE ACCOUNTING, mostly by conglomerates, forced CPAs to change their way of setting standards to be followed by corporations reporting financial results, standards that had become all too flexible. 
21/wsj_2115:The new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) was created in 1972 to replace the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
21/wsj_2115:All of the former board's members were CPAs, provoking conflict-of-interest criticism because they were writing rules while handling clients' books at the same time. 
21/wsj_2115:Keepers of the books, dubbed "figure filberts," loathed the threat.

21/wsj_2119:Helionetics Inc. said it agreed to team with a unit of Minneapolis-based Honeywell Inc. to provide power amplifiers for a new military sonar system being proposed by Honeywell. 
21/wsj_2119:Total value of the contract could be $100 million, Helionetics said, and work on the project would be about evenly divided. 
21/wsj_2120:This Los Angeles company and its Union Federal Savings Bank subsidiary said more than 99% of their 7 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures due 2011 were tendered for conversion into UnionFed common stock.

21/wsj_2123:The No. 1 domestic aluminum producer, Aluminum Co. of America, Friday said its earnings fell 3.2% to $219 million, or $2.46 a share.
21/wsj_2123:"It's a good indication that level of profitability has peaked for the industry," says Vahid Fathi, metals analyst with Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc., who had estimated Reynolds would earn about $2.35 a share. 
21/wsj_2123:The nation's No. 2 aluminum company said earnings were hurt by lower prices for certain fabricated aluminum products, which typically follow price fluctuations of primary ingots.
21/wsj_2123:Much of the price decline has been blamed on a slowing economy and the third quarter is typically the industry's slowest period. 
21/wsj_2123:Aluminum shipments of 329,600 metric tons were nearly equal to the year-earlier period, the company said. 
21/wsj_2124:"The stock market ain't going to do much of anything" for a while, says John Neff of Wellington Management, who runs the $8.3 billion Windsor Fund.
21/wsj_2124:Mr. Neff says the stock market has lost some powerful driving forces, namely earnings growth and the "LBO sweepstakes" -- buy-out fever that induced investors to bid up whole groups of stocks, such as media and airlines.
21/wsj_2124:After sitting with 20% of his fund in cash before Friday's sell-off, Mr. Neff says he bought "a narrow list of stocks" yesterday. 
21/wsj_2124:"This is not a grossly overvalued market, but it's not cheap either," says George Collins, president of the mutual fund company T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. 
21/wsj_2124:After Friday's decline, Mr. Perritt's firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks, using old-fashioned value criteria devised by Benjamin Graham, an analyst and author in the 1930s and 1940s who is widely considered to be the father of modern securities analysis.
21/wsj_2124:"Generalizations about value aren't useful," says New York money manager John LeFrere of Delta Capital Management.
21/wsj_2124:Money manager Robert Ross, head of Duncan Ross Associates Ltd. in Vancouver, British Columbia, says stocks would have to fall 15% to 20% before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives.
21/wsj_2124:Fredric Russell, a money manager in Tulsa, Okla., says Friday's cave-in "is going to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many investors than Wall Street would want to admit." 
21/wsj_2124:There are still bulls out there. "I still think we will have a 3000 Dow, whether it's six months or 12 months from now I don't know," says David Dreman, managing partner of Dreman Value Management in New York. "We're doing a little buying" in some stocks "that have really been smashed down." 
21/wsj_2124:Yesterday, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter all increased the proportion of assets they recommend investors commit to stocks.
21/wsj_2124:Some investors say Friday's sell-off was a good thing, because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation. "It was a healthy cleansing," says Michael Holland, who runs Salomon Brothers Asset Management in New York. 
21/wsj_2124:Friday's big fall was "just a blunder by the stock market," says John Connolly, chief strategist for Dean Witter. "It was an overreaction to an event {the failure of a management and union group to get bank financing for a takeover of UAL} that doesn't mean that much to lots of stocks." Many investors have nagging worries, however.
21/wsj_2124:Newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans.
21/wsj_2125:The turmoil on Wall Street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains, investment bankers and retailers said. 
21/wsj_2125:The combination of so many chains available for sale, the recent failures of such retailing LBO's as Miller & Rhoads Inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices, retailing observers said. 
21/wsj_2125:"The pricing will become more realistic, which should help management," said Bruce Rosenthal, a New York investment banker with Nathan S. Jonas & Co. "Investors aren't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed LBOs, but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense, either." 
21/wsj_2125:In addition, the fall selling season has generally been a good one, especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues. 
21/wsj_2125:"What's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings, not liquidation values," said Joseph E. Brooks, chairman and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor Inc., a specialty chain. "Retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies." 
21/wsj_2125:Still, most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing LBOs will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds, a market already in tumult, in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the Federated and Allied units of Campeau. 
21/wsj_2125:"Prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week, which will help management," said Gilbert Harrison, chairman of Financo Inc., an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions. "But the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved.
21/wsj_2125:Potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management, or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past." 
21/wsj_2126:Sony Corp. won a pretrial order blocking U.S. sales of Justin Products Inc. 's "My Own" line of portable audio players for children. 
21/wsj_2126:Judge John E. Sprizzo issued the order in Manhattan federal court, where Sony has accused the tiny company of illegally knocking off the "My First Sony" line.
21/wsj_2126:The judge held that the combination of colors used for the Sony products is distinctive and subject to protection under New York state law, rather than federal law.
21/wsj_2126:The legal fight was the subject of a Wall Street Journal story yesterday. 
21/wsj_2126:He also repeated Justin's denial of Sony's charges. 
21/wsj_2126:"Their likelihood of reversing us is very slim," said Lewis H. Eslinger, Sony's attorney, who said he doubts Justin will go ahead with a trial. 
21/wsj_2127:CONTINENTAL MORTGAGE & EQUITY TRUST said it will resume dividend payments with a 10-cent-a-share payout on Nov. 6 to shares of record Oct. 25.
21/wsj_2127:Despite continuing troubles with problem assets and nonperforming loans, the trust said it expects to be able to maintain or increase the rate of distributions because of operations of joint-venture properties. 
21/wsj_2128:A federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of $1 billion in costs from controversial "take-or-pay" contracts. 
21/wsj_2128:FERC's regulation had given pipelines until March 31, 1989, to pass on to customers as much as 50% of the costs of buying out their broken contracts, which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short. 
21/wsj_2128:A majority of old contracts were renegotiated by the deadline and settled at steep discounts.
21/wsj_2128:According to industry lawyers, the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism.
21/wsj_2128:The court, agreeing with pipeline companies, found the March 31 deadline was "arbitrary and capricious" and "highly prejudicial to the bargaining power of pipelines" that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old take-or-pay contracts to meet the deadline. 
21/wsj_2128:A report last month by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America found that pipelines' settlement costs had jumped in the three months before the deadline to 39 cents on the dollar, from 22 cents on the dollar in 1988. 
21/wsj_2128:The court ordered FERC to justify within 60 days not only its cost-sharing deadline, but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation.
21/wsj_2128:The court's decision would allow FERC to change some of its provisions, but ensures it will be reviewed again quickly by the court. 
21/wsj_2130:NATIONAL INCOME REALTY TRUST said it will resume dividend payments with a 12-cent-a-share dividend to be paid Nov. 6 to shares of record Oct. 25.
21/wsj_2131:MLX Corp. said it reached a preliminary agreement with senior lenders to its refrigeration and air-conditioning group to restructure the $188.5 million of credit facilities the lenders provide to the group. 
21/wsj_2131:MLX, which also makes aircraft and heavy-duty truck parts, said the debt was accumulated during its acquisition of nine businesses that make up the group, the biggest portion of which was related to the 1986 purchase of a Hillman Co. unit. 
21/wsj_2131:Among other things, the restructured facilities will substantially reduce the group's required amortization of the term loan portion of the credit facilities through September 1992, MLX said.
21/wsj_2131:Certain details of the restructured facilities remain to be negotiated.
21/wsj_2131:The agreement is subject to completion of a definitive amendment and appropriate approvals. 
21/wsj_2131:William P. Panny, MLX chairman and chief executive, said the pact "will provide MLX with the additional time and flexibility necessary to complete the restructuring of the company's capital structure." 
21/wsj_2131:MLX has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering a proposed offering of $120 million in long-term senior subordinated notes and warrants. 
21/wsj_2132:Dow Jones & Co. said it acquired a 15% interest in DataTimes Corp., a subsidiary of Oklahoma Publishing Co., Oklahoma City, that provides electronic research services.
21/wsj_2132:Customers of either DataTimes or Dow Jones News/Retrieval are able to access the information on both services.
21/wsj_2132:Dow Jones is the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. 
21/wsj_2133:Flowers Industries Inc. said it will report a charge of eight cents to 10 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 23, from the sale of two bakeries, in High Point, N.C., and Gadsden, Ala. 
21/wsj_2133:It said the sales were part of a 1983 Federal Trade Commission Consent Order. 
21/wsj_2133:A year earlier, Flowers had fiscal first-quarter net income of $8 million, or 23 cents a share, on revenue of $170.4 million. 
21/wsj_2134:The industry used 82.2% of its capability last week, compared with 82.8% the previous week and 84% a year ago. 
21/wsj_2134:The capability utilization rate is a calculation designed to indicate at what percent of its production capability the industry is operating in a given week. 
21/wsj_2135:Selwyn B. Kossuth was named executive director of the commission, effective early November.
21/wsj_2135:Mr. Kossuth was vice president and director, corporate finance, of Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., a Toronto investment dealer. 
21/wsj_2136:Market Data Retrieval is a compiler of educational information and provides related services.
21/wsj_2136:Closely held Intelligence in Education, of Larchmont, N.Y., is an educational publisher and consultant. 
21/wsj_2136:Expo enthusiasts argue that holding the fair would attract businesses, create jobs and help renovate abandoned sections of town.
21/wsj_2136:But opponents fear overcrowding. "This city already has too many tourists, and it can't hold them all," says Pierluigi Beggiato, the president of the Venice hoteliers association. 
21/wsj_2136:Algeria plans to increase natural-gas sales to Europe and the U.S. According to the Middle East Economic Survey, the North African nation is holding talks with Italy for adding a fourth pipe to a section of the Trans-Mediterranean pipeline, expanding capacity by up to six billion cubic meters a year from 12.5 billion.
21/wsj_2136:Algeria also wants to build a pipeline through Morocco and across the Strait of Gibraltar to supply Spain, France and West Germany with up to 15 billion cubic meters a year by the late 1990s. 
21/wsj_2136:South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers agreed to suspend the strike by diamond workers and resume negotiations with De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. over their wage dispute, De Beers said.
21/wsj_2136:The strike at five De Beers mines began last Thursday, with 9,500 out of a total 10,000 NUM members employed on De Beers mines participating, according to the union, while De Beers said there were 7,800 participants.
21/wsj_2136:The union has demanded a 37.6% increase in the minimum wage while De Beers's final offer was an increase of 17%. 
21/wsj_2136:The gathering is expected to focus on curbing the fouling of rivers and lakes, limiting damage from industrial accidents and improving the handling of harmful chemicals.
21/wsj_2136:West German Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer said Bonn is convinced of the need for cooperation, "especially with our neighbors in the East, because we are directly affected by their ecological progress or lack of it." The U.S. and Canada joined every European country except Albania at the meeting. 
21/wsj_2136:The Swedish publishers of a new Estonian-language newspaper rushed an extra edition across the Baltic on Oct. 10 after the first run sold out in one day.
21/wsj_2136:Editor Hasse Olsson said plans had called for 7,000 copies of the monthly Are Paev (Business Paper) to be sold at newsstands and an additional 3,000 promotion issues to be sent by direct mail.
21/wsj_2136:He said 13,000 more copies were sent to Estonia because of strong sales.
21/wsj_2136:The Swedish publishing company Bonniers owns 51% of Are Paev, and the Estonian management company Minor owns 49%. 
21/wsj_2136:Mr. Gurria's optimism contrasts with some bankers' views that the deal may require a lot of arm twisting by the U.S. Treasury in order to succeed.
21/wsj_2136:Mr. Gurria, Mexico's under-secretary of the ministry of finance, met yesterday with European bankers in London, at the half-way point on a so-called road show to market the package around the world. 
21/wsj_2136:An increasing number of banks appear to be considering the option under the deal whereby they can swap their Mexican loans for 30-year bonds with a face value discounted by 35%, Mr. Gurria said.
21/wsj_2136:The other two options consist of swapping loans for bonds with 6.25% interest rates, or providing fresh loans. 
21/wsj_2136:The accord, which covers $52.7 billion of Mexico's medium- and long-term debt, is expected to go into effect in early 
21/wsj_2136:The amount is equal to about 30 years earnings for the average peasant, who makes $145 a year. . . . China will spend $9.45 million for urgent maintenance on Tibet's Potala Palace, former home of the Dalai Lama, the China News Service said.
21/wsj_2137:George W. Koch, 63 years old, president and chief executive officer of Grocery Manufacturers of America Inc., was elected a director of this maker of spices, seasonings and specialty foods, succeeding Erskin N. White Jr., 65, who resigned. 
21/wsj_2139:In yesterday's edition, it was incorrectly included with a list of New York chains up for sale. 
21/wsj_2140:"We are very lucky to easily change an export loss to domestic plus," says Hong Tu Pyo, managing director of domestic marketing for Hyundai Motor Co. 
21/wsj_2140:As it is, waiting lists of a month aren't unusual for popular models.
21/wsj_2140:Demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers -- Hyundai, Kia Motors Corp., Daewoo Motor Co. and even upstart SsangYong Motor Co. -- plan to build more factories.
21/wsj_2140:Industry analysts predict that by 1995, South Korea will be building three million cars a year -- about half of that for export. 
21/wsj_2140:At that point domestic sales will slow down," says Kim Yoon Kwon, director of marketing for Daewoo Motor. 
21/wsj_2140:Pay raises of 60% over the past three years have given many South Koreans the money to enjoy the things they were supplying the rest of the world.
21/wsj_2140:The success of newcomer SsangYong Motor shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity.
21/wsj_2140:A part of the construction-oriented conglomerate SsangYong Group, it took over the dying Dong-A Motor Co. in 1986.
21/wsj_2140:SsangYong began making variations of the Jeep-like "Korando" vehicle. (Dong-A had had a technology agreement with Jeep maker American Motors Corp., now a part of Chrysler Corp.) The most popular style is the stretched "Family," which resembles a Ford Bronco or Chevy Blazer.
21/wsj_2140:SsangYong, which has only about 3% of the domestic market, will sell about 18,000 of its models this year, twice as many as last year.
21/wsj_2140:Along with two larger models, the company claims 18% of the domestic market.
21/wsj_2140:Kia is the most aggressive of the Korean Big Three in offering financing.
21/wsj_2140:Shipments of its Lemans to GM's Pontiac division are off about 65% from a year ago, versus a 44% decline for Hyundai and an 18% increase for Kia.
21/wsj_2140:Moreover, Daewoo's domestic sales have grown half as fast as sales of its rivals. 
21/wsj_2140:The big problem for Daewoo, which holds about 21% of the market, is the long series of labor disruptions it suffered this year.
21/wsj_2141:Robert P. Bulseco, 44 years old, was named president and chief administrative officer of this regional commercial bank.
21/wsj_2141:Robert Robie, 51, was named to the new positions of vice chairman and chief credit officer. 
21/wsj_2142:As the stock market bounced back, withdrawals of money from stock funds amounted to a mere trickle compared with Black Monday, when investors dumped $2.3 billion, or about 2% of stock-fund assets. 
21/wsj_2142:Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund company, said phone volume was more than double its typical level, but still half that of Oct. 19, 1987.
21/wsj_2142:Net outflows from Fidelity's stock funds stood at less than $300 million, or below 15% of the $2 billion cash position of the firm's stock portfolios.
21/wsj_2142:Much of the money was switched into the firm's money market funds.
21/wsj_2142:Outflows since the close of trading Friday remain below one-third their level of two years ago, Fidelity said. 
21/wsj_2142:"Two years ago, there was a lot of redemption activity and trouble with people getting through on the phone," said Kathryn McGrath, head of the investment management division of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
21/wsj_2142:Of course, the relative calm could be jolted if the market plunges again.
21/wsj_2142:As a group, their cash position of 10.2% of assets in August -- the latest figure available -- is 14% higher than two years earlier.
21/wsj_2142:The biggest flurry of investor activity came early in the day.
21/wsj_2142:Vanguard Group Inc. saw heavy exchanges from stock funds into money market funds after the telephone lines opened at 8:30 a.m. "In the first hour, the real nervous folks came along," a spokesman said. "But the horrendous pace of call volume in the first half-hour slowed considerably." 
21/wsj_2142:Most of that increase came in the first hour after the phone lines opened at 8 a.m. 
21/wsj_2142:Many funds allow investors to void orders before the close of trading. 
21/wsj_2142:At Fidelity's office in downtown Boston, Gerald Sherman walked in shortly after 7:30 a.m. and placed an order to switch his retirement accounts out of three stock funds and into a money market fund.
21/wsj_2142:"It's a nice feeling to know that things stabilized," said Mr. Sherman, the 51-year-old co-owner of a discount department store. 
21/wsj_2142:But some investors continued to switch out of high-risk, high-yield junk funds despite yesterday's rebound from that market's recent price declines. 
21/wsj_2142:Shareholders have been steadily bailing out of several big junk funds the past several weeks as the $200 billion market was jolted by a cash crunch at Campeau Corp. and steadily declining prices.
21/wsj_2142:Much of the money has been switched into money market funds, fund executives say. 
21/wsj_2142:Instead of selling bonds to meet redemptions, however, some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests.
21/wsj_2142:The $1.1 billion T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund was among the funds that borrowed during the Campeau crisis, says George J. Collins, president of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. 
21/wsj_2143:Amcore Financial Inc. said it agreed to acquire Central of Illinois Inc. in a stock swap. 
21/wsj_2143:Shareholders of Central, a bank holding company based in Sterling, Ill., will receive Amcore stock equal to 10 times Central's 1989 earnings, Amcore said.
21/wsj_2143:For the first nine months of 1989, Central earned $2 million. 
21/wsj_2143:Amcore, also a bank holding company, has assets of $1.06 billion.
21/wsj_2144:(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 
21/wsj_2144:Bausch & Lomb sold the softies under a sublicense from National Patent Development, which had gained the rights from the Czechoslovakia Academy of Sciences.
21/wsj_2144:But the new lens became the eye of a storm.
21/wsj_2144:In September 1971 California officials seized "bootlegged" lenses -- made by unlicensed companies -- after some showed traces of bacteria.
21/wsj_2144:Today 20 million of the 25 million Americans using contact lenses are using the soft type.
21/wsj_2145:In the wake of Friday's plunge and yesterday's rebound, some companies are already postponing deals, and others wish they could.
21/wsj_2145:"The implication of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically," says Henry Linsert Jr., chairman of Martek Corp., a four-year-old biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock. "The more variables that indicate risk, the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain." 
21/wsj_2145:Earlier this month, Staples Inc., a Newton, Mass., office-supplies discounter, said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public.
21/wsj_2145:At the time, its shares were selling above their initial offering price of $19, and bankers believed Staples would sell new stock without a hitch. 
21/wsj_2145:Unless the market goes right back up, he says, "it may take us six to nine months to find the money, instead of three." And the Columbia, Md., company may have to settle for a lower price, he adds. 
21/wsj_2145:Officers of the company, a health-care concern, "were very discouraged on Friday and felt they shouldn't go public; we felt they should," says Sanford Robertson, partner in the banking concern. 
21/wsj_2145:As the market dropped Friday, Robertson Stephens slashed the value of the offering by 7%.
21/wsj_2145:As of late yesterday, the IPO was still on. 
21/wsj_2145:For many, the situation is especially discouraging because the market for IPOs was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness. "We were just beginning to look at the increase in IPOs, seeing the light at the end of the tunnel," says Frank Kline Jr., partner in Lambda Funds, a Beverly Hills, Calif., venture capital concern. "But the tunnel's just gotten longer." 
21/wsj_2145:Exabyte Corp. had been planning to sell 10% of its stock this week in an IPO that would raise up to $28.5 million.
21/wsj_2145:Delayed financings also would affect the operations of many companies.
21/wsj_2145:Sierra Tucson Cos., a Tucson, Ariz., operator of addiction-treatment centers, has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an IPO scheduled for next week.
21/wsj_2145:In a sagging market, the Federal Reserve System "might flood the market with funds, and that should bring interest rates down," says Leonard T. Anctil, vice president of the Bank of New England, Boston. 
21/wsj_2145:James G. Zafris, president of Danvers Savings Bank, Danvers, Mass., says the market turmoil "is an absolute non-event for small business." For small companies, he says, interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges.
21/wsj_2145:Alan Wells, president of Bollinger, Wells, Lett & Co., a New York merger specialist, thinks panicky investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals.
21/wsj_2145:And William E. Wetzel Jr., a University of New Hampshire management professor and director of Venture Capital Network Inc., says the market's gyrations will underline the investors' lack of control in big stock investments.
21/wsj_2145:This will add to the appeal of small business, he says, where investors often have a degree of influence. 
21/wsj_2146:Bay said a "substantial part" of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability to sell certain properties quickly and lower-than-expected prices for sales made.
21/wsj_2146:The company said its real estate portfolio is "highly leveraged," while about two-thirds of its investments aren't income-producing.
21/wsj_2146:According to its latest annual report, about a quarter of the company's holdings are in Massachusetts, in the midst of a real-estate slump. 
21/wsj_2146:The company said it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended June 30 of $36.2 million, or $9.33 a share, on revenue of $13.1 million.
21/wsj_2146:A year earlier, the company had a loss of $10.8 million, or $3.04 a share, on revenue of $10.8 million.
21/wsj_2146:For the year, it had a net loss of $62 million, or $15.97 a share, on revenue of $44.3 million.
21/wsj_2146:In the previous year, it had a loss of $22.5 million, or $6.52 a share, on revenue of $41.1 million. 
21/wsj_2146:Although it is having serious cash-flow problems, Bay said the fair-market value of its holdings, minus debt, was equal to $6.02 a share at June 30 based on a recent appraisal.
21/wsj_2148:Results for the 1988 quarter included a gain of $1.05 a share from sale of the Reda Pump and Oilwell Cable units, partly offset by a charge of 69 cents a share for recall of faulty truck steering systems.
21/wsj_2148:The latest quarter included a gain of 11 cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge, because the reserve established last year exceeded the actual recall costs. 
21/wsj_2148:The company said aerospace and defense sales were up 2% for the quarter to $802 million, and operating profit climbed 6% to $61 million, mainly because of improved program performance in spacecraft and advanced-technology contracts. 
21/wsj_2148:Automotive sales jumped 16% to $791 million, mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems, TRW said.
21/wsj_2148:The group had an operating profit of $65 million, against a loss of $13 million a year earlier.
21/wsj_2148:However, excluding the year-earlier charge for recall of steering gear, operating profit in the latest quarter declined 14%, reflecting higher start-up and product development expenses in passenger-restraint systems.
21/wsj_2149:a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic, not unheroic, though sadly self-deceived English butler in his sixties -- proceeds as if the realistic English novel of manners, like Britannia herself, still ruled the waves.
21/wsj_2149:In fact, Kazuo Ishiguro's "The Remains of the Day" (Knopf, 245 pages, $18.95) is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them.
21/wsj_2149:It implies that the British Empire was rooted in its subjects' minds, manners and morals, and argues, tacitly, that its self-destructive flaws were embodied in the defensive snobbery, willful blindness, role-playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants. 
21/wsj_2149:As the narrator Stevens, the solitary butler of Darlington Hall, mulls over such hallowed terms as "greatness," "dignity," "service" and "loyalty," we see how pious cant subverts the soul.
21/wsj_2149:Stevens's dutiful conflation of the public and private realms -- like his beloved master's -- destroys all it was designed to preserve.
21/wsj_2149:It's 1956, the year the Suez crisis marked the final end of Empire.
21/wsj_2149:As he stands on a hill at the beginning of a six-day motor expedition from Oxfordshire to Cornwall, where a former housekeeper resides, perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage, perhaps (he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge) not disinclined to return to domestic service, Stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a self-portrait, a credo and the author's metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel we're reading: 
21/wsj_2149:"We call this land of ours Great Britain, and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice.
21/wsj_2149:Yet I would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective. . . . It is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that sets the beauty of our land apart.
21/wsj_2149:What is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty, its sense of restraint.
21/wsj_2149:It is as though the land knows of its own beauty, of its own greatness, and feels no need to shout it.
21/wsj_2149:In comparison, the sorts of sights offered in such places as Africa and America, though undoubtedly very exciting, would, I am sure, strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness." 
21/wsj_2149:But let Stevens continue in his unwitting comic manner (his conscious efforts at "banter" always fail -- most comically): "This whole question is very akin to the question that has caused much debate in our profession over the years: what is a `great' butler?" His answer is one "possessed of a dignity in keeping with his position." Such dignity "has to do crucially with a butler's ability not to abandon the professional being he inhabits." He "will not be shaken out by external events, however surprising, alarming or vexing. . . . Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of." 
21/wsj_2149:Despite his racial advantage, to be a great butler is a heroic calling; one's pantry is "not unlike general's headquarters during a battle." If, for example, in the midst of a great social occasion (such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923), one's 72-yearold father, himself a great butler once, should happen to die of a stroke, one must continue to serve the port: "Please don't think me unduly improper in not ascending to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment.
21/wsj_2149:You see, I know my father would have wished me to carry on just now." It is this kind of dignity and restraint that allows Stevens to declare: "For all its sad associations, whenever I recall that evening today, I find I do so with a large sense of triumph." We note the imperial public word used to deny private rage and sorrow.
21/wsj_2149:Mr. Ishiguro's ability to create a fallible narrative voice that permits him to explore such intertwining domestic, cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel, "An Artist of the Floating World," set in Japan after the war.
21/wsj_2149:Now shifting his scene from the country he left at five to the England he has lived in for nearly 30 years, he has fashioned a novel in the mode of Henry James and E.M. Forster.
21/wsj_2149:With great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and (utterly repressed) sexual love, but British anti-Semitism, the gentry's impatience with democracy and support of Hitler, and the moral problematics of loyalty: "It is, in practice, simply not possible to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service. . . . `This employer embodies all that I find noble and admirable.
21/wsj_2149:In the end, after meeting with the former housekeeper, Stevens sits by the seashore at dusk, thinking of her and of his employer, and declares "I trusted.
21/wsj_2149:We understand such rueful wisdom must be retrospective: The owl of Minerva only spreads her wings at dusk.
21/wsj_2149:But as "The Remains of the Day" so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity, such wisdom can be movingly embodied in art. 
21/wsj_2150:UGI Corp. said its AmeriGas subsidiary completed the previously announced sale of its air separation plant and related assets in Waukesha, Wis., to AGA Gas Inc., Cleveland.
21/wsj_2150:The transaction is part of UGI's continuing program to shed AmeriGas's industrial gas interests and expand the subsidiary's propane business.
21/wsj_2151:Stanislav Ovcharenko, who represents the Soviet airline Aeroflot here, has some visions that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika. 
21/wsj_2151:In his office overlooking the runway of Shannon Airport, Mr. Ovcharenko enthusiastically throws out what he calls "just ideas": 
21/wsj_2151:First, he suggests, GPA Group Ltd., the international aircraft leasing company based in Ireland, could lease some of its Boeing jetliners to the Soviet airline.
21/wsj_2151:Aeroflot could lease some of its cargo planes to Aer Lingus, through GPA, for a joint-venture cargo airline.
21/wsj_2151:And then there is his notion of an Irish-Soviet charter airline to ferry Armenians to Los Angeles via Shannon. 
21/wsj_2151:Have the freedoms of glasnost gone to Mr. Ovcharenko's head? 
21/wsj_2151:The airport's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the Soviet Union.
21/wsj_2151:Tankers from the Latvian port of Ventspils each year unload 25 million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport.
21/wsj_2151:Aer Rianta now manages duty-free sales on all Aeroflot international flights out of Moscow.
21/wsj_2151:Aer Rianta is talking about similar joint ventures in Tashkent and in Sochi, a Black Sea resort, and even has a computer-assembly project cooking with the Georgian city of Tbilisi. 
21/wsj_2151:Aeroflot's international fleet of 285 planes is being repainted and refurbished at Shannon Airport.
21/wsj_2151:Thanks to a new air-traffic agreement and the ability of Irish travel agents to issue Aeroflot tickets, tourists here are taking advantage of Aeroflot's reasonable prices to board flights in Shannon for holidays in Havana, Kingston and Mexico City.
21/wsj_2151:A formal blessing of sorts was bestowed on this friendship in April when Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev stopped here for talks with Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey.
21/wsj_2151:As a result, Ireland didn't spurn the Soviets after they shot down a Korean Air Lines jetliner over the Sea of Japan in 1983, though it suspended direct Moscow-Shannon flights for two months.
21/wsj_2151:In fact, Aer Lingus started ferrying Russians from Shannon to New York when Washington stripped Aeroflot of its U.S. landing rights. 
21/wsj_2151:Today, Aer Rianta is making a heap of money from its Soviet friendship.
21/wsj_2153:When Nucor Corp. begins shipping steel from the world's first thin-slab plant this month, it will begin testing the competitive mettle of its giant competitors. 
21/wsj_2153:The new technology, which creates a very thin piece of steel, radically reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets.
21/wsj_2153:An ebullient Kenneth Iverson, Nucor's chairman, says the company's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in 1.5 man hours, compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill. 
21/wsj_2153:Says the chief executive officer of a major Midwest steel company: "It's damn worrisome." 
21/wsj_2153:New, efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller, less cash-rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid decades ago.
21/wsj_2153:Eager engineers espouse direct-steelmaking and direct casting, which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces.
21/wsj_2153:"There's a revolution ahead of us that will ultimately change the way we market and distribute steel," says William Dennis, vice president, manufacturing and technology, for the American Iron Ore and Steel Institute. 
21/wsj_2153:In fact, they've spent billions of dollars to boost the percentage of continously cast steel to 60.9% in 1988, from 39.6% five years before.
21/wsj_2153:No one expects minimills to eclipse major integrated steelmakers, who remain the undisputed kings of highest-quality steel used for autos and refrigerators.
21/wsj_2153:Still, flat-rolled is the steel industry's bread and butter, representing about half of the 80 million tons of steel expected to be shipped this year. 
21/wsj_2153:Cementing such relationships with major clients -- car and appliance makers -- is a means of survival, especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers. 
21/wsj_2153:After letting aluminum-makers take the recycling lead, a group of the nation's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation. 
21/wsj_2153:Producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher-profit output, such as coated and electrogalvanized products, which remain beyond the reach of minimills.
21/wsj_2153:But unfortunately, that segment is much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled steel. "It's like everyone climbing out of the QE II and getting into a lifeboat," says John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants. "After a while, someone has to go over the side." Although he doesn't expect any bankruptcies, he does see more plants being sold or closed. 
21/wsj_2153:Robert Crandall, with the Brookings Institute, agrees. "Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar, it's unlikely that consumption of U.S. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills." 
21/wsj_2153:Not to mention the incursion of imports.
21/wsj_2153:Japanese and European steelmakers, which have led the recent technology developments, are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in 1992.
21/wsj_2153:"People think of the steel business as an old and mundane smokestack business," says Mr. Iverson. "They're dead wrong." 
21/wsj_2154:Polaroid Corp. 's patent-infringement damages case against Eastman Kodak Co., one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever, is getting scant attention on Wall Street. 
21/wsj_2154:After 78 days of mind-numbing testimony in federal court in Boston, the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys.
21/wsj_2154:Few analysts think it is worth their time to slog through the Polaroid trial testimony. "It's like panning for gold outside of Grand Central Station.
21/wsj_2154:And Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said: "If you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a (prediction) of the eventual award, I would be willing to bet that he would be off" by a lot. 
21/wsj_2154:A 75-day trial in the early 1980s determined that Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., infringed on patents of Polaroid, of Cambridge, Mass.
21/wsj_2154:Two analysts who have read the transcripts, David Nelson of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Calvert D. Crary, a litigation analyst at Labe, Simpson & Co., think Judge A. David Mazzone will decide in Kodak's favor on the "willful and deliberate" issue. 
21/wsj_2154:Mr. Crary said testimony by Kodak's patent counsel, Francis T. Carr of Kenyon & Kenyon, showed that "he worked with Kodak continuously from the outset of the project" in an effort to avoid infringement. "Carr told Kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of Polaroid's patent positions," and Kodak followed his advice in every instance, Mr. Crary said. 
21/wsj_2154:But Irving Kayton, a patent expert at George Mason University School of Law who is familiar with the case, said the fact that seven patents were infringed "suggests that infringement was willful.
21/wsj_2154:Observers also wonder whether Judge Mazzone will use the lost-profits method of determining damages, which Polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award, or the reasonable royalty method.
21/wsj_2155:The main reason was a delay in shipment of new high-end disk drives, a business that accounts for some 10% of IBM's $60 billion of annual revenue. 
21/wsj_2155:In addition, IBM noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars. 
21/wsj_2155:Earnings fell to $877 million, or $1.51 a share, somewhat below securities analysts' revised expectations of around $1.60 a share.
21/wsj_2155:That compared with the year-earlier $1.25 billion, or $2.10 a share -- which was inflated by a 15-cents-a-share gain from the sale of some MCI Communications Corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by Fujitsu Ltd. relating to a software dispute.
21/wsj_2155:We do not see anything in the fundamentals of our business that would cause us to change our strategy of investing for profitable growth." 
21/wsj_2155:Securities analysts, however, remained downbeat. "I think 1990 will be another mediocre year," said Steve Milunovich of First Boston. 
21/wsj_2155:Jay Stevens of Dean Witter actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $9 from $9.50 for 1989 and to $9.50 from $10.35 in 1990 because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected.
21/wsj_2155:Both estimates would mark declines from the 1988 net of $5.81 billion, or $9.80 a share, which itself was well below the record IBM set in 1984. 
21/wsj_2155:Mr. Stevens said he kept a "buy/hold" recommendation on the stock only because "all the damage has been done." He said the stock hasn't traded below 1 1/2 times book value over the past 10 years, which at the moment computes to a stock price of $100.
21/wsj_2155:"A key part of the question is, how soon does this disk-drive come and how soon does production ramp up?" said Steve Cohen at SoundView Financial Group. "And the input I've had from customers is that it still could be a while." 
21/wsj_2155:Bob Bardagy, executive vice president of marketing at Comdisco Inc., a huge leasing firm, said: "To put it mildly, IBM Credit has been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing company we have ever seen." 
21/wsj_2155:IBM is expected to get a boost soon when it announces some new versions of its mainframes.
21/wsj_2155:But the basic technology in the line is almost five years old, which means it is long in the tooth, and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own. 
21/wsj_2155:But it's hard to squeeze much profit out of the personal-computer business these days, and the workstation market, while important, is too small to rely on for much growth. 
21/wsj_2156:D. Wayne Calloway, also chief executive officer of the company, indicated that he expects analysts to raise their forecasts for 1989 after the company releases its earnings today.
21/wsj_2156:Results for 1989 will include about 40 cents a share from the dilutive effects of snack-food and bottling company acquisitions. 
21/wsj_2156:The company said third-quarter sales are expected to increase 25% from $3.12 billion of last year's third quarter. 
21/wsj_2156:Domestic soft-drink bottler case sales are estimated to have risen only 1% in the third quarter -- well below the 4% to 5% growth of recent years -- but about in line with the rest of the soft-drink industry. 
21/wsj_2156:Mr. Calloway blamed the slower volume on rainier weather, a dearth of new products in the industry and -- to a much lesser extent -- pricing.
21/wsj_2156:Taco Bell has turned around declining customer counts by permanently lowering the price of its tacos.
21/wsj_2156:Same store-sales for Kentucky Fried Chicken, which has struggled with increased competition in the fast-food chicken market and a lack of new products, rose only 1%. 
21/wsj_2156:The operation, which has been slow to respond to consumers' shifting tastes away from fried foods, has been developing a grilled-chicken product that may be introduced nationally at the end of next year.
21/wsj_2156:But, "You never can tell," he added, "you have to take advantage of opportunities." 
21/wsj_2157:President Bush chose Martin Allday, a longtime friend from Texas, to be chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
21/wsj_2157:The White House said Ms. Hesse, a Chicago businesswoman who previously held posts at the Energy Department and FERC, is leaving to become a vice president of First Chicago Corp. 
21/wsj_2157:The FERC is a five-member commission that regulates billions of dollars of interstate wholesale energy transactions.
21/wsj_2158:CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT Corp. said its directors declared a dividend of five cents per Class A common stock payable Nov. 6 to stock of record Oct. 16.
21/wsj_2158:The dividend represents the balance of its regular quarterly payout of 10 cents a share, of which half was paid July 17 in a final distribution prior to its merger with B.B. Real Estate Investment Corp., also in July.
21/wsj_2158:The company said it hopes to resume its schedule of regular quarterly dividends at the end of this year. 
21/wsj_2159:The provincially owned utility said it is tearing up the deal because "the contract's objectives can't be fulfilled." Hydro-Quebec said Maine regulators' refusal to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried through Maine to other utilities. "It would now be physically impossible to begin deliveries in 1992," a Hydro-Quebec official said.
21/wsj_2159:Under the contract Hydro-Quebec was to supply 400 megawatts of power to Central Maine Power starting in 1992, 600 megawatts starting in 1995 and 900 megawatts starting in 
21/wsj_2159:He said Hydro-Quebec already has some "customers in mind" for the power that was to be delivered to Maine. "Nothing has happened since we signed the contract to undermine our conviction that Hydro-Quebec was the lowest-cost, most environmentally acceptable choice for meeting a part of our customers' energy needs through the year 2020," said Central Maine senior vice president Donald F. Kelly. 
21/wsj_2160:CHICAGO - Options traders were among the big victims of Friday's plunging stock market, including one small firm that required an emergency $50 million bailout. 
21/wsj_2160:Options traders were hurt worse than others on Friday because of the highly volatile nature of options, which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based.
21/wsj_2160:Jeffrey Miller of Miller Tabak Hirsch & Co. said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market, it is "very easy for these guys to get wiped out.
21/wsj_2160:That may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures." 
21/wsj_2160:An options contract gives the holder the right to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific amount of stock, or in this case the value of a stock index, based on a predetermined price within a given time period.
21/wsj_2160:The latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which has never fully recovered from the aftershock of Black Monday, when investors fled the market because of huge losses. 
21/wsj_2160:Exchange officials reasoned that they wouldn't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining Friday afternoon, and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time, the CBOE reasoned that its best course was to remain closed. 
21/wsj_2160:The damage was so bad at Fossett Corp., an options trading firm here, that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago, a unit of Continental Bank Corp., as a result of options trading losses.
21/wsj_2160:Fosset so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of Friday's rout. 
21/wsj_2160:Fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after Friday's close of trading, but not enough that regulators, worried about another potential market plunge yesterday, would let it reopen for trading, options exchange officials said. 
21/wsj_2160:Thus, in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer, the CBOE, the American Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp., as well as the firm's owner, Stephen Fossett, put up a total of $50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday. 
21/wsj_2160:S. Waite Rawls III, vice chairman of Continental Bank, First Options' parent company, said the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held by Fossett, almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders. 
21/wsj_2160:"Steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money," Mr. Rawls said. "A package of credit support was put together -- including the assets of Steve and his firm." 
21/wsj_2160:The bailout was cobbled together over the weekend, with officials from the Federal Reserve Board, Securities and Exchange Commission, Comptroller of the Currency and Treasury as well as the options exchanges. "It was great to have the luxury of time," Mr. Rawls said. 
21/wsj_2160:At one point, an options industry official had to talk the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's night watchman into giving him the home phone number of Silas Keene, Chicago Fed president. 
21/wsj_2160:Officials at Options Clearing Corp., which processes all options trades for U.S. exchanges, said that the $50 million guarantee was unprecedented, but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets. "It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps," said Paul Stevens, OCC president and chief operating officer. 
21/wsj_2161:With a jazz-piano tape playing softly in the background, the soothing hands of Sabina Vidunas begin to work on Ms. Foster's neck and shoulders. "It's like an oasis in this room," Ms. Foster purrs.
21/wsj_2161:The room in question is the directors' lounge of H.J. Heinz Co., 60 floors above the bustle of Pittsburgh.
21/wsj_2161:Nor does it at all resemble (despite what some executives think) the more intimate variety offered at specialty parlors in bad parts of town.
21/wsj_2161:Some companies, including Heinz, even pay part of the fee.
21/wsj_2161:"Sometimes, with the release of stress, you hear `oohs' and `ahs' coming out of the room," explains Morgan Banks, the agency's health specialist. "And you can't have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing `oohs' and `ahs. '" 
21/wsj_2161:Last year, the research and development division of Weyerhaeuser Co., the large wood-products concern, invited a masseuse to its Tacoma, Wash., offices.
21/wsj_2161:Phil Harms, a software engineer, was an eager customer. "You build up a lot of tension working at a terminal all day," he says. 
21/wsj_2161:But after about eight months, the vice president of the division, Ed Soule, learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt.
21/wsj_2161:Mr. Soule says his only beef was that the massages were being given in a company conference room; the department's supervised health facility would have been fine. "In my view, {massages} should be managed with an appropriate mixture of males and females around," he says. 
21/wsj_2161:Russell Borner of Park Ridge, N.J., says he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in New York -- unbeknownst to the company's executives.
21/wsj_2161:"This is common with a lot of large companies," says Mr. Borner, who worked for American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for 23 years before choosing his current trade.
21/wsj_2161:Managers, he contends, "are afraid how they're going to look in the eyes of their peers.
21/wsj_2161:My attitude is: Let's come out of the closet." 
21/wsj_2161:Elisa Byler, a St. Louis masseuse, won over officials at Emerson Electric Co., a maker of electrical and electronic equipment, by providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage.
21/wsj_2161:The self-proclaimed father of on-site massage is David Palmer, a 41-year-old San Francisco masseur whose mission is to save the touch-starved masses.
21/wsj_2161:Sitting in one of Mr. Palmer's chairs, which cost $425 and have since been copied by others, is a bit like straddling a recliner.
21/wsj_2161:Customers lean forward, rest their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of the chair. (Ms.
21/wsj_2161:Ohlman, the Grand Rapids masseuse, says she has heard the odd-looking contraption compared to something out of the Spanish Inquisition.) 
21/wsj_2161:Mr. Palmer, who serves as president of the On-Site Massage Association and writes an industry newsletter, says some 4,000 practitioners -- out of about 50,000 certified masseurs across the country -- now use massage chairs in the workplace, as well as on street corners, in airports and malls, and at conventions and other gatherings where weary people can be found. 
21/wsj_2161:Scot MacInnis, a masseur in Boulder, Colo., had a scary experience while massaging a man in a natural-foods supermarket as part of a store promotion.
21/wsj_2161:Despite the number of fans that office massage has won, some purists look down on it, arguing that naked, full-body rubs are the only way to go.
21/wsj_2161:Linda Aldridge, who does full-body work in Pittsburgh, says that while on-site massage is better than nothing, tired workers should realize it is only the tip of the iceberg. 
21/wsj_2161:"Whole areas of their bodies are neglected," she says, adding that clothes ruin the experience. "There's nothing like skin to skin." 
21/wsj_2162:In what is believed to be the first cancellation of a loan to China since the June 4 killings in Beijing, an international bank syndicate has terminated a $55 million credit for a Shanghai property project. 
21/wsj_2162:But several weeks ago, in the wake of the Beijing killings, the loan was canceled, according to bankers and executives close to the project.
21/wsj_2162:While some commercial lending has resumed, international lenders remain nervous about China's economic troubles and foreign debt -- $40 billion at the end of 1988. 
21/wsj_2162:When the loan agreement was announced, it was hailed as one of the first Western-style financing transactions ever used in China.
21/wsj_2162:Instead, the banks secured a promise from state-owned Bank of Communications that it would lend Asia Development the entire $55 million at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing.
21/wsj_2162:The bank syndicate is made up mostly of European banks, but it includes China's state-owned Citic Industrial Bank. 
21/wsj_2162:The 11 banks in the syndicate sustained no monetary losses because none of the credit facility had been drawn down. 
21/wsj_2163:The proposed merger comes as K mart's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. K mart, based in Troy, Mich., recently said net income would fall for the third consecutive quarter, after a 16% drop in the first half of its current fiscal year. 
21/wsj_2163:Shoppers, many of whom operate small businesses, pay annual membership fees, which provide an income base for the stores. 
21/wsj_2163:K mart tested the warehouse-club sector last year with its acquisition of a 51% interest in Makro Inc.
21/wsj_2163:But the Makro chain, which operates as a joint venture between K mart and SHV Holdings N.V. of the Netherlands, has only six stores and annual sales that one analyst estimated at about $300 million. 
21/wsj_2163:In the year ended Jan. 31, Pace rang up profit of $9.4 million, or 72 cents a share, after a tax-loss carry-forward, on sales of $1.3 billion, and analysts expect its results to continue to improve. 
21/wsj_2163:"The company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability," said Margo McGlade of PaineWebber Inc., who had been forecasting a 46% jump in Pace's net income from operations this year and another 42% increase next year. "Warehouse productivity is really beginning to take off." 
21/wsj_2163:But some analysts contend K mart has agreed to pay too much for Pace. "Even if you look at it as a turnaround situation, it's expensive," said Wayne Hood of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "In my opinion, you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry." 
21/wsj_2163:Ms. McGlade of PaineWebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal. "If K mart can't get its act together in discounting, why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets?" She said, "I would say K mart's number one job is to address its market-share loss {in discount stores}, which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins.
21/wsj_2163:Under terms of the agreement, a K mart subsidiary will soon make a tender offer for Pace shares.
21/wsj_2163:Among the conditions of the offer is that Pace shareholders tender a majority of the company's shares outstanding.
21/wsj_2164:G. William Ryan, president of Post-Newsweek Stations, was named chief executive officer of the unit of this media company, effective Jan. 1.
21/wsj_2164:He will succeed Joel Chaseman, who will remain a vice president of the company and continue to represent Post-Newsweek stations in several industry organizations, the company said. 
21/wsj_2165:"It was crazy," said Neil Weisman, general partner of Chilmark Capital Corp. "It was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane." 
21/wsj_2165:Quotron Systems Inc., a Citicorp unit, blamed the 30-minute foul-up on "a timing problem in our software" caused by the enormous early volume -- about 145 million shares in the first hour of New York Stock Exchange trading.
21/wsj_2165:The prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct, Quotron said, but the average was wrong. 
21/wsj_2165:Meanwhile, there was an awful lot of confusion.
21/wsj_2165:At about 10:40 a.m. on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm, a veteran trader who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked, "What's going on?
21/wsj_2165:Holly Stark, a vice president who heads the trading desk at Dillon Read Capital Corp., said that once she figured out the Quotron numbers were wrong, she called brokers to tell them. "It's been kind of annoying, to say the least," she said.
21/wsj_2165:When the market opened at 9:30 a.m. EST, a reporter for the Reuters newswire miscalculated the industrial average's drop as a 4% decline when it really was down 0.7%. "It was a case of human error, which we found almost immediately and corrected," a spokesman for Reuter in New York said. 
21/wsj_2165:At the start of trading last Wednesday, the average appeared to plunge more than 200 points.
21/wsj_2165:"Today of all days," she lamented. "The eyes of the world were watching us." 
21/wsj_2166:Steven F. Kaplan was named a senior vice president of this graphics equipment company.
21/wsj_2166:He retains his current positions as chief strategic officer of AM International and president of AM Ventures. 
21/wsj_2167:It turns out Mr. Friend's client, Machelle Parks of Cincinnati, didn't like the way defense attorney Tom Alexander acted during the legal proceedings.
21/wsj_2167:The bizarre arrangement grows out of Mr. Alexander's representation of Derr Construction Co., one of several defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Ms. Parks, the widow of a construction worker killed in January 1987 while working on a new Houston convention center.
21/wsj_2167:Last month, Mr. Friend says, Mr. Alexander's associate agreed that Derr would pay $50,000 as part of an overall settlement. 
21/wsj_2167:Mr. Alexander says he regards the agreement, which hasn't been submitted to a judge, as something of a joke.
21/wsj_2167:However, he acknowledges they "have the option of taking a swat at me if they really want to." Mr. Friend says his side is "dead serious." Although they don't contemplate delivering any disabling blows, he says that Mr. Alexander will be asked to sign a release from liability, just in case. 
21/wsj_2168:After two years of drought, it rained money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday. 
21/wsj_2168:The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders to reap six-figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared, traders said. 
21/wsj_2168:The S&P 500 futures contract, which moves in fractions of an index point under normal conditions, jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn, then moved strongly higher the rest of the day.
21/wsj_2168:Since the crash, many futures traders haven't assumed large positions for fear that the S&P 500 market, with much of its customer order flow missing, would dry up if prices turned against them. 
21/wsj_2168:Traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8:30 am 
21/wsj_2168:The market hovered near Friday's closing price of 328.85 for about a half hour, moving several index points higher or lower in seconds, then broke higher and didn't look back. 
21/wsj_2168:The S&P 500 contract that expires in December closed up a record 15.65 points on volume of nearly 80,000 contracts. 
21/wsj_2168:Several of Wall Street's largest securities firms, including Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Inc., were also large buyers, traders said.
21/wsj_2168:Salomon Brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index futures last week, traders said.
21/wsj_2168:"With the FBI around here, bragging rights are a thing of the past," said one trader, referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far has resulted in 46 indictments lodged against individuals on the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade. 
21/wsj_2169:The market for $200 billion of high-yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from Friday's plunge. 
21/wsj_2169:No trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds, securities industry officials said.
21/wsj_2169:"Nothing traded on Friday, and people weren't really sure where the market should have opened" yesterday, said Raymond Minella, co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co. "But we had a fairly active day yesterday." 
21/wsj_2169:At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the leading underwriter of junk bonds, "I was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight," said David Feinman, a junk bond trader. "Now, I feel maybe there's a little bit of euphoria." But before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday, he said, "You couldn't buy {junk bonds} and you couldn't give them away." 
21/wsj_2169:But traders said the junk bond market increasingly is separating into a top-tier group, in which trades can be executed easily, and a larger group of lower-quality bonds in which liquidity -- or the ability to trade without too much difficulty -- has steadily deteriorated this year. 
21/wsj_2169:"Liquidity hasn't returned to the vast middle ground of the market," said Mr. Minella of Merrill. 
21/wsj_2169:"The deadbeats are still deadbeats," said Mr. Feinman of Drexel. 
21/wsj_2169:Analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain treacherous for investors.
21/wsj_2169:Paul Asquith, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later, says, "We're now in a period where we're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986." 
21/wsj_2169:Mark Bachmann, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's Corp., confirms that there is "increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market." 
21/wsj_2169:"Junk bonds are a highly stratified market," said Lewis Glucksman, vice chairman of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "There's a whole bunch of stuff that's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that's not so good." 
21/wsj_2169:Almost $8 billion of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from SCI TV, Gillette Holdings (not related to Gillette Co.), Interco, Seaman Furniture, Allied Stores, Federated Department Stores, National Gypsum, M.D.C. Holdings, Micropolis, Leaseway Transportation and Price Communications. 
21/wsj_2169:"You could still have some very bad times ahead," said Mr. Bachmann. "It's possible to have a 10% default rate in one year, because we're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy.
21/wsj_2169:Many issues "bounced off the floor," Mr. Minella said, and benchmark junk issues "recovered all of their losses" from Friday and early yesterday.
21/wsj_2169:In addition, mutual funds didn't appear to be major sellers of high-yield securities as was expected. 
21/wsj_2170:That's a question a lot of people are asking, following the stock market's stunning display of volatility.
21/wsj_2170:"If you look at 75 years worth of investment history -- including the Great Depression and every bear market since -- stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot," says Barry Berlin, vice president at First Wachovia Capital Management. 
21/wsj_2170:A dollar invested in the stock market in 1926 would have grown to $473.29 by the end of last June, according to Laurence Siegel, managing director at Ibbotson Associates Inc.
21/wsj_2170:The longer the time period, the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market.
21/wsj_2170:For instance, Ken Gregory, a San Francisco money manager, calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the chance of losing money is 3% to 4% over a 10-year period, compared with 15% over three years and 30% over one year. 
21/wsj_2170:"If you don't need the money for 10 years, there's a clear-cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks," Mr. Gregory says. 
21/wsj_2170:Stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns, says John Blankenship Jr., president of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners.
21/wsj_2170:There are some important caveats: Before investing in stocks, individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank, most investment advisers say.
21/wsj_2170:Individuals also should focus on building equity in a home, which provides some protection against inflation, as well as a nest-egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living. 
21/wsj_2170:But once the basics are covered, "then I would start to invest, even if it's as little as $1,000," says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc.
21/wsj_2170:Individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market.
21/wsj_2170:The cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order, but 2% of the order's value is an average, says Stephen Boesel, manager of T. Rowe Price's Growth and Income mutual fund. 
21/wsj_2170:Then, too, many individual investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market. 
21/wsj_2170:So what's the best way to buy stocks? "Unless an individual has a minimum of between $50,000 and $100,000 to invest in stocks, he's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks, in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker," says Mr. Lipper. 
21/wsj_2170:This growth sector, which usually carries a price/earnings multiple about twice that of the Standard & Poor's 500, happens to include some of the market's most attractive bargains right now. "It's now selling at a multiple about even with the market," says Mr. Douglas. 
21/wsj_2170:Moreover, Mr. Douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term.
21/wsj_2170:Many big Wall Street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now resuming coverage of this area, he notes. "We're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks," he says. 
21/wsj_2170:They say that's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle, when there's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes. 
21/wsj_2170:In the long run, investment advisers say, most investors will be better off using the dollar-cost averaging method of buying stocks.
21/wsj_2170:A disciplined program will work the best, Mr. Boesel says. "One of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down," he says. "But's that just the time when you should be buying them." 
21/wsj_2171:Gehl Co., initial public offering of two million shares of common stock, of which 1,450,635 shares are being offered by the company and 549,365 shares by holders, via Blunt, Ellis & Loewi Inc. and Robert W. Baird & Co. 
21/wsj_2171:Giant Industries Inc., initial public offering of 3,111,000 common shares, of which 2,425,000 will be sold by the company, and the rest by holders, via Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Hanifen, Imhoff Inc. 
21/wsj_2171:Inefficient-Market Fund Inc., initial offering of five million common shares, via Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. 
21/wsj_2171:Jason Overseas Ltd., initial offering of four million common shares, of which 3.2 million will be sold in the U.S., and the balance outside the U.S., via Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. and Mabon, Nugent & Co. 
21/wsj_2172:Mr. Trump, who vowed Wednesday to "go forward" with the bid, said he was dropping it "in light of the recent change in market conditions." He said he might now sell his AMR stake, buy more shares, or make another offer at a lower price. 
21/wsj_2172:UAL tumbled $56.875 to $222.875 on volume of 2.3 million shares, and AMR declined by $22.125 to $76.50 as 4.7 million shares changed hands.
21/wsj_2172:Together, the two stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock traders, and caused a 7.3% drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, second in size only to the stock-market crash of Oct. 19, 1987. 
21/wsj_2172:Some said Friday's market debacle had given Mr. Trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the UAL deal.
21/wsj_2172:After reaching an intraday high of $107.50 the day Mr. Trump disclosed his bid Oct. 5, AMR's stock had retreated as low as $97.75 last week. 
21/wsj_2172:Some takeover stock traders had been betting against Mr. Trump because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets, then selling at a profit without making a bid. 
21/wsj_2172:"He still hasn't proven his mettle as a big-league take-out artist," said airline analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley & Co. "He's done this thing where he'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it.
21/wsj_2172:He's written this book, `The Art of the Deal. ' Why doesn't he just follow through on one of these things?" 
21/wsj_2172:AMR had weighed a wide range of possible responses, from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees, a friendlier buyer such as Texas billionaire Robert Bass, or both. 
21/wsj_2172:AMR had also sought to foil Mr. Trump in Congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the Transportation Department to reject airline buy-outs.
21/wsj_2172:Yesterday, Mr. Trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the UAL deal on Congress, saying it was rushing through a bill to protect AMR executives. 
21/wsj_2172:"I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the UAL transaction, and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past Friday," Mr. Trump wrote members of Congress. 
21/wsj_2172:Mr. Trump never said how much AMR stock he had bought, only that his holdings were "substantial." However, he only received federal clearance to buy more than $15 million of the stock on Sept. 20, when the price rose $2 a share to $78.50.
21/wsj_2172:Assuming that he paid a rough average price of $80 a share, and assuming he didn't sell before his announcement reached the market, Mr. Trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $76.50. 
21/wsj_2172:Some analysts said AMR Chairman Robert Crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation's largest airline with a defensive transaction, such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees.
21/wsj_2172:Ray Neidl of Dillon Read & Co. said Mr. Trump "is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle.
21/wsj_2172:Citibank and Chase had agreed to commit $3 billion, and said they were "highly confident" of raising another $4.2 billion. 
21/wsj_2172:Together, Citicorp and Chase received $8 million in fees to raise the rest of the financing.
21/wsj_2172:Nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders.
21/wsj_2172:Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis, whose $275-a-share offer was rejected by UAL's board, hasn't shown signs of pursuing a $300-a-share back-up bid he made last month. 
21/wsj_2172:In addition, the coalition of labor and management, longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of Mr. Davis's bid, could break apart now.
21/wsj_2172:Union Chairman F.C. (Rick) Dubinsky faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy-out the members approved overwhelmingly last week. 
21/wsj_2172:If they were to insist on a low bid of, say $200 a share, the board mightn't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose. 
21/wsj_2173:To impose "a little bit more discipline" on the budget process, Budget Director Richard Darman said he won't give agencies much flexibility to shift funds among different programs as a means of coping with the law's requirements. 
21/wsj_2173:Nevertheless, it may add to pressure on the House to follow the Senate's lead and strip from pending budget legislation scores of costly, extraneous provisions. 
21/wsj_2173:House Republicans also are reluctant to pare down the 1,878-page measure -- at least until they are guaranteed that the provisions they care about will get another vote. "A lot of the guys . . . don't want it all to just die," said House GOP leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.). 
21/wsj_2173:Foley and Michel had agreed to streamline the deficit-reduction bill before the House even took it up, but Mr. Darman and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu had torpedoed that plan in order to press their fight for a cut in capital-gains taxes. 
21/wsj_2173:Even before the size of yesterday's rebound in stock prices was known, Mr. Darman said that Friday's plunge "would have no significant effect on the budget process." 
21/wsj_2173:When the fiscal year began on Oct. 1, the Office of Management and Budget began withholding 4.3% of the Pentagon's money and 5.3% of other agencies' money, as the Gramm-Rudman law requires.
21/wsj_2173:Under a special provision of the law, the government yesterday began slicing 2% from Medicare payments made to doctors and hospitals. 
21/wsj_2173:Nearly two-thirds of all federal spending -- including Social Security payments and salaries of current federal employees -- is exempt from the Gramm-Rudman cuts.
21/wsj_2173:The rest of the government will be pinched, perhaps within a month, if the cut funds aren't restored. 
21/wsj_2173:Until yesterday, OMB had indicated it would cut at the "account" level; each account is comprised of many programs, projects or activities. 
21/wsj_2173:Mr. Darman said the new approach will give agencies "less ability to shift from one area to another . . . to fudge over things." But at least for some major spending programs, government budget experts said, OMB hasn't any significant control of individual programs, projects or activities. 
21/wsj_2173:First to suffer from the spending cuts will be programs that spend most of their money on personnel, Mr. Darman said.
21/wsj_2173:Mr. Darman also said yesterday that although the administration isn't any longer pushing to include a cut in capital-gains taxes as part of the 1990 budget legislation, the odds are 8-to-5 in favor of winning approval for capital gains taxes this year. 
21/wsj_2174:Mr. Wallach, 55 years old, was convicted in August of racketeering and conspiring to commit fraud.
21/wsj_2174:The charges involved $425,000 in payments he got from Wedtech in return for promising to use his influence with Mr. Meese and other federal officials on behalf of the now-defunct defense contractor. 
21/wsj_2174:At the sentencing in federal court in New York, Judge Owen told Mr. Wallach: "You sold your federal office and the integrity of your federal office for $300,000 before you even got the office." 
21/wsj_2174:The money was allegedly paid to Mr. Wallach in anticipation of his being appointed to a top position in the Justice Department, but that appointment was never made.
21/wsj_2174:The defendants, who remain free on bail pending their appeals, would have to serve a third of their sentences before being eligible for parole.
21/wsj_2174:Before issuing the sentences, Judge Owen criticized Mr. Wallach for a host of alleged ethical and legal improprieties, some of which had nothing to do with the Wedtech case and most of which involved Mr. Meese.
21/wsj_2174:About halfway through the verdict, Mr. London's mother had a seizure and collapsed in the front row of the courtroom.
21/wsj_2174:He said prosecutors "were looking for a man between Ed Meese and Wedtech. . . . If they could have gotten Ed Meese that would have been the fulfillment of the dreams." 
21/wsj_2174:According to a corrected pre-sentencing report, Mr. Wallach currently has a negative net worth of $273,000. 
21/wsj_2174:U.S. District Judge David Edelstein of New York ruled that the elections officer will play an extensive role in all phases of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters' 1991 election of top union officials. 
21/wsj_2174:The government hailed the ruling as a major victory in its quest to achieve broad reforms in the union, particularly the election of top officials by the rank and file. 
21/wsj_2174:But Teamsters counsel James Grady claimed that the power bestowed upon the court-appointed officer was a departure from the terms of the union's agreement with the government earlier this year.
21/wsj_2174:Mr. Grady added that to fund the type of supervision Judge Edelstein described would cost the union at least $3.5 million. 
21/wsj_2174:In March, the Teamsters agreed to a settlement of civil racketeering charges brought by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.
21/wsj_2174:But in his first progress report, filed two weeks ago, Administrator Frederick B. Lacey revealed some disagreements over the scope of such oversight, the interpretation of the settlement, and financial support. 
21/wsj_2174:After the judge's ruling, Mr. Grady said, "We gave up our right to a trial for the terms of the {agreement}, and we believe that anything that modifies those terms is completely inappropriate." 
21/wsj_2174:A special master, appointed by the Texas Supreme Court, received evidence yesterday about comments made by Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton in the wake of a murder trial in December. 
21/wsj_2174:The commission, which could remove Judge Hampton from the bench, will act after reviewing findings to be submitted within two weeks by special master Robert R. Murray of San Antonio. 
21/wsj_2174:At a hearing yesterday, Judge Hampton's defense team, which included former Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade and former U.S. Attorney Jim Rolfe, accused the Times Herald reporter of misquoting the judge.
21/wsj_2174:But Bill Hornung, general counsel for the judicial-conduct commission, said the defense team was sidestepping the focus of the inquiry -- whether Judge Hampton violated judicial ethics by commenting to the public while a motion for new trial was pending. 
21/wsj_2174:"The place where a judge can comment and explain his rationale {for sentencing} is from the bench . . . not in the privacy of a little impromptu press conference," Mr. Hornung said. 
21/wsj_2174:Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), committee chairman, proposed legislation that would carry out the streamlining of death-penalty appeals in federal court that was proposed last month by a special task force appointed by Chief Justice of the U.S. William Rehnquist.
21/wsj_2174:Sen. Biden proposed the legislation to comply with a law passed last year requiring the Senate to expedite consideration of proposals made by the task force, led by retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell. 
21/wsj_2174:The task force proposed that states provide lawyers to death-row inmates for civil, post-conviction lawsuits, called habeas corpus cases, in which they challenge the constitutionality of their convictions.
21/wsj_2174:In exchange, the number of such lawsuits each inmate may file would be sharply curtailed, allowing states greater certainty of being able to execute those on death row.
21/wsj_2174:When Chief Justice Rehnquist sent the report to Congress, a majority of federal judges on the policy-making Judicial Conference complained they hadn't been given a chance to consider the recommendations. 
21/wsj_2174:But the senator's bill eases a number of the restrictions. 
21/wsj_2174:APPLE COMPUTER Inc. 's former general counsel John P. Karalis joined the Phoenix, Ariz., law firm of Brown & Bain.
21/wsj_2175:A surge in sales in August helped trim inventory levels of U.S. businesses, Commerce Department figures show. 
21/wsj_2175:As a result, inventories fell back to the equivalent of 1.5 months of sales.
21/wsj_2175:Inventories had been running at about this level -- one that economists regard as manageable -- for much of the year before they jumped to 1.54 months in July. 
21/wsj_2175:In July, business inventories had climbed 0.9%, a number the department revised from its initial report of 0.6%.
21/wsj_2175:Here is a summary of the Commerce Department's report on business inventories and sales in in August.
21/wsj_2175:The figures are in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted: 
21/wsj_2176:Pall Corp. said it expects a reduction in net income for the first quarter ended Oct. 28 of about $2 million, or five cents a share, as a result of Hurricane Hugo. 
21/wsj_2176:The maker of disposable filters said revenue will be reduced about $3 million because of damage done by the hurricane to the company's three plants in Puerto Rico.
21/wsj_2176:In the year-earlier quarter, Pall had net of $8.3 million, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $100.5 million. 
21/wsj_2177:Christie's and Sotheby's, the two major New York houses, are about to offer a large number of impressionist and modern paintings at estimates unheard of even five years ago.
21/wsj_2177:More than $600 million of impressionist and modern paintings are about to hit the New York auction block -- far outstripping May's four-day $400 million bonanza.
21/wsj_2177:This season Lorinda de Roulet (sister of John Whitney Payson, for whom "Irises" by Vincent van Gogh was sold for $53.9 million in November of 1987, to the Australian Alan Bond, who still hasn't taken possession because he hasn't yet paid off the loan Sotheby's offered him at the sale) has consigned another biggie to Sotheby's. "Au Lapin Agile" is a 1905 Rose Period Picasso being billed as "the most important 20th-century picture ever to come up for auction." It may sell for more than any previous Picasso -- the record is $47.85 million set in May for "Self Portrait: Yo Picasso." 
21/wsj_2177:Sotheby's also weighs in with the John T. Dorrance Jr. collection of impressionists at an estimated $100 million-plus (to be offered tomorrow) and a juicy assortment of paintings from other sources, more than 35 of which are expected to sell in November for at least $1 million each. 
21/wsj_2177:Christie's has snagged the 15 impressionist and modern paintings being pruned from Paul Mellon's vast collection, including the probable $30 million-plus "Rue Mosnier, Paris, Decorated With Flags on June 30, 1878" by Edouard Manet (purchased by Mellon at the Jacob Goldschmidt sale in London in 1958 for $316,400) and a van Gogh, "Trunk of an Old Yew Tree, Arles," estimated at $25 million-plus. 
21/wsj_2177:Other one-owner collections include Billy Wilder's more modest but choice offerings, and the George N. Richard collection -- piled on top of Christie's estimated $150 million -- $200 million of other impressionist goodies.
21/wsj_2177:"A strong art market is bringing out paintings I never expected to see on the market," says David Nash, director of Sotheby's Fine Arts Division.
21/wsj_2177:But since the 1986 tax laws drastically reduced deductions for the donation of appreciated property and reduced overall tax rates (thereby making deductions less significant), charitable donations to museums, when anyone makes them, are very charitable indeed.
21/wsj_2177:Of the current group of paintings, it's hard to say which, in the days before tax reform, might have been donated instead of sold.
21/wsj_2177:Philadelphia Museum head Anne d'Harnoncourt insists that even though John Dorrance may have been the chairman of her Board of Trustees, "We weren't expecting the pictures we didn't get." 
21/wsj_2177:Although Sotheby's points out that it is "an international organization" not specifically concerned with potential losses to American museums, others are up in arms: "Donations have always been the main source of increased museum collections," says Edward H. Able Jr., executive director of the American Association of Museums. "Now there is a hemorrhaging of this country's patrimony." According to a study conducted by the Association of Art Museum Directors, the drop in the dollar value of donated works of art since 1986 is more than 50%. "This is just the tip of the iceberg, because no major collector has died recently," says Christopher Burge, president of Christie's America. "The next 10 years are going to be a wasteland for American museums." 
21/wsj_2177:Major attractions have out-of-town tryouts. "Au Lapin Agile," some of the Mellon paintings, and others went around the world on a series of whistle-stop exhibition tours; Billy Wilder's pictures went to a party at the Beverly Hills Hotel; and the Dorrance paintings hung for five days in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. (Even Sotheby's PR department couldn't have pulled that one off; Dorrance's executors "requested" it.) 
21/wsj_2177:The weak dollar makes our market a playground for foreign bidders, and our sorry balance of trade has given them plenty of dollars to play with. "In many ways the Japanese -- particularly Japanese corporations -- dictate art price levels," says Susan Seidel of William Beadleston, a New York private dealing concern. "They are willing to pay almost anything." 
21/wsj_2177:But the stakes are now very high and for your $40 million you can buy only the best of what is available -- which may not be the best there is.
21/wsj_2177:For some, the social status that can be acquired in this way is the point of the game. "They buy the co-op, they buy the cars," says Ms. Seidel. "Then they buy `brand names' like Picasso to put on the wall." 
21/wsj_2177:But at these price levels, confidence in the "investment" potential of major paintings must be playing a part in fueling the collecting frenzy.
21/wsj_2177:Big-bucks buyers trust that the market will continue its strong surge. "In October of '87 people saw that everything else went down but art went up," Desmond Corcoran of London's Alex Reid & Lefevre Ltd. gallery points out.
21/wsj_2177:Since then, the market has continued to rise, but now the size of the estimates seems to be making some people nervous. "Zey are crazee!" shrieked one French dealer, reeling from auction estimate sticker shock. 
21/wsj_2177:In a lower key, Mr. Corcoran finds the world "full of strange speculators" and the auction estimates "incredible," and suggests the Dorrance sale as a sort of early warning system: "These pictures are not absolutely top quality," he says. "So if the market absorbs those, what comes three weeks later will do just fine." 
21/wsj_2177:If all goes well, if the Picasso hits $75 million, and Mellon, Dorrance, Wilder and the rest get what they bargained for, the uncomfortable, questioning buzz in the art marketplace will trail off into sighs of relief, only to begin anew slightly louder than before, as the cycle starts over in the spring.
21/wsj_2177:Because for some, the art market has become a sort of magic beanstalk rising into the clouds at a cartoon rate of speed.
21/wsj_2178:A spokesman for the maker of electronic equipment and semiconductors said Motorola doesn't expect the transaction to have a material impact on earnings. 
21/wsj_2178:Tegal, a Petaluma, Calif., supplier to the semiconductor industry, has annual sales of about $55 million. 
21/wsj_2179:Securities and Exchange Commission officials said they called heads of firms, traders and other brokerage staffers to make sure the houses had enough capital and back-office resources to handle the crush of sell orders during the first few hours of trading yesterday. 
21/wsj_2179:"We're very concerned about the financial well-being of the firms," said Martin Kuperberg, who runs the SEC's New York broker-dealer unit. "We've spoken to a number of people both at the {exchanges} and at the firms." 
21/wsj_2179:Meanwhile, SEC officials in Washington held a series of discussions with officials from the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the exchanges, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Council of Economic Advisers to see whether market mechanisms were working properly. 
21/wsj_2179:Today's developments demonstrate the value of the significant improvements that have been made in trading systems over the past two years." 
21/wsj_2179:The default of several Wall Street houses that ran short of liquidity during the 1987 crash is a fresh memory for regulators and the exchanges.
21/wsj_2179:Two weeks ago, for example, the agency censured Prudential Insurance Co. of America's Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. for failing to adequately keep track of customers' funds.
21/wsj_2179:The move was in part a warning to firms that the SEC will try to crack down on firms if their back offices aren't in order and become a danger in the event of a major market move. "It notifies the broker-dealer community that we won't tolerate this kind of action," Mr. Kuperberg said. 
21/wsj_2179:Separately, the National Association of Securities Dealers dispatched 25 examiners into brokerages' trading rooms to make sure brokers were answering phones and handling customer orders properly.
21/wsj_2180:Storage Technology Corp. said it signed a letter of intent to acquire M4 Data Inc. of Britain. 
21/wsj_2181:Martha O. Hesse, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since 1986, was named senior vice president for corporate affairs, effective about the beginning of next year.
21/wsj_2181:Cleveland Museum of Art: "American Cities: The Artist's View" -- Nearly 50 prints, drawings, paintings and photographs dating from the 1850s to the present explore how different artists have interpreted the urban scene.
21/wsj_2181:Included are Joseph Pennell's lithographs of New York City in the 1900s; six black-and-white photos of Cleveland steel mills by Margaret Bourke-White; and Wayne Thiebaud's contemporary views of San Francisco. 11150 East Boulevard.
21/wsj_2181:Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia: "Making Their Mark: Women Artists Move Into the Mainstream 1970-85" -- More than 160 works by painters, sculptors and photographers, as well as tapes and documentation by 33 video and performance artists.
21/wsj_2181:Metropolitan Museum, New York: "Gold of Africa: The Barbier-Mueller Collection" showcases a king's ransom of West African artifacts culled from a renowned Swiss collection.
21/wsj_2181:The 130 objects on display range from a whimsical bestiary of gilded sword ornaments to the dazzling raiment of Ghanaian rulers. 82nd St. and Fifth Ave.
21/wsj_2181:Cavin-Morris Gallery, New York: "Gregory Van Maanen" -- Many of the forceful, heavily symbolic images of this self-taught artist were partly inspired by his service in Vietnam, and carry titles such as "Death in Flight" and "Germans Are Born With Helmet Shaped Skulls." 100 Hudson St., Oct. 19-Nov. 25. 
21/wsj_2181:Joffrey Ballet: The company's six-week Manhattan season features a pair of premieres -- "Les Noces," Bronislava Nijinska's celebrated 1923 collaboration with Stravinsky; and "The Pantages and the Palace Present TWO-A-DAY," artistic director Gerald Arpino's salute to vaudeville.
21/wsj_2181:Other highlights include the revival of "Trinity," Mr. Arpino's rock-scored salute to the Sixties, and, beginning Nov. 24, the late Robert Joffrey's version of "The Nutcracker." City Center, 131 West 55th St., Oct. 24-Dec. 2. (212) 581-7907. 
21/wsj_2181:San Diego Opera opens its 25th season with Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov," featuring five leading singers and a conductor from the Soviet Union. (The opera also opens the San Diego Arts Festival: Treasures of the Soviet Union.) Bass Alexander Morozov of the Leningrad Kirov Opera sings the title role; mezzo soprano Irina Bogacheva is the scheming Polish princess Marina.
21/wsj_2181:Jeff Beck and Stevie Ray Vaughan: For many rock fans, this double bill of the rarely seen British legend Beck and Texas tornado Vaughan will spell guitar heaven: Minneapolis (Northrop Memorial Auditorium), Oct. 25; Milwaukee (Mecca Auditorium), Oct. 27; Chicago (UIC Pavillion), Oct. 28; St. Louis (Fox Theatre), Oct. 29; Columbus, Ohio (Ohio Theatre), Oct. 31; Toronto (Sky Dome), Nov. 2; Detroit (Cobo Arena), Nov. 3; Pittsburgh (Palumbo Center), Nov. 4; Landover, Md. (Capitol Centre), Nov. 6; Philadelphia (Spectrum), Nov. 7; Worcester, Mass. (Centrum), Nov. 8; Manhattan (Madison Square Garden), Nov. 11; Cleveland (Public Hall), Nov. 14; Dayton, Ohio (Hara Arena), Nov. 15; Louisville, Ky. (Louisville Gardens), Nov. 16; Birmingham, Ala.

21/wsj_2182:The News agreed to pay a minimum of $100,000 annually for five years for the features, and an unusual $500,000 fee, mostly up front, to keep all current and future Universal offerings for itself in the Dallas area. 
21/wsj_2182:The move was a stunning coup, nabbing some of the Times Herald's biggest draws, including "Dear Abby," "Doonesbury," Erma Bombeck's column and "The Far Side." It also reignited a long-running newspaper war that had cooled last year after closely held DTH Media Inc. bought the Times Herald. 
21/wsj_2182:"We're very concerned," says Tom King, the editor and president of the El Paso Herald-Post, a Scripps Howard newspaper that competes with a Gannett Corp. paper. "It certainly looks like it could lead to bidding wars." 
21/wsj_2182:One effect, syndicate executives say, is that some newspapers in competing markets are considering seeking long-term contracts for their favorite features instead of the usual pacts that let the syndicate cancel with 30 to 90 days' notice. 
21/wsj_2182:Industry executives say the columns and cartoons give newspapers consistency and build fierce reader loyalty. "I have people tell me that Garfield is the only reason they read the {Arkansas} Gazette," says Walter E. Hussman, the publisher of the competing Arkansas Democrat.
21/wsj_2182:In 1977, Universal pulled its features from the now-defunct Philadelphia Bulletin because of a contract dispute and because "there was no growth {there} for Universal," says John McMeel, president and co-owner of Universal. 
21/wsj_2182:But the main reason for the move, Mr. McMeel says, is a joint venture between Universal and A.H. Belo Corp., the Morning News's parent and the owner of five television stations.
21/wsj_2182:The Times Herald charges that the venture is a smokescreen, created to hide the News's plan to buy the features away. "We're very skeptical of a venture in which no one has invested a dollar, in which no one has any experience in syndicating animated features and game shows and for which there was not prior {market} research," says Roy E. Bode, the Times Herald's editor. 
21/wsj_2182:Willard Colston, chairman of the Los Angeles Times Syndicate and program director of the National Features Council, wanted the group to sponsor a panel discussion on the pact at its annual meeting in Dallas last week.
21/wsj_2182:Initially a majority of the directors, made up of syndicate executives, editors, cartoonists and columnists, supported the idea.
21/wsj_2182:A Houston state district judge refused to enjoin the syndicate from moving the features, and the Morning News began running most of them a few weeks ago.
21/wsj_2182:A trial on breach of contract and antitrust charges isn't expected for a few months.
21/wsj_2182:The Universal-Morning News deal also troubles syndicated writers and artists, who fear that they won't get their cut from this new type of exclusivity payment. (Creators of syndicated features generally receive about half the fee a newspaper pays for their work.) Mr. McMeel says some of the exclusivity payment fee will be used for future development of features and promises that those whose work appears in the Morning News will see "substantial immediate increases" in pay.
21/wsj_2182:"It's not something I'm considering; it'll become part of my boilerplate," he says. 
21/wsj_2183:Insurers are permitted to share some historical-claims data in order to enhance the competitiveness of small companies.
21/wsj_2183:Proposition 103 does not prohibit any use of territorial rating, but requires insurers to justify it scientifically.
21/wsj_2183:The most controversial provision of 103 requires a 20% rollback in all auto, home and business liability premiums to offset excessive rates -- the product of years of lax regulation and insulation from competition. 
21/wsj_2183:In fact, simply using the insurers own self-serving profitability standards, the California Insurance Commissioner -- an opponent of 103 -- has already called for more than $800 million in rollbacks.
21/wsj_2183:Hearings to begin this month will allow us to introduce evidence of the industry's inflated reserves, excess surplus, gross waste and inefficiency that will justify more than a 20% rollback. 
21/wsj_2184:The nine major domestic auto makers plan to build 10.4% fewer cars in this year's fourth quarter than they built a year ago, with the Big Three accounting for nearly all of the decline. 
21/wsj_2184:Some of the decline at the Big Three is production shifted to the "transplants": Diamond-Star Motors Corp. builds cars sold by Chrysler as well as Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Mazda Motor Corp. 's U.S. plant builds cars for its own and Ford dealers.
21/wsj_2184:The only transplants to drop below 1988 levels are owned by Mazda and Honda Motor Co. Part of the Mazda decline reflects "trying to anticipate what sales" are going to be, said a spokesman.
21/wsj_2184:The overall decline in car production is matched by an almost equal drop of 10.6% in expected truck output at GM, Ford, Chrysler and Nissan Motor Corp. Car and truck sales are expected to soften during the remainder of the year from unusually high, incentive-buoyed levels in August and September. 
21/wsj_2184:"None of it is a surprise," said Edward Sullivan, vice president of automotive consulting at the WEFA Group, a market analysis firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "Strong third-quarter sales stole from fourth-quarter sales." He said schedules at GM, in particular, are still too high given market expectations, which will likely mean some trimming.
21/wsj_2184:But "if the cuts are going to come, they'll have to come pretty soon," he added. "Once you get into November there's not a whole lot of flexibility." 
21/wsj_2184:Much of the difference in Chrysler's car output compared with a year ago comes from having two fewer plants; Chrysler's now-shuttered facilities in Kenosha, Wis., turned out 51,000 subcompacts and mid-size cars in the 1988 fourth-quarter before it closed in December. 
21/wsj_2184:More than half the decline in Ford's expected car output comes from closing its Escort plant in Wayne, Mich., as of Nov. 22 to prepare for production of the next generation of the popular subcompact.
21/wsj_2185:BRIDGEPORT, Conn. - Christopher Kimball, founder, president and publisher of Cook's magazine, said he is leaving the magazine by year end to launch a new men's consumer magazine. 
21/wsj_2185:The magazine is now published by Pennington Publishing, a subsidiary of Bonnier based in Bridgeport, Conn.
21/wsj_2186:The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 88.12-point bounce back from Friday's 190-point dive helped calm investor fears of a financial Armageddon.
21/wsj_2186:Treasury bill rates, which fell nearly three-quarters of a percentage point Friday as investors sought a safe haven from plunging stocks, jumped more than half a percentage point yesterday. 
21/wsj_2186:"Investors had expected the worst from the stock market, and so they piled into government bonds last Friday," said Steven Einhorn, chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Co. "But when we didn't get the worst, there was some movement out of bonds and back into stocks" yesterday.
21/wsj_2186:Speculation that the Federal Reserve stands ready to act as a safety net for the financial system helped restore investor confidence yesterday, said Mitchell Shivers, president of Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc.
21/wsj_2187:Despite turmoil created by a costly S&L bailout and the growing realization that a government guarantee may become a taxpayer liability, some members of Congress are insistent on using tax dollars as collateral for risky and unnecessary government-backed deals. 
21/wsj_2187:The FHA now holds a 50% share of the mortgage insurance market, while mismanagement prevails throughout the agency. 
21/wsj_2187:The General Accounting Office has just completed an FHA financial audit showing a loss of $4.2 billion for fiscal 1988.
21/wsj_2187:Congress should not consider any expansion of FHA until a comprehensive, proven plan for FHA solvency and reform is established. 
21/wsj_2187:Ignoring the FHA losses, a few of my colleagues have pushed for expansion of FHA mortgage guarantees by including wealthier home purchasers in the program.
21/wsj_2187:The National Affordable Housing Act (Cranston-D'Amato), introduced earlier this year, erases the current mortgage guarantee ceiling of $101,250 and places a "floating cap" at 95% of the median home price in higher-cost areas. 
21/wsj_2187:While it increases FHA loan-guarantee amounts, this bill also calls for the reduction of down-payment requirements.
21/wsj_2187:Legislation of this nature can be likened to fueling a runaway locomotive headed in the wrong direction. 
21/wsj_2187:Studies consistently show, and the GAO has admitted, that increasing loan-to-value ratios -- making higher loans without higher down-payment requirements -- increases the risk of default.
21/wsj_2187:Recently, a Senate Appropriations bill similarly removed the current FHA mortgage guarantee ceiling and increased it to 95% of the median home price in higher-cost areas.
21/wsj_2187:Out of concern for the potentially damaging effects of this proposal, and still awaiting the GAO report on FHA losses, I suggested the Senate instead work on ways to eliminate or substantially curtail this vast loan-guarantee expansion.
21/wsj_2187:After several hours of floor debate and three roll-call votes, we reached a compromise, placing the FHA loan-guarantee ceiling at $124,875.
21/wsj_2187:Although my desire to retain the present ceiling was exceeded by $23,625, a firm limit on loan guarantees did provide some consolation in the face of allowing a haphazard floating cap to remain in the bill. 
21/wsj_2187:Congress cannot expect taxpayers to continue bearing the burden of well-intended government guarantees. 
21/wsj_2187:It gave the appearance of a more stable financial industry.
21/wsj_2187:But postponing problems soon gave way to a nightmarish taxpayer bailout to the tune of over $200 billion. 
21/wsj_2187:The high-risk venture of unnecessarily expanding FHA mortgage guarantees without reform is ludicrous. 
21/wsj_2188:Or are they two manifestations of the one?
21/wsj_2188:But that gets too philosophical, and since there are no libraries in New York City either, who can solve the riddle of the two Sterbas? 
21/wsj_2188:University of Notre Dame 
21/wsj_2189:And while the U.S. currency recovered much of the lost ground from its collapse on Friday, several dealers contend that its potential to climb further could be limited. 
21/wsj_2189:In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the U.S. currency was changing hands at about 142.15 yen, up from Tokyo's Monday close of 140.74 yen, and at about 1.8665 marks, down a bit from late trading Monday in New York. 
21/wsj_2189:"Trading in dollar/mark looked like the Dow's shadow, to a point," said Jeffrey M. Mondschein, managing director in charge of foreign-exchange operations at Continental Bank in Chicago.
21/wsj_2189:"If you take away the stock-market brouhaha of the last few days, you still have lower {U.S.} interest rates, lower {U.S.} capacity utilization, and concern about quarterly earnings and general economic strength -- or lack thereof," said Mr. Mondschein, "so you wonder what the level of the dollar should be." 
21/wsj_2189:By the end of trading in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 1.8470 and 140.73 yen. 
21/wsj_2189:But the real fireworks began in European and early New York activity where traders were whipsawed by an inaccurate report of the stock market's opening and a statement by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
21/wsj_2189:Initially, Reuters reported that the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 4%, instead of the actual 0.7% decline.
21/wsj_2189:Roberto Bianchi, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland, described the market's mood as confused. "Everybody keeps repeating that it's OK, it's not the same as 1987, the central banks stand ready to stabilize the market, and yet there is a lot of uncertainty." 
21/wsj_2189:Mr. Bianchi said some big European institutional investors were selling dollars in lots of $100 million to $200 million. "Investors who had been in dollars for a long time got out.
21/wsj_2189:On a fundamental basis, I'm not afraid about the dollar, which runs more of a risk of being too strong than too weak," said Mr. Thieme.
21/wsj_2189:He also said that at about 3% of the total output of goods and services, the U.S. budget deficit is manageable. 
21/wsj_2189:Thus, with little risk of losing profits through a deteriorating currency, "what you have here is a unique buying opportunity," said Mr. Thieme of the U.S. stock market. 
21/wsj_2189:Nonetheless, Mr. Kuster added: "I don't trust the U.S. market that much" because of the dollar's volatility. "My clients lost a lot of money in the 1970s because of the dollar, so I can afford not to gain" from U.S. equities.
21/wsj_2190:In all the finger-pointing in the wake of Friday's stock-market plunge, you'd think the Transportation Department, of all agencies, would be safe. 
21/wsj_2190:His drumbeat of warnings on the perils of airline leveraged buy-outs, this theory goes, spooked major banks out of bankrolling the buy-out of UAL Inc.
21/wsj_2190:Mr. Skinner's LBO comments "probably helped discourage some of the banks from participating" in the UAL deal, says Louis Marckesano, airline analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., a Philadelphia brokerage house. "The government is putting its nose where it doesn't belong, and Skinner is at the head of the pack." 
21/wsj_2190:Many others -- indeed, most industry officials and members of Congress -- absolve Mr. Skinner, saying that the UAL deal was flawed from the start.
21/wsj_2190:But whether he single-handedly sparked the crash or had nothing to do with it, one thing is clear in the aftermath of the price slide: Sam Skinner, by his repeated jawboning on the buy-out issue, has irritated some in the Bush administration, so much so that some White House officials want to rein him in. 
21/wsj_2190:Moreover, administration officials say that Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Council of Economic Advisers Michael Boskin and U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills all have had problems with Mr. Skinner's jawboning. 
21/wsj_2190:Secretary Skinner, for his part, says "it's silly" to blame him for the market crash. "The banks in this country and in Japan couldn't put the financing together on the terms offered," he said in a telephone interview from Detroit, where he was speaking to the Economic Club of Detroit. "They have the same kind of questions that I raised about the financial aspects of the transaction." 
21/wsj_2190:At the very least, the administration has been sending mixed signals about leveraged buy-outs and foreign ownership of U.S. airlines.
21/wsj_2190:That gives Mr. Skinner lots of wiggle room, but critics say it doesn't provide a clear picture to the business community of what would pass government muster. 
21/wsj_2190:"It's a regulatory scandal," says Timothy Pettee, a Merrill Lynch & Co. airline analyst, who contends that the lack of clear standards raises the specter of inconsistent decision-making and unfair treatment. 
21/wsj_2190:The buy-out issue is politically and financially complex because of two separate but intertwining questions -- foreign ownership and debt levels.
21/wsj_2190:Under the original Northwest Airlines bid, KLM would have contributed 57% of the equity but received only 5% of the voting stock. 
21/wsj_2190:The Transportation Department concluded that was a violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of the law, and persuaded Northwest to restructure the deal.
21/wsj_2190:Among other things, the Economic Policy Council is discussing the department's interpretation of the law. 
21/wsj_2190:It appears that some leading administration officials believe the Northwest decision leaves the U.S. open to charges of protectionism and could undermine the U.S. position in international trade talks.
21/wsj_2190:Mr. Skinner plays down any rift in the administration on the foreign-ownership question. "I think that Darman, Brady, Boskin and I all have the same basic understanding of the importance of foreign investment in this country," he said yesterday. "And they all understand I have a statutory duty to enforce safety and existing law regarding foreign ownership." 
21/wsj_2190:But some experts say that there isn't a correlation between an airline's debt load and its safety record. "No systematic link between finances and safety has ever been demonstrated," says Michael Levine, dean of the Yale University School of Organization and Management and formerly a top official with the Civil Aeronautics Board. 
21/wsj_2190:Several members of Congress, generally delighted with Mr. Skinner's activist approach to buy-outs, want the department to be able to block the deals before they become final.
21/wsj_2190:Currently, however, the Transportation Department's authority over leveraged buy-outs appears to some to be a case of too much, too late.
21/wsj_2191:In a sign of its continuing problems in the U.S. auto market, General Motors Corp. acknowledged that a key midsized-car plant will shut down for two weeks to cut bulging inventories of Pontiac Grand Prix models. 
21/wsj_2191:At an Economic Club of Detroit luncheon, Mr. Smith said announcements last week that indicated at least three and perhaps five more GM plants in the U.S. and Canada may close by the early 1990s reflect "a carefully conceived, calculated and executed strategic plan." 
21/wsj_2191:Mr. Smith said GM is looking for ways to save some of the five older plants targeted last week. "I'm hoping we'll need another plant for the APV," a new plastic-bodied minivan now being assembled at a single plant in Tarrytown, N.Y., he said.
21/wsj_2191:However, Mr. Smith said that as a result of a $70 billion factory-modernization program undertaken over the last decade, "we can produce more in the new plants than we could in the old plants." 
21/wsj_2191:But GM is also struggling with a steep decline in U.S. car-market share that wasn't part of the company's strategic plans when it began the modernization program.
21/wsj_2191:The latest evidence of that is the decision to idle the Fairfax, Kan., plant that makes the Grand Prix less than three weeks into the new model year. 
21/wsj_2191:The Grand Prix is one of GM's newest lines of cars, the so-called GM-10 midsized cars.
21/wsj_2191:This fall, GM introduced the first four-door versions of the cars -- a move that was supposed to spur sales of the models, which have been disappointing so far. 
21/wsj_2191:But GM officials confirmed they will close the Fairfax plant for two weeks beginning Oct. 30 because of slow sales, bringing to 10 the number of weeks it will have been closed since early June.
21/wsj_2191:U.S. car dealers had a 92-day supply of the cars at the end of September, according to industry trade publication Wards Automotive Reports.
21/wsj_2191:Union officials at the Fairfax plant said the company is studying the feasibility of giving the plant another product to build, contrary to GM's original plan.
21/wsj_2192:The company said it had an 11% sales increase to $1.50 billion from $1.35 billion the year earlier. (The company's 1988 results don't include a non-recurring gain on the final settlement of the Redwood National Park condemnation in 1988's first quarter.) 
21/wsj_2192:The 1989 results include a gain of $3.5 million, or 29 cents a share, on the sale of a sawmill.
21/wsj_2192:For the nine months, the company posted profit of $33.8 million, or $2.86 a share, including the gain on the sawmill's sale.
21/wsj_2192:Looking ahead, Pope & Talbot said it expects all of 1989 to be a record year.
21/wsj_2193:Some nervous market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks lowered prices severely at the start of trading in response to Friday's sell-off.
21/wsj_2193:The markdowns were excessive, some traders groused, and indeed the market closed lower despite heavy buying of its leading technology stocks. 
21/wsj_2193:Many observers said yesterday afternoon that the price-slashing by some market makers during the last hour of trading Friday and before the market opened yesterday was overdone.
21/wsj_2193:The Dow Jones industrials rose 3.4%. "Bids were lowered too much," said Gary Rosenbach, a market maker and manager of equity trading at Needham & Co. 
21/wsj_2193:Yesterday, they again lowered their bids before trading began, in anticipation of another wave of selling.
21/wsj_2193:Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees trading on Nasdaq, said that between 9 a.m. and 9:30 a.m., the market's Small Order Execution System was deluged with six times the normal volume of quotation updates from market makers and had to be shut down for nearly 25 minutes after trading began so computers could digest the data. 
21/wsj_2193:He said total volume on the system, used for trades of 1,000 shares or less by non-professional investors, was 2.5 times busier than usual.
21/wsj_2193:They said it was reasonable to expect a rash of selling and to lower prices in anticipation of it. "Market makers saw sell orders first and that's why they (lowered bids)," said Brian Finnerty, a Shearson Lehman Hutton market maker. "The buyers sat back and didn't come in until a half hour or 45 minutes later." 
21/wsj_2193:E.E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld, a giant market-making firm, said, "Stocks looked ugly at 9:30.
21/wsj_2193:It was shades of October 1987 until it turned and stabilized at about 11:30.
21/wsj_2193:Some of the biggest stocks were snapped up by bargain hunters and fared much better.
21/wsj_2193:The result was that the Nasdaq 100 Index of the big non-financial issues rose 0.56, to 449.89.
21/wsj_2193:There was some favorable takeover news, in stark contrast to Friday, when nervousness about the future of leveraged buy-outs hurt takeover-related issues. 
21/wsj_2193:The company said the acquisition, valued at about $31.3 million, is subject to the condition that at least two-thirds of the Skipper's shares outstanding are tendered. 
21/wsj_2193:The stock rose after Grayhound said it agreed to enter into a five-year joint venture with Lermer Corp., a maker of airline-interior equipment. 
21/wsj_2194:According to people who attended, he didn't advocate an end to glasnost, his policy of openness.
21/wsj_2194:But he made clear that the press should show greater responsibility in its reporting and cut back on criticism of his reforms. 
21/wsj_2194:The text of his remarks hasn't been published, and editors say they have no instructions as to whether it will be.
21/wsj_2194:Accounts of previous such meetings with media and other groups have been printed, sometimes after a delay of several days. 
21/wsj_2194:According to participants at the meeting and Soviet journalists who were later briefed by their editors, Mr. Gorbachev blamed the press for fueling a nationwide mood of despondency.
21/wsj_2194:In particular, he complained about some articles this summer that openly discussed the possibility of a coup or civil war in the Soviet Union, and accused the media of fueling panic buying of goods by printing stories about impending shortages. 
21/wsj_2194:He singled out the daily Izvestia and the weekly Argumenty i Fakty, and also gave stinging criticism of Yuri Afanasyev, a leading reformist historian who has written articles attacking the Communist Party.
21/wsj_2194:The meeting lasted a little under two hours and was attended by most members of the ruling Politburo.
21/wsj_2194:According to participants, Mr. Gorbachev was particularly incensed by an article on the front page of Argumenty i Fakty this month that examined the popularity of members of the Soviet Parliament.
21/wsj_2194:The piece was based on a survey of 1,500 readers' letters and contained some criticism of Mr. Gorbachev himself. 
21/wsj_2194:It said many thanked the Soviet leader for his "self-control, modesty, culture and ability to hear a speaker out." But others criticized him, "for imposing his opinion on other deputies, giving commentaries to many speeches, holding elections with no choice of candidate, putting pressure on the voting process and maneuvering between the right and left wings" of the Parliament.
21/wsj_2194:It attacked the level of a debate on the private-sector cooperative movement, saying "the discussion was more like a riot than a civilized exchange of points of view." And it questioned the speed with which the Parliament was adopting new legislation, often with a minimum of debate. 
21/wsj_2194:The Parliament yesterday approved legislation that imposes new restrictions on the cooperative movement, enabling local authorities to set ceilings for prices and preventing the "speculative" sale of goods in short supply for prices higher than that charged by the state. 
21/wsj_2195:Damon Darlin is a fine reporter of serious topics.
21/wsj_2195:Your "Tee Hee" treatment of the dramatically improved life style that the Koreans have forged, particularly in the past 10 years, is insulting to the strong bonds between our two nations. 
21/wsj_2195:Non-"Saturday Night Live" journalists might have analyzed that embedded in the commercial hype of the "Tae Porum" gift-giving season is an immense compliment to American assistance to Korea.
21/wsj_2195:Some of us, who were personal or official participants in the days when the U.S. was able to supply needed material and morale boosts to a destitute nation, now rejoice that the better life we thought possible for Korea has come to fruition. 
21/wsj_2195:If we and the Koreans gaze at the same full harvest moon during "Tae Porum" today, which side has uneasy visions of future bitter harvests? 
21/wsj_2196:James T. Boone was named to the new position of chief administrative officer, becoming second in command at this bank holding company.
21/wsj_2196:Mr. Boone had been president and chief executive officer of Sunburst Bank, Louisiana, one of the company's two banks.
21/wsj_2197:Robert D. Paster, 49 years old, vice president and Space Shuttle Main Engine program manager, was named president of the Rocketdyne division of this aerospace concern, succeeding Richard Schwartz, who resigned to become president of Hercules Aerospace Co., Wilmington, Del. 
21/wsj_2198:Wall Street's takeover-stock speculators yesterday suffered their worst bloodbath since the Black Monday crash of October 1987. 
21/wsj_2198:Nearly all of the big paper losses were caused by declines of more than 20% in two airline stocks, UAL Corp. and AMR Corp. Wall Street's arbitrage desks had loaded up on stocks of both companies after each had received takeover proposals from investors.
21/wsj_2198:The bid for UAL came from Marvis Davis of Beverly Hills, Calif., and the bid for AMR came from Donald Trump of New York. 
21/wsj_2198:But in the wake of Friday's announcement that a UAL management-union group couldn't obtain bank financing for its agreement to buy UAL at $300 a share, UAL stock plunged $56.875 yesterday to close at $222.875 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading of nearly 2.3 million shares.
21/wsj_2198:That was bad enough for the arbs. "On balance, the Street's biggest position has been UAL, mostly {bought} in the $280 range," said Frank Gallagher, director of Phoenix Capital Markets, who follows arbitrage activity. 
21/wsj_2198:But the arbs were quickly hit with another dose of bad news when Mr. Trump announced that he was withdrawing his proposal to buy AMR at $120 a share.
21/wsj_2198:After trading in AMR resumed, the stock fell sharply to close at $76.50 a share, down $22.125 on the day in Big Board composite trading of more than 4.7 million shares. 
21/wsj_2198:Mr. Gallagher estimates that arbitragers owned the equivalent of nearly 30% of UAL's stock, or about six million shares, indicating losses of about $350 million.
21/wsj_2198:He estimates that arbs own the equivalent of about 10% of AMR's stock, also about six million shares, indicating an additional $130 million in losses. 
21/wsj_2198:Many takeover stocks rebounded somewhat yeterday, but none made up all of their sharp declines on Friday. 
21/wsj_2198:Despite the losses, there haven't been any reports of arbitrage or brokerage firms that have encountered serious financial difficulties.
21/wsj_2198:Several traders said they weren't selling UAL shares because they believe the buy-out group will be able to obtain financing to complete the acquisition eventually, although perhaps at a price of less than $300 a share. 
21/wsj_2198:Mr. Gallagher thinks that much of the heavy trading in UAL shares was "one arb passing it on to another.
21/wsj_2198:Hilton is soliciting bids for some or all of its hotel and casino operations; Warner is being acquired by Time Warner Inc., which already owns about 58% of Warner. 
21/wsj_2198:In October 1987, however, stocks of some potential takeover targets, such as Dayton Hudson Corp., fell about 50%, Mr. Gallagher said. 
21/wsj_2198:A trader at one major Wall Street firm said his arbitrage desk had about 30% of its capital currently invested in cash.
21/wsj_2198:Two years ago, he said, his firm had borrowed an amount equal to about 30% of its capital so that it could buy more stocks.
21/wsj_2198:Mr. Gallagher said he believes that situation is typical of the more conservative strategies that many arbitragers adopted after the crash. 
21/wsj_2198:When traders borrow money to buy additional amounts of stock, they run the risk of having to sell stocks after a sharp price decline such as yesterday's to meet margin calls.
21/wsj_2198:Margin calls are demands by lenders that traders put up more cash to make up for declines in the value of stocks that serve as collateral for loans. 
21/wsj_2198:One trader, however, said he believes that most of the selling in takeover-related stocks in the past two trading days has been the result of judgments by traders that takeover bids are less likely to be completed, rather than selling prompted by margin calls. 
21/wsj_2199:In response to your extracts from David Fenton's memo ("How a PR Firm Executed the Alar Scare," editorial page, Oct. 3): For the past 10 years, the Environmental Protection Agency has known about the carcinogenic hazards of Alar, and has carried on proceedings to remove the chemical from the market.
21/wsj_2199:Yet until recently, no significant progress had occurred because the pesticide manufacturers and other special interests have blocked necessary congressional reform, stymied EPA actions to cancel Alar and other hazardous pesticides, and kept the public in the dark about the threat of pesticides. 
21/wsj_2199:In this country, major reforms occur only when substantial public pressure is applied to the government and Congress in order to counteract the lockhold of special interests.
21/wsj_2199:To move the pesticide-reform agenda, NRDC -- like any major corporation or the government -- used the professional communication skills of a public-relations firm to educate the public about the results of our two-year-long scientific study on pesticides residues in children's food. 
21/wsj_2199:NRDC offers no apologies for making public the results of our report on pesticides in the diet of preschoolers.
21/wsj_2199:We will continue to present the facts about pesticides in food to the broadest possible segment of society. 
21/wsj_2199:Until the food supply is safe, especially for children, NRDC will keep doing everything we can to educate the public about the unnecessary and intolerable risk of pesticides. 
21/wsj_2199:Mr. Fenton's PR firm has abused the trust of the media and done the public no favor.
21/wsj_2199:I was fascinated to read political publicist David Fenton's self-serving celebration of his own work in creating the illusion that Alar was "an intolerable risk" to Americans -- particularly American children -- when used on apples. (The one "fact" that caught my eye -- the alleged $700,000 paid by the apple growers to Hill & Knowlton -- was overstated by more than a factor of two.) 
21/wsj_2199:While I doubt the media were as gullible and malleable as Mr. Fenton's memo suggests, the Alar scare was created, mostly out of thin air, just as Mr. Fenton claims, and the media that were taken in can learn something from this episode.
21/wsj_2199:So, for that matter, can other industries subject to this kind of guerrilla PR attack. 
21/wsj_2199:Mr. Fenton says it was not the intent of the NRDC to have school systems ban apples.
21/wsj_2199:Am I also to believe that Meryl Streep did not intend to harm apple growers by condemning the use of Alar?
22/wsj_2200:Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital, creating another potential obstacle to the government's sale of sick thrifts. 
22/wsj_2200:But the RTC also requires "working" capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold, until the assets can be sold separately.
22/wsj_2200:"It's a problem that clearly has to be resolved," said David Cooke, executive director of the RTC.
22/wsj_2200:Moreover, it says the RTC's total obligations may not exceed $50 billion, but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt, and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds. 
22/wsj_2200:But Congress didn't anticipate or intend more public debt, say opponents of the RTC's working-capital plan, and Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed. 
22/wsj_2200:"That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means, which seems to me sort of draconian," he said. "The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility." 
22/wsj_2201:Hard on the heels of Friday's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that's followed, a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message: Keep on investing, the market's just fine.
22/wsj_2201:Fidelity, for example, prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge.
22/wsj_2201:When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon, the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers.
22/wsj_2201:A Fidelity spokesman says the 800-line, which already was operating but which many clients didn't know about, received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend. "A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us," he says. "To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial.
22/wsj_2201:We had to think about it ahead of time." 
22/wsj_2201:Underneath the headline "Diversification," it counsels, "Based on the events of the past week, all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market's volatility." It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name. 
22/wsj_2201:In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle, the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house, ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night.
22/wsj_2201:The new PaineWebber commercial, created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co., features Mary Farrell, one of the firm's most visible investment strategists, sounding particularly bullish.
22/wsj_2201:"We're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything, which just drives the prices down further," says John Lampe, PaineWebber's director of advertising. "If you owned it and liked it Friday, the true value hasn't changed." He adds, "This isn't 1987 revisited." 
22/wsj_2201:The plan had been to make one of Shearson's easy-to-film, black-and-white "Where We Stand" commercials, which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985.
22/wsj_2201:The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow, replacing the debut commercial of Shearson's new ad campaign, "Leadership by Example." 
22/wsj_2201:The market seems to be straightening out; we're taking a wait-and-see attitude," says Cathleen B. Stewart, executive vice president of marketing. 
22/wsj_2201:In any case, the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987.
22/wsj_2201:In 1987, despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms, individuals ran from the market en masse.
22/wsj_2201:ARNOLD ADVERTISING: Edward Eskandarian, former chairman of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS/Boston, reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in Arnold Advertising, a small Boston shop.
22/wsj_2201:Mr. Eskandarian, who resigned his Della Femina post in September, becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold.
22/wsj_2201:John Verret, the agency's president and chief executive, will retain the title of president.
22/wsj_2201:The magazine will distribute 10% of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers. 
22/wsj_2202:You know what the law of averages is, don't you?
22/wsj_2202:Baseball, that game of the long haul, is the quintessential sport of the mean, and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend.
22/wsj_2202:Morever, much of the damage was accomplished by A's who had some catching up to do. 
22/wsj_2202:In game two, on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn, a lot of the catching up was done by the A's catcher, Terry Steinbach.
22/wsj_2202:So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games, and batted in the seventh position of the A's lineup. "If you get your pitch, and take a good swing, anything can happen," he later remarked. 
22/wsj_2202:On Saturday night, quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and, no doubt, future droughts.
22/wsj_2202:The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9, a.k.a. the "bottom of the order," got seven of their team's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision. 
22/wsj_2202:Right-hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger.
22/wsj_2202:He's an ex-hurler who's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery, which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat. 
22/wsj_2202:The upshot of the downshoot is that the A's go into San Francisco's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest.
22/wsj_2202:The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs (29 of 39) that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all.
22/wsj_2202:One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART (that's a better name for a public conveyance than "Desire," don't you think?) would have been ecstatic over the proceedings, but they observe them in relative calm.
22/wsj_2202:Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum, and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition, hostilities advanced no further, at least as far as I could see. 
22/wsj_2202:A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams. "I'm for the Giants today, but only because they lost yesterday.
22/wsj_2202:The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility.
22/wsj_2202:Anyway, the A's gave you a lot of heroes to root for.
22/wsj_2202:In the opening game, besides Steinbach and Stewart, there was Walt Weiss, a twiggy-looking, second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery.
22/wsj_2202:An A's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson, who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation.
22/wsj_2202:It's that last set of numbers, as much as anything else, that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come. "I believe in the law of averages," declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two. "I'd rather see a so-so hitter who's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who's cold." 
22/wsj_2203:The computer maker, which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S., also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will "adversely affect" its fourth-quarter performance and "make it difficult" to better 1988 results. 
22/wsj_2203:NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas, reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets.
22/wsj_2203:Analysts estimate those gains at 12% to 13%, a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR's major customers. 
22/wsj_2203:In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry, NCR, which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers, is also affected by the retail and financial sectors, "areas of the economy that have generally not been robust," notes Sanjiv G. Hingorani, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. 
22/wsj_2203:In the year-earlier fourth quarter, NCR had profit of $149.6 million, or $1.85 a share, on revenue of $1.8 billion. 
22/wsj_2203:Last year, NCR had net income of $439.3 million, or $5.33 a share, on $5.99 billion in revenue. 
22/wsj_2204:Concerning your Sept. 19 article "Wall Street Firms Link Analysts' Pay to Performance," I'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard, cold facts of the real working world.
22/wsj_2204:That should stop a lot of account-churning, and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern, careful thought and good sense.
22/wsj_2205:At Jefferies & Co., J. Francis Palamara didn't reach the office until 5:30 a.m., but then he had been up most of the night at home. "I had calls all night long from the States," he said. "I was woken up every hour -- 1:30, 2:30, 3:30, 4:30.
22/wsj_2205:For many of London's securities traders, it was a day that started nervously in the small hours.
22/wsj_2205:But as the day ended in a frantic Wall Street-inspired rally, the City breathed a sigh of relief. 
22/wsj_2205:So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London's financial district.
22/wsj_2205:In the wake of Wall Street's plunge last Friday, the London market was considered especially vulnerable.
22/wsj_2205:And before the opening of trading here yesterday, all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be. 
22/wsj_2205:At Jefferies' trading room on Finsbury Circus, a stately circle at the edge of the financial district, desktop computer screens displayed the London market's major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index.
22/wsj_2205:The Jefferies office, a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm, played it conservatively, seeking to avoid risk. "This is not the sort of market to have a big position in," said David Smith, who heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks. "We tend to run a very tight book." Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers, and there weren't many buyers. 
22/wsj_2205:He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers' price quotes.
22/wsj_2205:By this time, it was 4:30 a.m. in New York, and Mr. Smith fielded a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market, which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday's New York market break. 
22/wsj_2205:"Fundamentally dangerous. . . ," Mr. Smith said, almost in a whisper, ". . . .fundamentally weak . . . fairly vulnerable still . . . extremely dangerously poised . . . we're in for a lot of turbulence. . . ." 
22/wsj_2205:In the center of the trading floor, chief trader Roger Streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes.
22/wsj_2205:As the London market rallied, some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it.
22/wsj_2206:Ambassador Paul Nitze's statement (Notable & Quotable, Sept. 20), "If you have a million people working for you, every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year," is a pretty negative way of looking at things. 
22/wsj_2206:Isn't it just as fair to say that if you have a million people working for you, every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year? 
22/wsj_2207:The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines. 
22/wsj_2207:The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, spurred quick action on the legislation, introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday.
22/wsj_2207:The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump, who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines.
22/wsj_2207:In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar (D., Minn.), Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR, and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal. 
22/wsj_2207:Aides both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR isn't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation. "It's still on the fast track and we still want to do it," said one Senate aide. 
22/wsj_2207:Currently, the transportation secretary doesn't have clearly established authority to block mergers, but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit.
22/wsj_2207:Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process, and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry. 
22/wsj_2207:In general, the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15% or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired.
22/wsj_2207:It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition. 
22/wsj_2207:The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information hasn't been provided, or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially, result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets, or give control to a foreign interest.
22/wsj_2207:All the witnesses, both congressmen and industry experts, expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe, cost-effective service.
22/wsj_2207:But several committee members disapproved, some backing Mr. Trump's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge. 
22/wsj_2207:One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin-off companies. 
22/wsj_2208:In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members, a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow. 
22/wsj_2208:"It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one," said Doug Hammond, the mediator, who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations. "We're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that, we have made no expression of expectations," a Boeing spokesman said. 
22/wsj_2208:The Machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a 10% wage increase over the life of the pact, plus some bonuses.
22/wsj_2208:Now in its 13th day, the strike has idled about 55,000 machinists and has started to delay delivery of some jetliners. 
22/wsj_2208:With a strike fund of about $100 million, the union had said it was prepared for a long strike.
22/wsj_2208:And at the company's Wichita, Kan., plant, about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working, Boeing said.
22/wsj_2209:As part of the plan, Dataproducts announced a pact to sell $63 million of its real estate holdings to Trizec Properties Inc., a unit of Canada's Trizec Corp. 
22/wsj_2210:The Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which closed before the New York exchanges opened, was the hardest hit of the major European markets, with the DAX Index dropping 12.8%. 
22/wsj_2210:The economy of West Germany and the EC {European Community} is highly stable." 
22/wsj_2210:Paris, which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks, also was hard hit.
22/wsj_2210:Following is a breakdown of major market activity: 
22/wsj_2210:FRANKFURT: One of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of Europe's strongest economy.
22/wsj_2210:The DAX Index of 30 West German blue chips plunged 12.8%, a one-day record, wiping out the summer's gains.
22/wsj_2210:Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday's U.S. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the Frankfurt exchange's losing 35% of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake. 
22/wsj_2210:After the opening was delayed 30 minutes because of the crush of sell orders, Frankfurt's normal two-hour trading session was extended 75 minutes to handle the heavy volume. "The beginning was chaotic," said Nigel Longley, a broker for Commerzbank AG. "It took three-quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market." 
22/wsj_2210:Institutional investors and bankers, many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets, were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8% decline in Tokyo stock prices. "Everybody was still confident, including most institutional investors.
22/wsj_2210:That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors," said Norbert Braeuer, a senior trader for Hessische Landesbank. 
22/wsj_2210:But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize, analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the Frankfurt exchange, which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a 1989 high of 1657.61 on Sept. 8. 
22/wsj_2210:Some of West Germany's bluest chips took some of the biggest hits.
22/wsj_2210:LONDON: Headed toward a record drop at midday, the London stock market recouped two-thirds of its losses in the wake of New York's early rally. 
22/wsj_2210:The CAC General Index ended down 5.4% at 523.6, a drop of 29.6 points from Friday. 
22/wsj_2211:The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves. 
22/wsj_2211:Morgan received $2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans; had they been accruing interest, net interest income would have been $35 million higher in the quarter, Morgan said.
22/wsj_2211:Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as non-accruing, costing the bank $10 million of interest income in the third period. 
22/wsj_2211:Income from sources other than interest climbed 12% to $414 million, reflecting higher corporate-finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities. "These increases were partly offset by lower trading-related" income, the bank said.
22/wsj_2211:NCNB Corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period, largely because of continued strong performance by the bank's Texas operations. 
22/wsj_2211:The latest quarter included a gain of $56.1 million, or 59 cents a share, related to the purchase of the remaining 51% of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
22/wsj_2211:The strong performance, however, contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of NCNB's problem loans, particularly in the Southeast.
22/wsj_2211:In the third quarter, nonperforming assets jumped to $474.1 million, or 1.43% of net loans and leases, from $232.8 million, or 1.13% in the second quarter.
22/wsj_2211:The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17% in NCNB's Southeast operations, as well as a 28% growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign.
22/wsj_2211:NCNB Texas National, formed from the remnants of of the failed First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, contributed $76.9 million to NCNB's bottom line in the third quarter.
22/wsj_2211:NCNB said its third-quarter results reflect 100% of earnings of the Texas operation since Aug. 1. 
22/wsj_2211:Last week, the banking company said it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association, Tampa, Fla., and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio, Texas, for $169.4 million. 
22/wsj_2211:Security Pacific's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter, but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10% increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans. 
22/wsj_2211:Non-interest income fell 6% in the quarter, mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations.
22/wsj_2212:LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it won't take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to buy LIN and has asked for clarification of the offer. 
22/wsj_2212:The new offer, which seeks 50.3% of the cellular and broadcasting concern, is for $125 a share for 22 million LIN shares.
22/wsj_2212:McCaw's revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN. 
22/wsj_2212:McCaw has "no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain," the LIN board said.
22/wsj_2213:A group of institutional investors in Telerate Inc. said that Dow Jones & Co. 's $18-a-share offer for the electronic financial information services company is "grossly inadequate." 
22/wsj_2213:In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group, which holds about 4.5 million Telerate shares, or about 4.7% of the shares outstanding, said " . . . at present none of us believes an offer for less than $25 per share would be fair and some believe that $25 is too low." The letter was dated Oct. 6. 
22/wsj_2213:Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has launched an $18-a-share, or $576 million, tender offer to acquire the remaining Telerate shares outstanding; Dow Jones owns 67% of Telerate.
22/wsj_2213:Among other issues, the group's letter said it has "concerns as to whether Dow Jones's offer meets the applicable requirements of procedural fairness." 
22/wsj_2214:U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the first dispute-settlement panel set up under the U.S.-Canadian "free trade" agreement has ruled that Canada's restrictions on exports of Pacific salmon and herring violate the accord. 
22/wsj_2214:However, in Ottawa, Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the dispute-settlement panel accepted the "legitimacy of Canada's position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries." 
22/wsj_2214:Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the U.S. and Canadian government views of the panel's report, an aide for Mrs. Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions "are illegal." 
22/wsj_2214:Earlier, an international panel set up under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian fish-export restrictions violated GATT rules. 
22/wsj_2216:The plan would permit the bank holding company to retire its bank and debenture obligations through exchanges of cash and equity. 
22/wsj_2216:The FDIC, which in 1986 provided $130 million in open-bank assistance to BancOklahoma's Bank of Oklahoma, Tulsa, unit will continue to maintain $90 million in preferred stock in the Tulsa bank unit.
22/wsj_2216:In exchange for the other $40 million, the FDIC will receive additional warrants entitling it to buy 60% of BancOklahoma's common stock outstanding, up from the 55% option the FDIC received under terms of the 1986 capital infusion. 
22/wsj_2216:In exchange for the $76 million they are owed, creditor banks will receive 3.9 million shares of BancOklahoma common stock and the proceeds from the future sales of four subsidiary banks to private buyers, the bank holding company said. 
22/wsj_2216:Also under the agreement, debenture holders will get one million shares of common stock in exchange for $7.7 million in debentures and holders of BancOklahoma's series A preferred stock will receive 1.25 shares of common stock for every share of preferred they own, the company said. 
22/wsj_2217:Bear Stearns's chief economist, Lawrence Kudlow, in the Sept. 29 issue of the firm's Global Spectator: 
22/wsj_2217:Were it true that a weak currency paves the way for trade surpluses, then presumably Argentina would be the center of today's global economy. 
22/wsj_2218:BSN Corp. said it will begin an offer tomorrow to exchange up to one million of its common shares and all of its $16.6 million in 7 3/4% convertible debentures due 2001 for a package of new debt and common stock warrants. 
22/wsj_2218:Under terms of the offer, the sporting goods maker will swap $9 face amount of 9 1/4% subordinated notes due 1996 and one warrant for each common share.
22/wsj_2218:BSN also is offering $850 face amount of new notes and 64 common-stock warrants for each $1,000 face amount of its convertible debt outstanding. 
22/wsj_2218:The offer isn't contingent on a certain amount of debt or stock being exchanged. 
22/wsj_2218:If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer, BSN will increase its debt by $9 million, but it also will recognize a $2 million gain from retiring the old debt, said Michael J. Blumenfeld, president. "We have sufficient cash flow to handle that," he said. 
22/wsj_2219:The firm's drop in net reflected weaker revenue in transactions for its own account -- a decline of 19% to $314.6 million on reduced revenue from trading fixed-income securities.
22/wsj_2219:Merrill Lynch's commission revenue grew 21%, however, to $462.8 million, on higher share prices and volume and on strong sales of mutual funds.
22/wsj_2219:The brokerage also reported a loss of $2.2 million from the discontinued operations and disposal of its Fine Homes International Limited Partnership real-estate subsidiary. 
22/wsj_2219:Separately, PaineWebber posted net income for the third quarter of $16.8 million, or 41 cents a share, reflecting a "broad-based improvement" in the company's core businesses.
22/wsj_2219:A year ago, net at the New York investment banking firm was $20.9 million, or 50 cents a share, including a special pretax gain of $46.3 million from the sale of the company's interest in National Car Rental Systems Inc. Revenue was $444.9 million, including net interest, down slightly from $450.7 million. 
22/wsj_2220:Purchase of the 76-story structure is subject to execution of a definitive agreement, approval by the boards of Seafirst and its parent company BankAmerica Corp., and approval by regulators. 
22/wsj_2221:Individual investors, investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive; those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans.
22/wsj_2221:But several large banks said yesterday they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties. 
22/wsj_2221:"We're seeing nothing out of the ordinary," said one official at a Top 10 bank. "That's good news, because we all swim in this water." Added another executive at a big bank: "We were all a little goosey over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen {Monday}, but it's been very quiet.
22/wsj_2222:No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling.
22/wsj_2222:The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies, calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels. 
22/wsj_2222:A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself.
22/wsj_2222:What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds.
22/wsj_2222:Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them.
22/wsj_2222:The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies.
22/wsj_2222:Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (which, with the SEC, regulates the Chicago stock-index markets) be unable to agree, the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary. 
22/wsj_2222:The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day.
22/wsj_2222:Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers, and specialists -- who I believe should stay, despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions. (Of course, specialists' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices.
22/wsj_2222:Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders.) But the task of improving market performance remains unfinished. 
22/wsj_2222:Mr. Freund, former chief economist of the New York Stock Exchange, is a professor of economics at Pace University's business school in New York. 
22/wsj_2223:The "social dimension" -- worker concerns -- of the European Community's plan to open its internal borders in 1992 could set the effort "off the rails" if not done reasonably, says General Electric senior vice president Frank Doyle.
22/wsj_2223:The judge dismissed the fan's suit against the team, however, ruling the Orioles innocent of negligent hiring, and not responsible for a fight that was outside the players' employment. 
22/wsj_2223:PROPOSALS ARISE for coping with the shortage of nurses. 
22/wsj_2223:An Association of Academic Health Centers report urges freeing nurses from duties that don't require special skills.
22/wsj_2223:Over a third of 618 hospitals surveyed by consultant Hewitt Associates use a "clinical ladder," basing advancement on performance and education.
22/wsj_2223:TREATING EMPLOYEES with respect is crucial for managers, says consultant Hay Group after surveys of a million workers.
22/wsj_2223:It's in their top five "work values." Fully 80% of employees who say their bosses treat them with respect, but only a third of those who don't feel respected say they're satisfied with where they work. 
22/wsj_2223:SPRUCING UP THE DIGS: About 200 employees of the Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development for four months painted walls, polished and carpeted floors, bought plants, cleaned windows and blinds, and hung pictures at the agency's Baltimore office.
22/wsj_2223:The 3,000 hours of work will save the state $55,000. 
22/wsj_2223:CURBING WAGE BOOSTS will get high priority again in 1990 collective bargaining, a Bureau of National Affairs survey of 250 companies with pacts expiring next year indicates.
22/wsj_2223:Despite labor-shortage warnings, 80% aim for first-year wage increases of under 4%; and 77% say they'd try to replace workers, if struck, or would consider it. 
22/wsj_2223:TEMPORARY WORKERS have good educations, the National Association of Temporary Services says; its survey of 2,508 such employees shows 82% with more than a high-school education, and 31% with college degrees.
22/wsj_2223:A third of 439 companies surveyed by the Employee Relocation Council report a rise in 1988 sales losses over 1987.
22/wsj_2223:RJR Nabisco pays up to $30,000 of losses, including improvements.
22/wsj_2223:Since 1984, firms offering prepurchase house appraisals, to deter overpaying, rose to 40% of those the council polled, from 28%. 
22/wsj_2223:THE CHECKOFF: The National Academy of Engineering gives two inventors of the semiconductor microchip a $350,000 achievement award. . . . Now, that's reactionary: Letter Carriers union president Vincent Sombrotto accuses Philadelphia postmaster Charles James of "12th century . . . oppressive management tactics." 
22/wsj_2224:Yesterday was, in the words of New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan Jr., just your "reasonably normal, 400 million-share, up 88-points day." 
22/wsj_2224:The so-called circuit breakers devised by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to quell free falls in stock and futures prices weren't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day. 
22/wsj_2224:Of greater help, the Big Board chairman said, was the "natural circuit breaker" of the weekend, that provided a breathing period that "brought rationality back to the market." 
22/wsj_2225:By Loss of Customers 
22/wsj_2225:Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery-store convenience food, home-delivered pizza and other takeout fare, says a spokesman for the report, a publication of NPD Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y. 
22/wsj_2225:The loss of more customers is the latest in a string of problems.
22/wsj_2225:Chicken chains also are feeling more pressure from McDonald's Corp., which introduced its McChicken sandwich this year and recently tested the sale of individual pieces of chicken. 
22/wsj_2225:New management at Kentucky Fried Chicken, a unit of PepsiCo Inc., has fought back with new medium and large chicken sandwiches for the lunch crowd.
22/wsj_2225:Kentucky Fried Chicken also is testing home-delivery of chicken, which could be a hit with stay-at-home diners.
22/wsj_2225:The only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot. 
22/wsj_2225:The messages resemble the Business Traveler, a daily dose of travel tips developed by Mr. Bear and sponsored by travel agencies in several major cities. 
22/wsj_2225:But such spots can be too soft. "There's always a risk of lost messages," says John Fitzgerald, chairman of Ketchum Advertising USA, which created similar radio spots for Pittsburgh National Bank. "It's a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition." 
22/wsj_2225:But the chain is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements.
22/wsj_2225:That doesn't thrill Procter & Gamble Co., maker of Cascade dishwasher detergent.
22/wsj_2225:A company spokesman questioned the validity of the list, noting that chlorine is present in all major dishwasher detergents.
22/wsj_2225:A study by Safeway's Scanner Marketing Research shows soap sales climbed 5% when bars were neatly stacked on shelves instead of dumped in a wire basket. . . . Which celebrity endorsers are most believable?
22/wsj_2226:If she is nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate, Dr. Novello would succeed C. Everett Koop, who rattled liberals and conservatives alike with his outspoken views on a range of health issues. 
22/wsj_2226:Dr. Novello, an expert on pediatric kidney diseases, is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
22/wsj_2226:The newsletter Medicine & Health, which first disclosed her selection by Dr. Sullivan, said she is 44 years old and she studied at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine. 
22/wsj_2227:The continuing series of HUD scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork-barrel politics.
22/wsj_2227:Nevertheless, lobbies such as the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special-interest spending. 
22/wsj_2227:Kent Colton, NAHB executive vice president, argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers, increased homelessness, and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be "very difficult" to solve "without expanded federal resources." 
22/wsj_2227:But the NAHB was created in 1943 out of an organization that made its name fighting a Roosevelt administration proposal to take over all defense housing production.
22/wsj_2227:Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer's coalition, pushing for such initiatives as the balanced-budget amendment.
22/wsj_2227:But NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs.
22/wsj_2227:The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish-list, which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $15 billion annually. 
22/wsj_2227:It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95% of the median price in a particular market, instead of limiting it to $101,250; reduce (or even eliminate) FHA down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program; provide "adequate" funding for the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA); increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing, including $4 billion in block grants to states and localities; and "fully fund" the McKinney Act, a $656 million potpourri for the homeless. 
22/wsj_2227:Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past, and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists, as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal, or congressmen.
22/wsj_2227:Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in "no cost to the government," the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing (such as low-income) to the single-family home market would result in a major expense.
22/wsj_2227:All told, the federal government already guarantees more than $900 billion of mortgages. 
22/wsj_2227:In its nicely produced publication "Where Will Our Children Live?" the NAHB does acknowledge that "of course, the full measure of housing affordability cannot be provided by the federal government." It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation, particularly zoning and building fees, which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people.
22/wsj_2227:The association, a majority of whose 156,000 members build fewer than 25 units a year, is like many other business lobbies.
22/wsj_2227:Explains Sheila MacDonald of the National Taxpayers Union: "It treads in two worlds.
22/wsj_2227:The builders like the subsidies, but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues, such as the balanced-budget amendment." Unfortunately, the organization's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility.
22/wsj_2227:Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $19 billion omnibus housing bill, the organization "basically dropped out of the taxpayers' coalition," says Ms. MacDonald.
22/wsj_2227:As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges: "Government is not going to solve the problem. . . . The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down." More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies.
22/wsj_2228:In an attempt to give new momentum to European Community plans for a single currency, EC government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the EC's founding Treaty of Rome. 
22/wsj_2228:According to diplomatic sources in Brussels, most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990, and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in Strasbourg, France, on Dec. 8 and 9. 
22/wsj_2228:But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference doesn't require unanimity. 
22/wsj_2228:French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June, but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
22/wsj_2229:The latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke T. Boone Pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade.
22/wsj_2229:When asked "What went wrong?" the unfortunate victim replied, "It was a combination of things." And so it was on Gray Friday. 
22/wsj_2229:The grand marshal of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage.
22/wsj_2229:Even if that is so, however, it's probably the case that no barriers should have been erected to stop the procession before the end of the rout(e). 
22/wsj_2229:Although the union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer, consisting of less cash, the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending. 
22/wsj_2229:Lots of other entries made up the parade, of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices, signalling Federal Reserve tightness; and the Bush administration's (temporary?) defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax.
22/wsj_2229:As usual, few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching band of program traders, although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write. 
22/wsj_2229:What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street, however, was the sudden concern that, whatever the reason, the pool of debt capital is drying up.
22/wsj_2229:Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers, rather than the small investor, as their highly margined investments in the "deal" stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing. 
22/wsj_2229:The multibillion-dollar prospects, where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and/or issue billions in high-yield debt, were where the damage was concentrated. 
22/wsj_2229:The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers, such as Resorts International, Integrated Resources, and Campeau's retailing empire, have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities.
22/wsj_2229:Of course, Washington hadn't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle, and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect, but those preliminary steps shouldn't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday. 
22/wsj_2229:After all, the stock market's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators.
22/wsj_2229:Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington's bashing of Wall Street?
22/wsj_2229:To the extent that Friday's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage, the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior.
22/wsj_2229:The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings.
22/wsj_2229:The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate. 
22/wsj_2229:The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on Gray Friday, while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily.
22/wsj_2229:If you identify with the besieged managers, you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington.
22/wsj_2229:Any such attempt to distinguish "good debt" from "bad debt," or to draw the line at a particular industry, such as the airlines, is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general. 
22/wsj_2229:Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs, Panama and the deficit, all of them parades that seem never to end. 
22/wsj_2229:Mr. Jarrell, former top economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission, teaches at the University of Rochester's Simon Business School. 
22/wsj_2230:Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning, with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising 618.69 points to close the morning session at 35087.38.
22/wsj_2230:In the first 25 minutes of Tuesday's trading the Nikkei index soared 664.83 points, to 35133.83.
22/wsj_2230:Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo, but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash. 
22/wsj_2230:Still, despite the sudden reappearance of stock-market turbulence, managers of Japanese investment funds said they weren't planning to unload U.S. or European equities. 
22/wsj_2230:But in the absence of panicky trading, its presence was never overtly felt. 
22/wsj_2230:At the close, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at 34468.69, down 647.33 points, or 1.8%.
22/wsj_2230:A midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session, but the rally failed in the afternoon, and the market closed near the day's low. 
22/wsj_2230:The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year.
22/wsj_2230:But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago, during the October 1987 global stock market crash. 
22/wsj_2230:This time, Wall Street's plunge of 6.9% Friday was followed by yesterday's 1.8% loss in Tokyo. 
22/wsj_2230:But in New York yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 88.12 to close at 2657.38 on heavy volume of 416,290,000 shares, although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market. 
22/wsj_2230:Isao Ushikubo, general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Co., also was optimistic.
22/wsj_2230:He said Friday's Wall Street decline was "well within the range of volatility" that Yasuda Trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy. 
22/wsj_2230:Richard Chenevix-Trench, a director at Hong Kong-based Baring International Fund Managers Ltd., said the market probably hasn't hit bottom yet but is close. "If New York doesn't collapse, I see maybe another 5% on the downside, not counting the risk of bad news out of China," he said. 
22/wsj_2230:London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, the most closely watched market barometer, ended at its intraday high of 2163.4, down 70.5, or 3.2%.
22/wsj_2230:The decline in the German Stock Index of 203.56 points, or 12.8%, to 1385.72 was the Frankfurt market's steepest fall ever. 
22/wsj_2230:Analysts cited memories of two years ago, when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued to decline steeply for the next three months. 
22/wsj_2230:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
22/wsj_2230:Last week's best and worst performing stocks among those issues that make up 80% of the world's stock market capitalization (in local currency) 
22/wsj_2231:What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state's attorney general? 
22/wsj_2231:The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby: the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment.
22/wsj_2231:The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that don't meet the initiative's standards.
22/wsj_2231:In other words, California is presuming to take control of the nation's farm policy. 
22/wsj_2231:The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40%.
22/wsj_2231:The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
22/wsj_2231:That's also the day of the gubernatorial election. 
22/wsj_2231:While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional, it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through.
22/wsj_2231:Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific, anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric.
22/wsj_2231:Of course the state's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves.
22/wsj_2231:George Bush, for example, may decide that he doesn't want to be the President who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California.
22/wsj_2231:And some other segments of California's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs. 
22/wsj_2232:Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday's 190.58-point plunge, gaining 88.12 to 2657.38.
22/wsj_2232:It was the fourth-biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips, on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash. 
22/wsj_2232:A troubling sign: Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers, 975 to 749, and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday's late Big Board plunge.
22/wsj_2232:Meanwhile, in a divergence in two of the market's most important indicators, the Dow industrials' sister average, the 20-stock Dow Jones Transportation Average, tumbled 102.06 to 1304.23 -- its second-worst decline next to the 164.78-point fall during the 1987 crash. 
22/wsj_2232:UAL, the takeover stock at the center of Friday's 190.58-point market plunge, fell 56 7/8 to 222 7/8 on nearly 2.3 million shares. 
22/wsj_2232:Overall, "this is a pleasant rally but it's very selective," said Arthur Cashin Jr., a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board. "Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory.
22/wsj_2232:The rally gave credence, at least for now, to the pre-trading declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday's market debacle was "an abnormal condition, and not a disaster." 
22/wsj_2232:But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average, including Eastman Kodak and General Motors, couldn't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday's late-afternoon rout.
22/wsj_2232:At 9:45, Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late -- opened down 2 3/4 to 117. 
22/wsj_2232:More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour, as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood. 
22/wsj_2232:There was heavy stock-index arbitrage, as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets.
22/wsj_2232:The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized.
22/wsj_2232:The Dow accelerated its slide, losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading. 
22/wsj_2232:The program traders were in there, too, of course.
22/wsj_2232:But according to one trader, the programmers "didn't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was {also} a lot of bargain-hunting" by institutions. 
22/wsj_2232:Roland M. Machold, director of the New Jersey Division of Investment, which oversees $29 billion in investments, said the "first thing we did was to double our orders" yesterday morning. "With the market down like this, we'll probably take another $50 million and put it in" the market. 
22/wsj_2232:According to Big Board officials, Disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday; it was one of the seven stocks that couldn't finish trading that day.
22/wsj_2232:However, Disney specialist Robert Fagenson said: "I would be surprised if Goldman represented 4% of the opening volume." 
22/wsj_2232:There wasn't a lot of panic selling, either domestically or internationally. . . .Not like Friday where they just took {the market} apart." 
22/wsj_2232:But in another dramatic burst, the Dow tacked on 42 points in five minutes, and at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74. 
22/wsj_2232:Grinned Griffith Peck, a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's OTC department: "I tell you, this market acts healthy." Around him, scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy; their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water to cool them off. 
22/wsj_2232:Over the weekend, clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning. 
22/wsj_2232:However, according to one analyst, the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday. "Futures were pulling the stock market higher," said Donald Selkin, head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 
22/wsj_2232:But yesterday, even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck, "we expected (the halts) and it wasn't too bad," said Donaldson's Mr. Eppel, who had been critical of the specialists' performance on Friday.
22/wsj_2232:Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index. 
22/wsj_2232:No sector of the market has been spared during the past two days' gyrations.
22/wsj_2232:Because of the UAL and AMR tumbles, airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday. 
22/wsj_2232:Shares of International Business Machines, which reported earnings yesterday, finished at 103, up 1, after slipping below 100 during Friday's session for the first time in five years. 
22/wsj_2232:Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings.
22/wsj_2232:At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday, the Big Board's Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel. 
22/wsj_2232:Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies weren't responsible for triggering Friday's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months.
22/wsj_2232:Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded in the final 90 minutes of Friday's session, when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated, were program-related, he said. 
22/wsj_2232:Program trades make up 10% of the exchange's volume on an average day, but despite the increase Friday, it was "certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline," Mr. Phelan said. 
22/wsj_2232:Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday. "Obviously, every time we get this kind of reaction, it's going to make everybody nervous, including me," he said.
22/wsj_2232:Meanwhile, Peter DaPuzzo, Shearson's head of retail equity trading, praised institutional investors in the OTC market, who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors. "The institutions can't be criticized for their behavior," Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview. "It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19.
22/wsj_2232:They didn't panic during the first round of selling this morning.
22/wsj_2232:Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday's plunge was admirable, because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and weren't reopened before the close. "They did an excellent job," Mr. Phelan said of the specialists.
22/wsj_2233:The anti-defense Greens wanted a Washington federal appeals court to block today's scheduled liftoff long enough for them to ask the World Court to "order" a permanent cancellation of the $1.5 billion flight.
22/wsj_2233:A three-judge appeals panel yesterday refused to comply, though liberal Judge Pat Wald went out of her way to deny that this was a "frivolous" case.
22/wsj_2233:Of course it was.
22/wsj_2234:A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii. 
22/wsj_2234:The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic, and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less.
22/wsj_2234:The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry, which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years. 
22/wsj_2234:But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states, such as North Carolina.
22/wsj_2234:Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest, the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane, but politically important, projects of members.
22/wsj_2234:In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees, the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida, Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor. "Anybody can vote as they want," said Rep. William Lehman (D., Fla.), head of the House conferees. "But if you make a request, you should support the committee." 
22/wsj_2234:Leery of the costs -- and, critics say, competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver. 
22/wsj_2234:The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50% of the gates.
22/wsj_2234:But this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the Transportation Department to review the costs of the first phase, expected to cost about $2 billion. 
22/wsj_2234:The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program, but the list of qualified airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy.
22/wsj_2234:The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $200 for each passenger in subsidies. 
22/wsj_2235:Enjoying several blockbuster movie hits including "Batman," Los Angeles-based Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. reported earnings for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 of $5.8 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss. 
22/wsj_2235:Warner sued Sony and Guber-Peters late last week; Sony and Guber-Peters have countersued, charging Warner with attempting to interfere in Sony's acquisition of the two companies. 
22/wsj_2235:Guber-Peters's net income in the latest quarter compared with a net loss of $6.9 million, or 62 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
22/wsj_2235:The company said revenue rose 138%, to $10.9 million from $4.6 million, reflecting the success of its movies "Gorillas in the Mist" and "Rainman," as well as the box-office smash "Batman." 
22/wsj_2236:A group including Jon M. Huntsman of Salt Lake City, said it boosted its stake in Aristech Chemical Corp. to 8.36% of the the common shares outstanding. 
22/wsj_2236:As previously reported, Huntsman Holdings Corp., owned by Jon M. Huntsman and other members of his family, proposed that Banstar Corp., an affiliate of Huntsman Holdings, acquire Aristech in a friendly transaction for $25-a-share in cash, or $817.5 million. 
22/wsj_2237:Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland, so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package.
22/wsj_2237:Last month, the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature, the Sejm, in democratic procedures.
22/wsj_2237:Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort "the first gift of democracy." The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse.
22/wsj_2237:It is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the 1,376 page, 13-pound reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the United States.
22/wsj_2238:Waterford Wedgwood PLC, a financially troubled Irish maker of fine crystal and Wedgwood china, reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to 10.6 million Irish punts ($14.9 million) from 5.8 million Irish punts a year earlier. 
22/wsj_2238:The results for the half were worse than market expectations, which suggested an interim loss of around 10 million Irish punts.
22/wsj_2238:The company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of 14 million Irish punts, compared with a loss of 9.3 million Irish punts for the year-earlier period.
22/wsj_2238:Waterford said the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected to enhance the company's long-term prospects. 
22/wsj_2239:Our markets were closely tied to the stock market," said Joel Kazis, manager of trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "Friday's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs," he said. 
22/wsj_2239:That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high-quality Treasury bonds, which are safer than other types of securities.
22/wsj_2239:But when stocks began to climb instead, prices of Treasury bonds declined. 
22/wsj_2239:Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios.
22/wsj_2239:The closely watched rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks, slid to about 8 3/4% last week, down from its perceived target level of about 9%.
22/wsj_2239:The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy.
22/wsj_2239:After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on Friday, they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday.
22/wsj_2239:But prices of junk bonds, which were battered Friday in near standstill trading, rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session.
22/wsj_2239:"I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds," said John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc. 
22/wsj_2239:Many U.S. trading operations, wanting to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U.S. trading would begin, were fully staffed during the Tokyo trading session. 
22/wsj_2239:"Most of the action was during the night session," said Michael Moore, trading manager at Continental Bank. 
22/wsj_2239:The bond market's focus on stock activity was so strong yesterday that it overshadowed today's slate of economic data, which includes the government's report on August U.S. merchandise trade and September industrial production. 
22/wsj_2239:Industrial production is expected to have declined 0.2%, according to a consensus of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.
22/wsj_2239:A widening of that magnitude, said one New York trader, is "not a favorable number. . . . It could do damage to us." 
22/wsj_2239:Meanwhile, agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market today when the Federal Home Loan Bank prices a $2.3 billion offering of one-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year maturities. 
22/wsj_2239:Tomorrow, the Resolution Funding Corp. will provide details of its first bond issue, which is expected to total between $4 billion and $6 billion and carry a maturity greater than 20 years.
22/wsj_2239:Resolution Funding is a division of Resolution Trust Corp., the new federal agency created to bail out the nation's troubled thrifts. 
22/wsj_2239:"There's lots of supply," the New York trader said. "We have a couple or three tough weeks coming." 
22/wsj_2239:Prices of Treasury bonds tumbled in moderate to active trading. 
22/wsj_2239:The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted late at a price of 101 19/32, compared with a closing price of 103 12/32 Friday.
22/wsj_2239:The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 3/32 for a yield of 7.97%, compared with 101 9/32 to yield 7.84%. 
22/wsj_2239:The average discount rate on new three-month Treasury bills was 7.37%, the lowest since the average of 7.36% at the auction on Oct. 17, 1988.
22/wsj_2239:The average discount rate was 7.42% on new six-month bills, the lowest since the average of 7.35% at the auction on July 31, 1989. 
22/wsj_2239:Mortgage securities gave up most of Friday's gains as active issues ended 24/32 to 30/32 point lower. 
22/wsj_2239:Traders said there were some busy dealings in Freddie Mac and Federal National Mortgage Association securities because underwriters from last week's heavy slate of real estate mortgage investment conduit issues moved to gather collateral for new deals. 
22/wsj_2239:Offsetting the Remic-related purchases were continued heavy sales by mortgage originators, which are producing increased amounts of fixed-rate mortgage-backed issues with lower rates. 
22/wsj_2239:Trading was hectic during the morning, with players trying to gauge whether equities would continue Friday's free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness.
22/wsj_2239:Tax-exempts started the session flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion, but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the October 1987 crash wasn't at hand. 
22/wsj_2239:Traders said retail investors seemed to be hugging the sidelines until a measure of volatility is wrung out of the market. 
22/wsj_2239:New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was off 3/4 at 98 1/2 bid, yielding 7.32%, up 0.07 percentage point from late Friday. 
22/wsj_2239:Florida Board of Education's 7 1/4% issue of 2023 was 5/8 point weaker at 99 1/2 bid.
22/wsj_2239:The 7 1/8% issue of Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority of New York, due 2019, was off 5/8 at 98 1/8 bid.
22/wsj_2239:And Fairfax County, Va., Water Authority's 7 1/4% issue of 2027 was down 3/4 at 99 7/8 bid. 
22/wsj_2240:BMA Corp., Kansas City, Mo., said it's weighing "strategic alternatives," for its Business Men's Assurance Co. unit, and is contacting possible buyers of the life and health insurance operation. 
22/wsj_2240:A BMA spokesman said "runaway medical costs" have made health insurance "a significant challenge," and margins also have been pinched by changes in the mix of life-insurance products consumers now demand.
22/wsj_2240:The Business Men's Assurance unit represented about $288 million of the company's $488 million in 1988 revenue, and the unit's operating income was about $10 million, said the spokesman. 
22/wsj_2241:Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. said it raised its stake in ADT Ltd. of Bermuda to 29.4% from 28%. 
22/wsj_2241:A spokesman for Laidlaw declined to disclose the price the Toronto transportation and waste services concern paid for the additional shares, which he said were acquired "over the last couple of weeks." 
22/wsj_2241:The spokesman said Laidlaw wouldn't increase its stake in ADT beyond 30% "without a great deal of thought" because of British takeover regulations that require a company acquiring more than 30% to extend an offer to the rest of the company's shareholders.
22/wsj_2242:Nintendo Co., a Japanese maker of video games, electronic information systems and playing cards, posted a 23% unconsolidated surge in pretax profit to 61.41 billion yen ($429 million) from 50 billion yen ($349.9 million) for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31. 
22/wsj_2242:Pershare net fell to 423.3 yen from 457.7 yen because of expenses and capital adjustments. 
22/wsj_2243:Hertz Corp. of Park Ridge, N.J., said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to sell its Hertz Equipment Rental Corp. unit. 
22/wsj_2243:Hertz Equipment had operating profit before depreciation of $90 million on revenue of $150 million in 1988.
22/wsj_2243:The closely held Hertz Corp. had annual revenue of close to $2 billion in 1988, of which $1.7 billion was contributed by its Hertz Rent A Car operations world-wide. 
22/wsj_2243:Hertz Equipment is a major supplier of rental equipment in the U.S., France, Spain and the U.K.
22/wsj_2244:Interspec Inc. reported a net loss of $2.4 million for the fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31.

22/wsj_2244:The manufacturer of ultrasound diagnostic systems, based in Ambler, Pa., reported a nine-month net loss of $2.43 million compared with net income of $2.71 million, or 44 cents a share, for the nine-month period a year earlier. 
22/wsj_2245:Allegheny Ludlum Corp. expects to report third-quarter net of about $34 million, or $1.50 a share, down from $38.4 million, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier, Richard P. Simmons, chairman and chief executive officer, told institutional investors in New York. 
22/wsj_2245:Sales for the Pittsburgh-based producer of specialty steels and other materials fell to about $265 million in the third quarter from $320.5 million a year earlier, he said. 
22/wsj_2245:He said the third-quarter estimate indicates profit for the nine months of $4.65 a share, "almost equal to the full-year 1988 earnings" of $108.6 million, or $4.81 a share.
22/wsj_2245:In the first nine months of 1988, net was $85 million, or $3.76 a share. 
22/wsj_2246:U.S. Banknote Co. said it again extended the expiration date of its $7-a-share tender offer for International Banknote Co. to Nov. 15. 
22/wsj_2246:Both of the New York-based companies print stock certificates and currency. 
22/wsj_2246:U.S. Banknote said Citibank extended the expiration date of its commitment for senior secured financing to Nov. 15. 
22/wsj_2246:Closely held U.S. Banknote offered the $7 a share, or $126 million, for as many as 14.9 million shares, or 78.6%, of International Banknote's shares outstanding.
22/wsj_2246:U.S. Banknote said that as of Oct. 13, 16.1 million shares, or about 84.3% of the fully diluted shares outstanding, had been tendered. 
22/wsj_2247:Gitano Group Inc. said it agreed to buy 50% of Regatta Sport Ltd., a closely held apparel maker, with the assumption of $3 million of contingent debt. 
22/wsj_2247:Under the terms of the contract, New York-based Gitano has the option to acquire the remaining 50% of Regatta, a maker of men's and women's clothes sold primarily in department stores, under certain conditions.
22/wsj_2247:In 1989, Regatta will have sales "in excess of $10 million" and will show a profit, Mr. Parker said. 
22/wsj_2248:Enron Corp., Houston, said the sale of preference units of its newly formed Enron NGL Partners L.P. master limited partnership subsidiary will result in an undetermined gain in the fourth quarter. 
22/wsj_2248:In the year-ago quarter, the natural gas concern had net income of $25.2 million, or 34 cents a share, on revenue of about $1.46 billion.
22/wsj_2248:Those results included a $2.7 million charge related to the retirement of debt. 
22/wsj_2248:In a related move, Enron said it increased the number of the partnership's units it will offer to 6,930,000 from 5,500,000.
22/wsj_2248:Enron said each unit will be priced in the $19-to-$21 range and will represent about 80% of the partnership equity. 
22/wsj_2249:Arthur M. Goldberg said he extended his unsolicited tender offer of $32 a share tender offer, or $154.3 million, for Di Giorgio Corp. to Nov. 1. 
22/wsj_2249:DIG Acquisition Corp., the New Jersey investor's acquisition vehicle, said that as of the close of business yesterday, 560,839 shares had been tendered.
22/wsj_2249:Including the stake DIG already held, DIG holds a total of about 25% of Di Giorgio's shares on a fully diluted basis. 
22/wsj_2249:DIG is a unit of DIG Holding Corp., a unit of Rose Partners L.P. Mr. Goldberg is the sole general partner in Rose Partners. 
22/wsj_2250:After years of fading into the background, two-tone photography is coming back. 
22/wsj_2250:Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black-and-white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans, shoes and liquor.
22/wsj_2250:What's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion, home furnishings and cinematography.
22/wsj_2250:And classic black-and-white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes, spurred, in part, by the backlash against colorization of old films. 
22/wsj_2250:"The pendulum is swinging back to black and white," says Richard DeMoulin, the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co. 's professional photography division. 
22/wsj_2250:Until two years ago, sales of black-and-white film had been declining steadily since the 1960s.
22/wsj_2250:At Kodak, which largely ignored the market for years, black-and-white film sales now account for nearly 15% of the company's $3 billion in film and paper sales annually, up from 10% three years ago. 
22/wsj_2250:The Rochester, N.Y., photographic giant recently began marketing T-Max 3200, one of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films.
22/wsj_2250:Aimed at commercial photographers, the film can be used in very low light without sacrificing quality, says Donald Franz of Photofinishing Newsletter. 
22/wsj_2250:Also trying to snare a portion of the $2 billion-a-year industry is Agfa Corp., a unit of Bayer AG. Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner to endorse a new line of black-and-white paper that's geared to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak's papers.
22/wsj_2250:Slated for market by the end of the year, the paper "could have been introduced a long time ago but the market wasn't there then," says an Agfa spokesman. 
22/wsj_2250:The biggest beneficiary of the black-and-white revival is likely to be International Paper Co. 's Ilford division, known in the industry for its premium products.
22/wsj_2250:Sales of Ilford's four varieties of black-and-white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market, although the company won't say by exactly how much. "We hope the trend lasts," says Laurie DiCara, Ilford's marketing communications director. 
22/wsj_2250:For baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color, black and white seems eye-catching and exotic. "It has an archival, almost nostalgic quality to it," says Owen B. Butler, the chairman of the applied photography department at Rochester Institute of Technology. "You can shift out of reality with black and white," he adds. 
22/wsj_2250:Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives, who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising.
22/wsj_2250:Processing of black-and-white commercial film jumped 24% last year to 18.7 million rolls. 
22/wsj_2250:Consider Gap Inc., whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of Hollywood stars, artists and other well-known personalities modeling the retailer's jeans and T-shirts.
22/wsj_2250:Richard Crisman, the account manager for the campaign, says Gap didn't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors. 
22/wsj_2250:Typically, it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned. 
22/wsj_2250:Intent on wooing customers, the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black-and-white photography classes. 
22/wsj_2250:Similarly, Agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges, offering free black-and-white film and paper as prizes.
22/wsj_2250:Charles Beseler Co., a leading maker of photographic enlargers, introduced last month a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at teen-agers who want to process their own black-and-white photographs.
22/wsj_2250:The kit, which has a suggested retail price of $250 and has already become a bestseller, was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children's photography equipment. "It seems computers as hobbies have waned," says Ian Brightman, Beseler's chairman and chief executive officer. 
22/wsj_2250:But some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad.
22/wsj_2250:They cite the emergence of still electronic photography, more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints. 
22/wsj_2250:"Black and white hasn't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color," says Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute. "The color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago.
22/wsj_2250:But when Popular Photography, a leading magazine for photographers, selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography's 150th anniversary, all were black and white. "It's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally," says Alfred DeBat of Professional Photographers of America. "That's the appeal." 
22/wsj_2252:A. and Societe National Elf Aquitaine, the state oil companies of Italy and France, respectively, submitted an offer to buy Gatoil Suisse S.A.
22/wsj_2252:Gatoil Suisse owns an oil refinery in Switzerland with a capacity of 70,000 barrels a day, along with a network of gasoline retailing outlets. 
22/wsj_2253:The barometer, developed by analysts at Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research here, reached a record high of 223.0 in August, the latest month available, and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then. 
22/wsj_2253:The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March.
22/wsj_2253:The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator, which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100. 
22/wsj_2253:In contrast, the Commerce Department's widely followed index of leading indicators, while up in August, has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year.
22/wsj_2253:Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year's end. 
22/wsj_2253:But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index "makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely," says Geoffrey H. Moore, the director of the Columbia facility. 
22/wsj_2253:A leading authority on the business cycle, Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group, the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end.
22/wsj_2253:"No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks," Mr. Moore reports. 
22/wsj_2253:Based largely on the recent strength in their index, called the long leading indicator, the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well.
22/wsj_2253:Underlying this optimism is the index's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries, as the case may be, by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators.
22/wsj_2253:Over the full post-World War II era, the Columbia index, on the average, has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries. 
22/wsj_2253:A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate bond-price index, which is not a part of the Commerce index.
22/wsj_2253:Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries, the M2 version of the money supply, adjusted for inflation, and the volume of new home-building permits. 
22/wsj_2253:Notably absent from the Columbia index is the stock market, which Mr. Moore says "is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy's long-range prospects, though it still is useful for anticipating some short-run twists and turns." 
22/wsj_2253:As recently as 1975, the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index.
22/wsj_2253:It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100, compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components. 
22/wsj_2253:The stock market has lost some precursory power, analysts at the Columbia center claim, because of the growing impact of international developments. 
22/wsj_2253:"Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy," Mr. Moore says, citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets, the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital.
22/wsj_2253:He also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market's relevancy to the economic outlook. 
22/wsj_2254:The value of the acquisition wasn't disclosed. 
22/wsj_2254:The move is in line with BSN's strategy of gradually building its share of the European pasta market through external growth.
22/wsj_2254:Birkel is West Germany's second-biggest producer of pasta, with sales of 250 million marks ($133.4 million) in 1988.
22/wsj_2254:It has 750 workers at three production units in southwest Germany, and is that nation's leading producer of pasta sauces. 
22/wsj_2254:The French group currently ranks second after Barilla Group of Italy, whose sales are chiefly in the Italian market. 
22/wsj_2255:Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it reduced its rating on $281 million of senior and subordinated debt of this thrift holding company, to C from Ca, saying it believes bondholders will recover only "negligible principal." The agency said it confirmed American Continental's preferred stock rating at C. American Continental's thrift unit, Los Angeles-based Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, is in receivership and the parent company has filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 
22/wsj_2255:CENTRUST SAVINGS BANK (Miami) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded its ratings on the subordinated debt of CenTrust to Caa from B-3.
22/wsj_2255:The downgrades were prompted, Moody's said, by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on CenTrust's preferred stock.
22/wsj_2255:Moody's also said it believed the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to Great Western Bank could, if completed, endanger the thrift's funding and market position. 
22/wsj_2256:THE STOCK MARKET AVOIDED a repeat of Black Monday as prices recovered from an early slide, spurred by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders.
22/wsj_2256:The rally erased about half of Friday's 190.58-point plunge, but analysts are cautious about the market's outlook. 
22/wsj_2256:Leveraged buy-outs of airlines would be subject to approval by the transportation secretary under a bill passed by a House subcommittee. 
22/wsj_2256:The regulation had prevented pipeline firms from passing part of $1 billion in costs along to customers. 
22/wsj_2256:Blue Arrow of Britain plans to return to the name Manpower and take a big write-off.
22/wsj_2256:The moves may help the firm solidify its dominance of the U.S. temporary-help market. 
22/wsj_2257:Reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $1 million or more.
22/wsj_2257:COMMERCIAL PAPER: High-grade unsecured notes sold through dealers by major corporations in multiples of $1,000:8.40% 30 days; 8.33% 60 days; 8.26% 90 days. 
22/wsj_2257:CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT: 8.05% one month; 8.02% two months; 8% three months; 7.98% six months; 7.95% one year.
22/wsj_2257:Average of top rates paid by major New York banks on primary new issues of negotiable C.D.s, usually on amounts of $1 million and more.
22/wsj_2257:The average of interbank offered rates for dollar deposits in the London market based on quotations at five major banks. 
22/wsj_2257:TREASURY BILLS: Results of the Monday, October 16, 1989, auction of short-term U.S. government bills, sold at a discount from face value in units of $10,000 to $1 million: 7.37%, 13 weeks; 7.42%, 26 weeks. 
22/wsj_2257:Annualized average rate of return after expenses for the past 30 days; not a forecast of future returns. 
22/wsj_2258:Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is the market leader for traditional microprocessors with its 8086 family that forms the heart of IBM-compatible personal computers. 
22/wsj_2258:Under the agreement, Intel will invest $3 million to acquire a 4% stake in Alliant, a maker of minisupercomputers for scientists and engineers.
22/wsj_2259:In 1988 the Cincinnati company earned $3.1 million, or 32 cents a share, on revenue of $148.5 million. 
22/wsj_2259:The business, based in St. Louis, had sales of more than $14 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, Omnicare said. 
22/wsj_2260:Burmah Oil PLC, a British independent oil and specialty chemicals marketing concern, said SHV Holdings N.V. of the Netherlands has built up a 6.7% stake in the company. 
22/wsj_2260:James Alexander, a Burmah spokesman, said SHV had previously owned "a little under 5%" of Burmah for about two years.
22/wsj_2260:The Dutch company hadn't notified Burmah of its reason for increasing the stake, he said. 
22/wsj_2260:SHV, which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC, has been pegged by speculators as a possible suitor for Burmah Oil in recent weeks.
22/wsj_2260:SHV also owns 40% of Calor. 
22/wsj_2260:Burmah, which owns the Castrol brand of lubricant oils, reported a 17% rise in net income to #43.5 million ($68.3 million) in the first half. 
22/wsj_2261:J.P. Industries Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to sell its Builders' Hardware Group to closely held Nalcor Inc. of Beverly Hills, Calif. 
22/wsj_2261:The group consists of Weslock Corp. and JPI Modern Inc. J.P. Industries, which is based in Ann Arbor, Mich., said the sale completes a previously announced program to divest itself of its hardware and plumbing supplies operations.
22/wsj_2261:The company's remaining business is the manufacture and sale of engine and transmissions products for industrial and transportation applications. 
22/wsj_2262:A unit of troubled Southmark Corp., the operator of nursing homes and retirement centers said it sustained a net loss of $1.6 million, or nine cents a share, compared with net income of $1.3 million, or eight cents a share, a year earlier.
22/wsj_2262:The company said the $3.1 million reserve was created to reflect doubt about the collectability of receivables owed to National Heritage by some of the real estate partnerships it manages.
22/wsj_2263:United Biscuits (Holdings) PLC, a British food producer, announced the creation of a European group to bring together its trading interests in the region. 
22/wsj_2263:The new group will comprise all of United Biscuit's manufacturing and marketing operations in the food sector apart from those based in the U.S. 
22/wsj_2263:United Biscuits said the combined group, which will include businesses such as McVities biscuits and Terry's confectionery, will have annual sales of more than #1.5 billion ($2.35 billion) and trading profit of more than #160 million ($251 million). 
22/wsj_2264:The U.S. journalist's "crime" was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election's fairness, Bryan O'Linn, was openly sympathetic to SWAPO. Shortly after that, Mr. O'Linn had Scott Stanley arrested and his passport confiscated.
22/wsj_2264:The Stanley affair doesn't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when SWAPO starts running the government.
22/wsj_2264:To the extent Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong, it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring South Africa.
22/wsj_2264:SWAPO has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U.N. General Assembly declared it the "sole, authentic representative" of Namibia's people in 
22/wsj_2264:Last year, the U.S. brokered a peace settlement to remove Cuba's "Afrika Korps" from Angola and hold "free and fair" elections that would end South Africa's control of Namibia.
22/wsj_2264:In July, Mr. Stanley, editor of American Press International, a Washington D.C.-based conservative wire service, visited Namibia to report on the U.N.-monitored election campaign.
22/wsj_2264:He interviewed Mr. O'Linn, head of a commission charged with investigating electoral intimidation, and reported that Mr. O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO and indeed had defended its leaders in court.
22/wsj_2264:Both the State Department and the Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press have protested Mr. Stanley's detention.
22/wsj_2264:Mr. Stanley's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to derail Namibia's elections.
22/wsj_2264:The U.S. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results.
22/wsj_2265:Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge Friday. 
22/wsj_2265:Later, however, it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors. 
22/wsj_2265:Gold, the traditional haven in times of financial crisis, continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar, rising early in the day as the currency fell, and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered. 
22/wsj_2265:Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved.
22/wsj_2265:Livestock and meat prices, however, dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork. 
22/wsj_2265:PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently, first falling and then later rising.
22/wsj_2265:The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $3.90 an ounce at $371.20, after trading as high as $374.
22/wsj_2265:On Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the October contract tacked on further gains, rising to as high as $491.50 for a gain of almost $20 on top of the Friday advances, before giving up almost $10 of that at the close.
22/wsj_2265:Yesterday's October gain of $4 was miniscule compared with that.
22/wsj_2265:One analyst, Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co., New York, said the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise, with or without the stock market. "What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened," said Mr. Cardillo.
22/wsj_2265:Finally, according to Mr. Cardillo, the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit, when the figures are released today.
22/wsj_2265:ENERGY: Worried that Friday's 190-point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy, petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices.
22/wsj_2265:Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow, following several days of significant gains.
22/wsj_2265:The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand.
22/wsj_2265:Indeed, after reacting early in the trading day to Friday's plummet, futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market's partial recovery yesterday. 
22/wsj_2265:Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use.
22/wsj_2265:Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle, the contracting out of work by the company.
22/wsj_2265:COTTON: Futures prices eased, more in reaction to Hurricane Jerry than to any influence of the stock market.
22/wsj_2265:The December contract ended with a loss of 0.22 cent a pound, at 74.48 cents.
22/wsj_2265:Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana, which is part of the Mississippi Delta cotton-growing area.
22/wsj_2265:However, after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane, prices began to slip late Friday, Mr. Simon said.
22/wsj_2265:Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend, Mr. Simon said.
22/wsj_2265:A price-depressing factor, one analyst said, was that India, which had been expected to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market, didn't make any purchases.
22/wsj_2265:Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market. "India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar, it could buy at lower prices," said Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York.
22/wsj_2265:FARM PRODUCTS: The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge Friday will linger in the minds of U.S. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket, which would hurt demand for beef and pork. 
22/wsj_2265:The price of the hog contract for October delivery dropped its maximum permissible daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound. 
22/wsj_2265:The prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering.
22/wsj_2265:Earlier in the session, the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows.
22/wsj_2265:A broad rally began when several major processors began buying futures contracts, apparently to take advantage of the price dip. 
22/wsj_2266:A company spokesman said he believed the confusion was caused when James Batten, Knight-Ridder's chairman and chief executive, told New York analysts two weeks ago that Knight-Ridder's earnings per share for the first nine months of 1989 would "be behind a little bit" from like period of 
22/wsj_2266:The spokesman said he was "comfortable" with revised analysts' projections that the company would report earnings of between 62 cents and 64 cents a share, compared with the 53 cents a share it reported for the 1988 third quarter. 
22/wsj_2266:Knight-Ridder said it agreed with estimates that net income for all of 1989 would be around $2.86 a share, compared with $2.59 a share a year earlier. 
22/wsj_2267:The offer has an indicated value of $268 million. 
22/wsj_2267:DD Acquisition is a partnership of Unicorp Canada Corp. 's Kingsbridge Capital Group unit and Cara Operations Ltd.
22/wsj_2267:As previously reported, under the terms of a confidentiality agreement with Dunkin' Donuts, the partners agreed to keep their offer open until Nov. 1, and not to acquire any additional shares except through a tender offer expiring on that date. 
22/wsj_2267:DD Acquisition said that it already owns 15% of the common shares of the doughnut shop chain and that as of the close of business Friday an additional 11% had been tendered to its offer. 
22/wsj_2268:Golden West Financial Corp., riding above the turbulence that has troubled most of the thrift industry, posted a 16% increase of third-quarter earnings to $41.8 millon, or 66 cents a share.
22/wsj_2268:Herbert M. Sandler, chairman and chief executive officer of the Oakland, Calif., savings-and-loan holding company, credited the high number of loans added to the company's portfolio over the last 12 months for broadening its earning asset base and improving profit performance. 
22/wsj_2269:Whirlpool Corp., Benton Harbor, Mich., said it has developed a process to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, that previously entered the atmosphere during in-home repair of refrigerators and freezers. 
22/wsj_2269:The maker of home appliances said the process, which involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center, is already in use at a number of its service centers, and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring.
22/wsj_2269:Earlier repairs vented the CFCs out of the home through a hose directly into the atmosphere. 
22/wsj_2269:But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth's ozone layer, and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use, or at least emission, of the substance.
22/wsj_2269:Whirpool said, "We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of CFC use in appliance manufacture." 
22/wsj_2270:Maxus Energy Corp., Dallas, said it discovered a new oil field northeast of its previously discovered Intan Field in the southeast Sumatra area of Indonesia. 
22/wsj_2270:However, Maxus said it believes the reserves in the field are about 10 million barrels of oil.
22/wsj_2270:The Intan Field has estimated reserves of 50 million barrels and the Widuri Field has estimated reserves of 225 million barrels. 
22/wsj_2271:Environmental Systems Co. said it is restating its results to reduce its reported net income for the first nine months of its fiscal year after discovering it took tax credits that already had been taken last year. 
22/wsj_2271:The company previously reported net of $2.3 million, or 15 cents a share. 
22/wsj_2271:But because of confusion, it took those credits again in reporting its results through the first nine months.
22/wsj_2272:Memotec said under the agreement, ISI, a Braintree, Mass., provider of computer software and services to the insurance industry, will merge with a U.S. unit of Memotec created for that purpose.
22/wsj_2272:Memotec is a Montreal-based maker of telecommunications products and provider of telecommunications and computer services. 
22/wsj_2272:Memotec said the agreement calls for it to make a $20-a-share cash tender offer for all shares outstanding of ISI.
22/wsj_2272:But it said Charles Johnston, ISI chairman and president, agreed to sell his 60% stake in ISI to Memotec upon completion of the tender offer for a combination of cash, Memotec stock and debentures.
22/wsj_2272:Memotec said the tender offer is conditioned on, among other things, holders tendering at least 15% of the shares outstanding, other than the shares held by Mr. Johnston. 
22/wsj_2273:CMS Energy Corp., Jackson, Mich., said it has resumed the purchase of its common stock under a program approved by its directors in 1987. 
22/wsj_2273:At the time of the original announcement, CMS said its board authorized the purchase of as many as five million of its shares.
22/wsj_2273:In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, CMS Energy closed at $34.375 a share, down 62.5 cents, from the closing price of $37.375 a share on Thursday, before Friday's plunge. 
22/wsj_2274:Hughes Aircraft Co., a unit of General Motors Corp., said it agreed to purchase the Electro-Optics Technology division of Perkin-Elmer Corp. 
22/wsj_2274:Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.
22/wsj_2274:Perkin-Elmer, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., said the sale of the Danbury, Conn., unit is consistent with its restructuring strategy announced in April.
22/wsj_2274:Hughes of Los Angeles said the PerkinElmer unit's work complements efforts by its Electro-Optical and Data Systems group, which makes infrared sensors, military lasers and night vision equipment.
22/wsj_2275:The Communications Workers of America ratified a new regional contract and all but one of the local agreements with Bell Atlantic Corp. 
22/wsj_2275:Meanwhile, CWA and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers members remain on strike against Nynex Corp., the New York-based regional phone company.
22/wsj_2276:Among those sighing with relief was John H. Gutfreund, chairman of Salomon Brothers, who took to the firm's trading floor to monitor yesterday's events.
22/wsj_2276:As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board, stocks of many of the nation's biggest companies couldn't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers.
22/wsj_2276:By 10:10, the Dow Industrials were off 63.52 points, and the stock of UAL Corp., whose troubles had kicked off Friday's plunge, still hadn't opened. 
22/wsj_2276:It ended with a gain of 88.12 points. 
22/wsj_2276:The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain, in sharp contrast to Black Monday of 1987.
22/wsj_2276:And many arbitragers, already reeling from Friday's collapse of the UAL deal, were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, collapsed.
22/wsj_2276:The Frankfurt stock exchange was hardest hit of the major markets, with blue chips there falling 12.8%.
22/wsj_2276:Investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash: In this age of computerized trading, huge corrections or runups in a few hours' time must be expected.
22/wsj_2276:Stephen Boesel, a major money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, says, "There was less panic than in 1987: We had been through it once." In Somerset, Wis., Adrian Sween, who owns a supplier of nursing-home equipment and isn't active in the stock market, agrees. "I look at it as a ho-hum matter," he says. 
22/wsj_2276:Many major institutions, for example, came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on Friday. 
22/wsj_2276:Still, amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday's events, some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday's. "There is too much complacency," says money manager Barry Schrager. 
22/wsj_2276:So investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday's opening in Tokyo, where the Nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a rocky start.
22/wsj_2276:The average plunged some 600 points, or 1.7%, in the first 20 minutes of trading.
22/wsj_2276:Unlike two years ago, most of Japan's major investors chose to sit this calamity out.
22/wsj_2276:Clients "are all staying out" of the market, one Merrill trader says. 
22/wsj_2276:Frankfurt's opening was delayed a half hour because of a crush of sell orders. "The beginning was chaotic," says Nigel Longley, a broker for Commerzbank 
22/wsj_2276:In London, the view from the trading floor of an American securities firm, Jefferies & Co., also was troubling.
22/wsj_2276:The screen was a sea of red. "I see concern, but I don't see panic," says J. Francis Palamara, a New Yorker who runs the 15-trader office.
22/wsj_2276:But shortly before then, some of Wall Street's sharpest traders say, they sensed a turn. "The first thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was Treasury bonds were off," says Austin George, head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price. "It meant that people weren't running pell-mell to the safety of bonds." 
22/wsj_2276:Shortly after 10 a.m., the Major Market Index, a Chicago Board of Trade futures contract of 20 stocks designed to mimic the DJIA, exploded upward.
22/wsj_2276:"The MMI has gone better," shouted a trader in the London office of Shearson Lehman Hutton.
22/wsj_2276:Walt Disney Co., which had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday and was one of seven stocks that halted trading and never reopened that day, opened yesterday late at 114.5, down 8.5.
22/wsj_2276:Over the weekend, clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning. 
22/wsj_2276:Meanwhile, a test of the stock market's rally came at about 2 p.m., with the Dow at 2600, up 31 points on the day.
22/wsj_2276:The market closed minutes after reaching its high for the day of 
22/wsj_2276:Says James Norman, the mayor of Ava, Mo.: "I don't invest in stocks.
22/wsj_2276:I much prefer money I can put my hands on." While Mayor Norman found the market's performance Monday reassuring, he says, he remains uneasy. "We have half the experts saying one thing and half the other" about the course of the economy. 
22/wsj_2276:Ralph Holzfaster, a farmer and farm-supply store operator in Ogallala, Neb., says of the last few days events, "If anything good comes out of this, it might be that it puts some of these LBOs on the skids." 
22/wsj_2277:Skipper's Inc., Bellevue, Wash., said it signed a definitive merger agreement for a National Pizza Corp. unit to acquire the 90.6% of Skipper's Inc. it doesn't own for $11.50 a share, or about $28.1 million. 
22/wsj_2277:NP Acquisition Co., a National Pizza unit, plans to begin a tender offer for Skipper's on Friday, conditioned on at least two-thirds of Skipper's shares being tendered.
22/wsj_2277:For the 12 weeks ended Sept. 3, Skipper's had net income of $361,000, or 13 cents a share, compared with a net loss a year earlier.
22/wsj_2278:In what was considered the largest protest in the Communist state's 40-year history, at least 120,000 demonstrators marched through the southern city of Leipzig to press demands for democratic freedoms, opposition activists said.

22/wsj_2278:Secretary of State Baker, in a foreign policy speech, called for the reunification of Germany, saying it was the "legitimate right" of the German people. 
22/wsj_2278:At a meeting Friday, the Kremlin leader complained about recent articles that raised the possiblity of civil unrest, and accused the media of fueling panic buying of goods by publishing stories about impending shortages. 
22/wsj_2278:House-Senate conferees approved a permanent smoking ban on domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on flights of less than six hours to Alaska and Hawaii.
22/wsj_2278:The curbs would cover all but a small percentage of flights, and represent an expansion of the current ban on flights of less than two hours. 
22/wsj_2278:Wallach, an associate of ex-Attorney General Meese, was found guilty in August of taking $425,000 in illegal payoffs from the now-defunct defense contractor. 
22/wsj_2278:NASA resumed the countdown for today's launch of the space shuttle Atlantis, and a federal appeals court in Washington dismissed a lawsuit by anti-nuclear groups to delay the flight because the plutonium-powered Galileo space probe was aboard.
22/wsj_2278:The Bush administration is preparing to extend a ban on federal financing of research using fetal tissue, government sources said.

22/wsj_2279:British retail sales volume rose a provisional 0.4% in September from August and was up 2.2% from September 1988, the Department of Trade and Industry said. 
22/wsj_2280:Chicago investor William Farley agreed to sell three divisions of Cluett Peabody & Co. for about $600 million to Bidermann S.A., a closely held clothing maker based in Paris. 
22/wsj_2280:Shortly after completing the $1.56 billion acquisition of West Point-Pepperell Inc. in April, Mr. Farley's holding company, Farley Inc., said it was considering the sale of Cluett, a leading shirt maker and one of West Point-Pepperell's biggest units. 
22/wsj_2280:The companies said the agreement is subject to Bidermann's receipt of financing and to regulatory and other approvals.
22/wsj_2280:They said the sale is expected to be concluded by the end of November. 
22/wsj_2280:Mr. Farley said the sale of three of Cluett's four main divisions plus other "anticipated" West Point-Pepperell asset sales by December, should bring in a total of about $700 million.
22/wsj_2280:Mr. Farley followed a similar pattern when he acquired Northwest Industries Inc. and then sold much of its assets.
22/wsj_2280:But he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc., the underwear maker that he still controls and serves as chairman and chief executive. 
22/wsj_2280:In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1988, Cluett had operating profit of $37 million on sales of $757 million. 
22/wsj_2280:A spokesman said the company had sales of $400 million in 1988. 
22/wsj_2281:Britain's Blue Arrow PLC intends to change its name to Manpower PLC and write off a chunk of the nearly $1.2 billion in good will realized in the takeover of U.S.-based Manpower Inc. 
22/wsj_2281:The name change and good will write-off could help solidify Blue Arrow's dominance of the U.S. temporary-help market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday's market plunge.
22/wsj_2281:U.S. holders now own more than 60% of Blue Arrow compared with 9% last January. "In the U.S. market, the recognition of the Manpower name is infinitely stronger than Blue Arrow," Mr. Fromstein said. 
22/wsj_2281:The moves also could erase shareholders' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil. "It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past," said Doug Arthur, an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York.
22/wsj_2281:The proposed changes "all make a lot of sense to me," he added. 
22/wsj_2281:In a widely publicized boardroom coup, Mr. Fromstein ousted Antony Berry as Blue Arrow chief executive in January, a month after Mr. Berry had forced Mr. Fromstein out as the $1 million-a-year chief of Milwaukee-based Manpower.
22/wsj_2281:Blue Arrow was able to pull off the $1.34 billion takeover of Manpower in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies.
22/wsj_2281:Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm, operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets. 
22/wsj_2281:The British version shows "a handful of pounds of net worth" following the 1987 write-off of good will, while the American version reflects "$1 billion of net worth because almost none of {the good will} has been written off." 
22/wsj_2281:Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow's U.S. books in one fell swoop, but wouldn't specify how much.
22/wsj_2281:People close to Blue Arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk, with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of Manpower's good will. 
22/wsj_2281:The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1% in the 12 months ending Aug. 31, after sliding nearly 3.5% in July, said Kidder Peabody's Mr. Arthur. 
22/wsj_2281:Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of non-Manpower units in Britain.
22/wsj_2282:Last year's earnings of $1.3 million, including $815,000 from a restructuring gain, were far below the year-earlier $8.4 million. 
22/wsj_2282:Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule, in August 1988.
22/wsj_2282:But Mr. Sim has set a fresh target of $50 a share by the end of 
22/wsj_2282:Reaching that goal, says Robert T. Foote, Applied's chief financial officer, will require "efficient reinvestment" of cash by Applied and continuation of its healthy 19% rate of return on operating capital. 
22/wsj_2282:Applied, then a closely held company, was stagnating under the management of its controlling family.
22/wsj_2282:He was named chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 and became chairman last November. 
22/wsj_2283:The high court agreed to hear the state of California's challenge to the legality of the acquisition of Lucky Stores Inc., a supermarket chain, by American Stores Co. which owns another chain, Alpha Beta Stores Inc. 
22/wsj_2283:Under federal antitrust law, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have the authority to ask a federal court to order the divestiture of a merger that has been completed but has been found to be anticompetitive. 
22/wsj_2283:Federal appeals courts, however, disagree whether federal courts have the authority to order the break up of completed mergers in such private antitrust lawsuits. 
22/wsj_2283:While the high court tries to resolve the disparate views of the appeals courts, American Stores remains under a temporary order to operate the two supermarket chains as separate businesses. 
22/wsj_2283:But when the tender offer was increased, Lucky's directors approved the merger and, in June 1988, American Stores' $2.5 billion purchase of Lucky Stores was completed. 
22/wsj_2283:A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled in March that the district court's order had the same effect as requiring divestiture of one chain by American Stores.

22/wsj_2283:The Bush administration, in a friend-of-the-court brief, said that the Constitution gives states broad flexibility to require that medical patients in permanent, vegetative conditions continue to receive artificial feeding and fluids.
22/wsj_2283:The brief, filed by Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, said the family of a Missouri woman in such a vegetative state doesn't have the constitutional right to insist the state cut off artificial feeding. 
22/wsj_2283:Moreover, the brief is critical of arguments for a constitutional right to privacy, saying any right for competent individuals to refuse medical treatment should be rooted in tradition and based on the 14th Amendment "due process" protection of "liberty," not on "abstract notions" of privacy, which the Constitution doesn't mention. 
22/wsj_2283:Organizations supporting the constitutional right to abortion filed a friend-of-the-court brief in two Supreme Court cases in behalf of an unprecedented number of groups.
22/wsj_2283:The brief, coordinated by the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood Federation of America, was filed in behalf of 274 groups, although many of them were small community religious organizations rather than national in membership.
22/wsj_2284:After a long day tending the searing, blackened furnaces of the Panzhihua Iron & Steel Co., Li Wankui would like to relax away from the factory.
22/wsj_2284:Nestled in the remote mountains of southern Sichuan province about 1,200 miles southwest of Beijing, it is virtually cut off from the rest of China.
22/wsj_2284:Factory officials estimate that more than 10% of the work force here is redundant, but layoffs aren't allowed.
22/wsj_2284:A muscular 38-year-old, he rises each morning at 6 a.m. to prepare for his shift. (He is entitled to one day off after each seven days of work.) 
22/wsj_2284:Throwing on sweat pants and a T-shirt, he pops downstairs to a food shop, one of dozens run by the factory in Panzhihua's residential area.
22/wsj_2284:Mr. Li, whose pay is the equivalent of about $80 a month, buys steamed buns and rice porridge for his family.
22/wsj_2284:At the gate of the factory, a huge sign greets Mr. Li and his co-workers: "Happily, happily come to work!" 
22/wsj_2284:At lunchtime, Mr. Li walks to one of the 59 cafeterias the factory operates.
22/wsj_2284:Scraps of meat and bones litter the bare concrete floor.
22/wsj_2284:For about 30 cents, Mr. Li buys a bowl of pork, vegetables and rice. 
22/wsj_2284:At the end of Mr. Li's workday, as a new shift prepares to take over, the factory's propaganda officials go to work.
22/wsj_2284:For half an hour they relate to groups of workers the latest news and views from the Communist Party.
22/wsj_2284:They read speeches from top leaders and slam U.S. sanctions on China imposed after the June 4 massacre of pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. "We want to make sure that workers have a correct opinion about events," says Yuan Changyong, the local Party chief. 
22/wsj_2284:Teams of officials track the contraceptive methods their workers employ and even chart menstrual cycles of female employees.
22/wsj_2284:They work by persuasion and coercion, alternating doses of propaganda with threats of financial penalties for "unplanned" second births. 
22/wsj_2284:Zhang Shanyun, one of Mr. Li's bosses, knows the system well.
22/wsj_2284:Whenever Mr. Zhang wants to return to his farm, he must fill out a form detailing what kind of birth-control device he and his wife will use.
22/wsj_2284:Most of the food comes to him via the factory, which buys 80 million tons of produce a year.
22/wsj_2284:The factory sells to workers at cost, which means prices are about 50% below what the handful of independent local merchants charge. 
22/wsj_2284:It turned out that few workers here in the hills of Sichuan had ever seen them, so the factory TV station ran a broadcast on the correct way to eat Guangdong crabs. 
22/wsj_2284:There are few prospects for upward mobility, and Mr. Li's daughter, seven-year-old Li Shu, is certain to toil at the factory too someday, as are more than 10,000 of the workers' children. 
22/wsj_2284:Li Shu is in the second grade at the Xiangyang Village Elementary School for Workers' Children, one of 31 schools subsidized by the factory at a cost of more than half a million dollars a year.
22/wsj_2284:But he concedes that the pressures of the all-powerful factory sometimes are tough to bear.
22/wsj_2284:Most evenings after the news, he leaves his wife in front of the TV set and wanders restlessly around his quiet neighborhood.
22/wsj_2284:The center, built and run by Panzhihua Iron & Steel, is the beginning and end of social life in this town. 
22/wsj_2284:Mr. Li walks upstairs to the center's second-floor library, a poorly lit room where he spends many hours leafing through a thin selection of state-controlled periodicals.
22/wsj_2284:He pulls out a newspaper: The Panzhihua Iron & Steel Co. Daily. "It's a good read," Mr. Li says. "Quite informative." Today's lead story: "Manager Zhao Inspects Operation of No. 4 Furnace." 
22/wsj_2284:Not surprisingly in this remote outpost, many of the single factory workers here fall in love with each other. "We have a very small social circle," says Ma Yongjian, the company secretary general. "A lot of the young workers end up getting married." To facilitate such productive arrangements, the factory organizes dances each night, often outdoors on a concrete promenade along the banks of the Jinshajiang River. 
22/wsj_2284:On this evening, the dancers seem reluctant, as a sour eight-piece band plods through a series of Chinese pop songs.
22/wsj_2284:Immediately, hundreds of couples leap to their feet and rush onto the floor, dancing their well-rehearsed three-step, cheek-to-cheek.
22/wsj_2284:The factory, one of Chairman Mao's oddest follies, dates to 1965.
22/wsj_2284:Like tens of thousands of others, Mr. Li was ordered to go to Panzhihua, in 1971. "I lived in a straw-and-mud house at the time," he says. "But I was happy to be here, to carry on the fight against the imperialists and the revisionists." Today the perceived threat has passed, but the factory is thriving. 
22/wsj_2284:The Li family could apply for permission to do so, but hasn't tried. "I expect I'll be in Panzhihua for the rest of my life," Mr. Li says. "The No. 1 high school is pretty good, and I have to think of my daughter's future." 
22/wsj_2284:When the opportunity finally arose, thousands of workers departed, including virtually all of the factory's college graduates and senior engineers. 
22/wsj_2284:Ma Zhijie, deputy general manager of the factory's trading department, wants his eight-year-old son to have broader horizons, and believes education is the best ticket out of Panzhihua.
22/wsj_2284:What the factory's workers know of the world comes filtered through the propaganda machine of official newspapers and television, as well as political study sessions.
22/wsj_2284:At one point, Mr. Li repeats the theme of a recent political study class and harangues his American visitor about U.S. sanctions against China. "The Chinese and American people have great warmth for each other," Mr. Li says, "but I must tell you frankly that I disagree with President Bush's policy toward China." 
22/wsj_2284:Many of these Americans were incensed by the killings in Beijing and denounced the Chinese government. "Well, I certainly didn't know any of that," Mr. Li says, and abruptly closes the conversation. 
22/wsj_2284:As Mr. Li begins his walk back home, he displays a slight limp, the result of a back injury.
22/wsj_2284:Mr. Zhong motions to the wriggling bundles. "These," he says, "are the future workers of Panzhihua Iron & Steel." 
22/wsj_2284:Four of Britain's biggest banks said they plan to sell jointly owned Yorkshire Bank Group in an auction that could raise between #850 million ($1.33 billion) and #1 billion ($1.57 billion). 
22/wsj_2284:National Westminster Bank PLC, Yorkshire Bank's biggest holder with a 40% stake, said it, Barclays PLC, Lloyds Bank PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC decided to sell the 250-branch U.K. bank after receiving "a number of approaches" from potential purchasers.
22/wsj_2284:Yorkshire Bank, which had pretax profit of #100.4 million and #3.19 billion in assets last year, has Britain's ninth-largest branch network.
22/wsj_2284:It is viewed by market analysts as a potential target for banks aiming to boost their U.K. presence prior to the 1992 development of a single market in financial services in the European Community.
22/wsj_2284:Analysts have said the bank could fetch a price of between 8.5 and 10 times pretax profit -- or between #850 million and #1 billion. 
22/wsj_2284:Bill Barron, a NatWest general manager, said the banks decided to push ahead with the sale despite yesterday's sharp stock-market fall in London because the decision was strategic and independent of market valuations. 
22/wsj_2284:The consortium-ownership arrangement, which dates from a financial reconstruction of Yorkshire Bank in 1911, is outmoded for the increasingly competitive U.K. market, analysts say.
22/wsj_2284:Barclays owns 32%, Lloyds owns 20% and Royal Bank of Scotland owns 8% of Yorkshire Bank. 
22/wsj_2285:The Fed allowed the key federal funds interest rate to dip to about 8 5/8% from its levels of just below 9% last week.
22/wsj_2285:Because the markets remained relatively calm, however, the Fed didn't have to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987. 
22/wsj_2285:"I view this morning's action as hand holding for the financial markets," said Steven Wood, an economist with Bank of America.
22/wsj_2285:In a brief comment before the speech, he said he was "surprised" that some people interpreted his recent comments in Moscow "as endeavoring to say something about current monetary or foreign exchange policies." While visiting Moscow last week, the Fed chairman had warned that "attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates" may be destabilizing -- a comment some interpreted as criticism of the Treasury's efforts to push down the dollar. 
22/wsj_2285:"I hope my colleagues at the Gosbank {the Soviet central bank} don't misinterpret anything I said today," the Fed chairman joked before beginning the prepared text of his speech. 
22/wsj_2285:The Fed's move to ease credit wasn't an aggressive one, but it did signal a clear change of policy from before the stock market's swoon.
22/wsj_2285:The administration also benefited from the expertise of Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber and Assistant Secretary David Mullins, two former Harvard professors who had headed up the Brady Commission's effort to investigate the 1987 crash.
22/wsj_2285:The two men studied the order imbalances in the stock markets and the level of stock index futures to determine what might happen Monday morning.
22/wsj_2285:Also, Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson and Wayne Angell, another member of the reserve board, had objected, in a vote made public Oct. 6, to the Treasury's efforts to push down the dollar by selling currency in foreign exchange markets. 
22/wsj_2285:Separately, David Ruder, who left the chairmanship of the Securities and Exchange Commission two weeks ago, says investors should view market volatility as a fact of modern market life. 
22/wsj_2285:"I do not regard the amount of the decline on Friday as unexpected or unlikely," he said in a telephone interview. "With the market being up to 2,700 or 2,800 and the existence of derivative products . . . one can expect volatility of the magnitude we had." 
22/wsj_2285:Mr. Ruder, now a professor at the Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago, also expressed concern about two pauses in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures pits after prices had fallen and circuit breakers kicked in.
22/wsj_2286:It isn't given much chance of passing, but its mere existence is cause for anxiety. 
22/wsj_2286:The U.S. and the world are not in need of new doubts about the future soundness of the dollar.
22/wsj_2286:Attempts in late September to drive the dollar down through central bank interventions were ill-timed, particularly since we now know that the dollar was then in the process of taking another dive relative to oil and other producer goods.
22/wsj_2286:But all that was a long time ago and politicians have a way of forgetting such things.
22/wsj_2286:The 1970s inflation yielded great benefits to some producer interests, including Arab sheiks, at the expense of the American middle class.
22/wsj_2286:It was a classic example of how inflation transfers income to the wealthy from the middle class.
22/wsj_2286:In some countries, Argentina for example, those interests have overwhelmed the government and what remains of a middle class. 
22/wsj_2286:It was only after Mr. Volcker killed inflation, at the cost of a sharp but brief recession, that growth and productivity started rising once more.
22/wsj_2286:Producers were forced by the discipline of sound money to slash away organizational fat and acquire more efficient equipment.
22/wsj_2286:Many corporate executives don't understand or don't want to understand that their own companies eventually become victims of such policies.
22/wsj_2286:That was reflected in the stagnant stock market of the 1970s.
22/wsj_2286:All of which explains why stock and foreign exchange markets get jittery when the Fed comes under political pressure.
22/wsj_2286:When it tightened up last spring, the price indexes fell and the economy began to pick up speed again, which is of course exactly counter to the "inflation-fuels-growth" theory. 
22/wsj_2287:LAC Minerals Ltd. said it agreed to buy 65% of Denver-based Bond International Gold Inc. for $10 a share, or $373.8 million. 
22/wsj_2287:The purchase helps LAC make up for a court decision earlier this year in which it lost a long legal battle with Toronto-based Corona Corp. for control of Canada's richest gold mine.
22/wsj_2287:The Bond International stake would roughly double LAC's gold production and substantially reduce its average cost of producing gold. 
22/wsj_2287:Bond International is expected to produce about 600,000 ounces of gold in the fiscal year ending June 30, of which roughly two-thirds would be attributable to LAC from the date the acquisition is completed.
22/wsj_2287:Last year, Bond International spent an average $204 to produce an ounce of gold at mines in North and South America and in Australia, significantly lower than LAC's own average cost of $260 an ounce.
22/wsj_2287:Analysts say the real jewel in the Bond International crown is its 83% stake in Chile's El Indio mine, which they say had production costs of below $100 an ounce. 
22/wsj_2288:Through Valhi and its affiliates, Mr. Simmons holds a 10.43% stake in the aerospace and electronics concern, and his plans concerning Lockheed have been the subject of much speculation among securities analysts. 
22/wsj_2288:In the Daily News story, Mr. Simmons was quoted as saying, among other things: "Actually, I wish I were out of Lockheed.
22/wsj_2288:Yesterday's statement by Valhi said the quotes "take out of context and paraphrase statements made by Mr. Simmons in jest at the conclusion of a lengthy interview." The true position is that Valhi and its affiliates, as they have said in public filings, "may increase, decrease or retain their Lockheed holdings" depending on a number of conditions. 
22/wsj_2288:Douglas R. Dowie, Daily News managing editor for news, said "the quotes in the Daily News were in context and were not in jest." The report of the interview, which was recorded, was "absolutely correct," he added. 
22/wsj_2289:At 1:30 p.m. Tokyo time, the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks was off 1.4%, or 482.39 points, to 34633.63.
22/wsj_2289:In the first 20 minutes of trading in the morning, the Nikkei index had fallen 611.62 points or 1.7%, as nervous investors sold large capital issues. 
22/wsj_2289:Said a Japanese equities trader at Jardine Flemings Securities Ltd., in Tokyo: "There is still a lot of weakness and nervousness in the market." 
22/wsj_2289:The announcement that a group of takeover bidders for UAL Corp. had failed to raise enough money to acquire the U.S. airline was one of the main factors that triggered the sell-off, analysts said. 
22/wsj_2289:How far share prices fall in other markets will depend to a great extent on how the Tokyo market reacts, analysts and investors said. "I'm hoping Japan holds tight," said Allen Wheat, head of trading at Bankers Trust Co. in London, before the Tokyo opening. "But if Japan is wobbly, London will probably take a beating." 
22/wsj_2289:The French market could be harder hit than the London market, European analysts said, because recent unmaterialized takeover speculation in Paris has left some blue-chip stocks poised for markdowns. "Paris has had an awful lot of froth in the past two weeks and so is probably going to be hit a bit worse than London," said David Band, chief executive officer of Barclays Bank PLC's Barclays de Zoete Wedd investment banking unit. 
22/wsj_2289:Analysts in Tokyo had said over the weekend that a drop is unavoidable, but they predicted that Japan's traditionally cautious institutional investors will keep things from spinning out of control. "The Tokyo market can't help but go down," said Hiroaki Hanao, deputy general manager of the equity department at Daiwa Securities Co. "But it won't be such a big crash." 
22/wsj_2289:The Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan appear to be eager to put out the fire before it spreads.
22/wsj_2289:Japanese newspapers reported Saturday that the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan view the plunge on Wall Street as a result of U.S. domestic concerns about financing acquisitions, not as a sign of weak economic fundamentals. 
22/wsj_2289:If the yen rebounds against the dollar, he said, there is less chance of an additional increase in interest rates, which could help stabilize Tokyo share prices. 
22/wsj_2289:Last Wednesday, the Bank of Japan raised the discount rate 0.5 percentage point to 3.75% to stem the dollar's rise.
22/wsj_2289:Of ficials said they were concerned that a weaker yen will contribute to greater inflation in Japan.
22/wsj_2289:Now, many look to Tokyo as a potential stabilizing factor because of its resilience and quick recovery following Black Monday.
22/wsj_2289:Trading volume has also fallen off in recent weeks. "A lot of the speculative fat has been trimmed," said one analyst. 
22/wsj_2289:Many Japanese funds, which closed their books at the end of September, now have huge cash positions. "There's still lots of idle money sitting around here," said Hiroshi Ohira, chief analyst at New Japan Securities Co., citing a frequently stated reason for Tokyo's strength. 
22/wsj_2289:Said another foreign stock analyst: "All the Japanese brokers will try to look for the positive aspects of this." 
22/wsj_2289:"It's not like the crash in October 1987, when there was lots of optimism," said Phillip Niem, research director in Hong Kong for British-based Hoare Govette Asia Ltd. "This time around there's lots of caution.
22/wsj_2289:This time around, government and market officials said, the territory's revamped equity market will remain open regardless of what happens in New York today. 
22/wsj_2289:London's stock market, already wheezing under stresses of its own, is also casting a nervous eye toward Tokyo and bracing for a shock. 
22/wsj_2289:Many London traders planned an allnight vigil on developments in the Tokyo market. "A lot of our guys will be sitting up all night at home, and a couple of our guys will be in the office overnight," said Mr. Wheat of Bankers Trust. 
22/wsj_2289:Authorities, including the Bank of England and the Securities Association, are gearing up in case a crisis wallops the London market.
22/wsj_2289:However, in an unusual public statement, the bank sought to play down any note of crisis.
22/wsj_2289:Even before Friday's New York nosedive, the London market had been facing heavy uncertainty because of worries over the British economy.
22/wsj_2289:Responding to the developments, the Financial Times 100-share index, which had been slightly higher most of the day, closed at 2233.9, down 3.9 points from Thursday. 
22/wsj_2289:The impending stock market troubles could pose a dilemma for already embattled Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
22/wsj_2289:But a rate cut could weaken the recently depressed pound, which late Friday staged a sharp rally against the dollar after news of the New York market sell-off. 
22/wsj_2289:This widely followed stock market forecaster achieved fame by predicting, in July 1987, the October crash of that year.
22/wsj_2289:"London will open lower {today} whether or not Tokyo opens lower," Mr. Thompson said in an interview. "Market makers will mark down prices so bears can't go short to them at too advantageous a price." By going short, a market pessimist sells borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back later at a profit. 
22/wsj_2289:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
22/wsj_2290:John W. Day, president of Allied-Signal Automotive and executive vice president of Allied-Signal Inc., has been named to the board of this bank holding company.
22/wsj_2291:Mr. Simmons, who holds 6.6 million shares, or a 10.43% stake, in Lockheed, added that he isn't at all interested in taking over the Calabasas, Calif., aerospace concern. "Not now and not ever," he told the newspaper. "Actually, I wish I were out of Lockheed.
22/wsj_2291:Lockheed's share price on the New York Stock Exchange has been propped up in recent weeks, despite disappointing earnings, because of Mr. Simmons's interest in the company.
22/wsj_2291:He said Mr. Simmons knows the arbitrage community "can be a detriment by driving the share price up." Mr. Lamb said if the arbitrageurs get confused, maybe they'll move out of the stock and leave more for Mr. Simmons to grab. 
22/wsj_2292:Vitro S.A. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Anchor Glass Container Corp. for $21.25 a share, or $265 million, in the largest takeover of an American company by a Mexican concern. 
22/wsj_2292:Yesterday's announcement of the accord culminated a two-month long battle for the Tampa, Fla., maker of bottles and other glass containers.
22/wsj_2292:Anchor had been fighting Vitro's earlier $20-a-share tender offer and agreed to the sweetened bid after a special committee of Anchor's board put the company on the block.
22/wsj_2292:Vitro, which already owns 1,430,000 Anchor shares, agreed to buy the remaining 12,470,000 shares outstanding through THR Corp., an indirect subsidiary of Vitro.
22/wsj_2292:The Monterrey, Mexico, conglomerate also confirmed a previous announcement that it would acquire closely held Latchford Glass Co. of Huntington Park, Calif., in a separate transaction expected to close at the same time as the completion of the Anchor takeover.
22/wsj_2292:The purchase price of the Latchford transaction wasn't disclosed. 
22/wsj_2292:Vitro said Security Pacific National Bank committed $139 million to finance the purchase of Anchor and an affiliate of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. committed $155 million in a bridge loan to finance the Anchor and Latchford acquisitions. 
22/wsj_2293:From the professional money manager to the big overseas currency player to the little guy with his IRA in a mutual fund, the bulletin from Wall Street came as a shock -- followed swiftly by a sickening recollection of the pattern played out in the '87 crash: a 100-point-plus plunge on a Friday, a weekend of worrying in between, and then disaster on Monday.
22/wsj_2293:"It's scaring the hell out of me," says Tom Loughlin, a systems analyst and small investor in Boston. 
22/wsj_2293:Moreover, this plunge came in a time of relatively benign economic conditions, raising the question of how the markets might react when a serious economic upset, such as a recession, is on the horizon. 
22/wsj_2293:There are many reasons to think that what appeared Friday is another species of bear, and a less vicious one.
22/wsj_2293:-- The levels of selling of U.S and foreign stocks in Asian and European markets, which open well before New York's.
22/wsj_2293:-- Whether the buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp., whose financing failure triggered Friday's free fall, can be put back together.
22/wsj_2293:-- The levels of early stock-index futures trading in Chicago.
22/wsj_2293:That market shut down early on Friday, leaving millions of dollars of sell orders unexecuted.
22/wsj_2293:On Black Monday, some funds sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stocks after being inundated with redemptions.
22/wsj_2293:The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures took only 15 minutes from the UAL announcement, at 2:54 p.m., to hit their first "circuit breaker," a 30-minute trading halt that kicks in when the futures drop the equivalent of 100 points on the Dow.
22/wsj_2293:At the stock market's 4 p.m. close, the Dow Jones Industrial average was withing 60 points of another circuit breaker.
22/wsj_2293:One Big Board specialist complains that the Friday futures halt, which was supposed to give the markets time to regain their equilibrium because futures prices are reported faster, was "ridiculous; anything artificial that gets in the way of this market is very hard to work with." Some traders fear circuit breakers hold the risk of making matters worse, especially if they should halt stock trading.
22/wsj_2293:There were also complaints that the specialists on the floor of the Big Board, who are charged with making markets in individual stocks, performed poorly during the plunge.
22/wsj_2293:One futures executive, Christopher Pedersen of Twenty-First Securities Corp., says the specialists "were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange." But James Maguire, chairman of Henderson Brothers Inc., a Big Board specialist, retorts: "It is easy to say the specialist isn't doing his job.
22/wsj_2293:One of the most puzzling aspects of Friday's drop was the speed with which the damage to UAL spilled over to other stocks.
22/wsj_2293:Market professionals say that major arbitragers and others such as hedge funds, which were heavily invested in UAL and highly leveraged, couldn't get any cash out of their UAL positions because trading halted.
22/wsj_2293:Once UAL were to reopen, such speculators faced the likelihood of margin calls -- demands from lenders to put up more cash for stock positions bought with borrowed funds.
22/wsj_2293:But then trading was halted because of order imbalances -- there were far more sellers than buyers.
22/wsj_2293:AMR, subject of a $120-a-share bid from Donald Trump, saw trading in its stock halted at $98.625 a share, down $.125, but was quoted in off-exchange trading at only $81.50.
22/wsj_2293:Paramount Communications Inc., the subject of takeover whispers, plunged $6.625 a share to $56.625.
22/wsj_2293:Shares of Hilton Hotels Corp., which has put itself up for sale, nosedived $21.50 to $85 a share. 
22/wsj_2293:Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management in Greenwich, Conn., said computer-aided "program traders are the reason we had the last crash, they're the reason we're having this crash, and they're why we'll have the next crash.
22/wsj_2293:They're a total outrage." Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, agrees that none of Friday's events by themselves added up to a 190-point decline. "Programs took it down.
22/wsj_2293:Many market professionals say it is still too soon to know whether it was program traders, per se, who were to blame, but they generally agree that the computerized trading programs that have now been embraced by an array of professional investors and money managers accounted for the speed of the drop.
22/wsj_2293:Michael Steinhardt, who only last Monday was threatening a takeover of USAir using his 8.4% stake as a club, says he wished he didn't own the stock when Friday's market left him with a $12.9 million paper loss. "This market is a mile wide and an inch deep," he says.
22/wsj_2293:But Mr. Steinhardt disputed that he had been a heavy seller of other stocks Friday to make up for the USAir losses. 
22/wsj_2293:Several big firms that do index arbitrage, in which traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures simultaneously to take advantage of price differentials, say they couldn't execute trades because they couldn't be sure of prices they would get on the stock exchange floor. 
22/wsj_2293:The speed of Friday's drop is likely to reinforce the perception of many small investors that the markets are even more of a casino and haven't devised a manner for comfortably handling the awesome forces that technology has heaped upon them.
22/wsj_2293:Despite two years of study, the marketplace remains one where ever-anxious large investors, haunted by memories of the 508-point plunge in 1987 and aided by powerful computers, can turn minor market upsets into major calamities in the space of a few hours. 
22/wsj_2293:Then it was House Budget Committee Chairman Daniel Rostenkowski threatening to eliminate the tax deductibility of interest for certain debt-financed takeovers.
22/wsj_2293:But market observers point out that long-term government bond interest rates, currently at 7.85%, are 2.5 percentage points lower than the level that prevailed in October 1987, when interest rates had been rising for most of the year. 
22/wsj_2293:In 1987, the average P-E ratio fell from a peak of more than 20 to about 13 just after the crash.
22/wsj_2293:Just last week a string of earnings disappointments unnerved some market participants.
22/wsj_2293:Another factor that has been dominating the thinking of many stock analysts is the current plight of the junk-bond market.
22/wsj_2293:Although UAL, the second-largest leveraged buy-out ever, was to have been financed with bank debt instead of junk bonds, its failure to obtain financing focused attention on the entire market for leveraged deals, underscoring just how dependent the entire market has become on junk bonds.
22/wsj_2293:Many stocks owe at least part of their market valuation to the perception that they could soon be the subject of a takeover or buy-out.
22/wsj_2293:Attention is focused on the so-called breakup value of the stock in the hands of an imagined acquirer who would buy the company at a big premium, perhaps planning to sell it piece by piece. 
22/wsj_2293:Takeover specialist Carl Icahn, whose 13.1% stake in USX Corp. lost $151.2 million in value on Friday, says the stock market's downturn may reflect the end of a speculative period that has generated many leveraged buy-outs that now face problems as a result of weakness in the junk-bond market. "While a number of LBOs are fine, there are also many where the cash flow cannot pay the interest, but {that} instead are based on the buyer selling divisions to a greater fool to pay off the debt," Mr. Icahn says. 
22/wsj_2293:However, Mario Gabelli, a takeover-stock investor, says that while some of the most speculative deals may now prove impossible to finance, "Companies are still going to buy companies around the world." 
22/wsj_2293:As on any day on Wall Street, there are plenty of people who think the market will go up, and plenty who predict a downturn. "My advice is to buy," says Elaine Garzarelli, a market-timing expert at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., who warned clients of danger just before the 1987 crash.
22/wsj_2293:And Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady says the market's drop Friday ought to be seen in the context of a 28.7% runup in the Dow since Jan. 1 of this year.
22/wsj_2293:Since the market hit a record level of 2791.41 on Monday, it has declined by 222.15 points, or 8%.
22/wsj_2293:Most of that occurred on Friday. 
22/wsj_2293:James Awad, president of BMI Capital Corp. in New York, says that despite the more favorable valuation levels, stocks could still tumble several hundred points in the event of a breakdown in "the internal structure of the market." 
22/wsj_2293:Many mutual funds have big cash reserves -- which they lacked in 1987 -- as a cushion against a possible cascade of telephone sell orders today.
22/wsj_2293:Fidelity, which was forced to sell $800 million of stocks in the 1987 crash, has quadrupled the cash level of the giant Magellan fund.
22/wsj_2293:The Boston firm says redemptions in stock funds since the Friday market drop have equaled less than 15% of those funds' total cash position of about $2 billion. 
22/wsj_2293:"Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around," says C. Bruce Johnstone, who runs Fidelity's $5 billion Equity-Income Fund. "This feels more like a one-shot deal -- people aren't panicking." 
22/wsj_2293:Liquidity also appears to be far healthier than it was in 1987, when a lack of it brought the financial system close to break-down.
22/wsj_2293:Over the weekend, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan phoned officials in the U.S. and abroad to reassure them that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system if needed to prevent a financial crisis.
22/wsj_2294:Carl N. Singer was named chairman of this communications and electronics equipment supplier, succeeding Louis H. Wolcott, who resigned from the board.
22/wsj_2294:Mr. Singer will continue in his current positions as chairman of Miami-based Fundamental Management Corp., Microdyne's largest stockholder, and chairman of Mineola, N.Y.-based Robeson Industries Corp. Robert P. Adelman, former president and chief executive officer of Rogers Group, was named to the Microdyne board slot vacated by Mr. Wolcott, who will continue with Microdyne as an assistant to the president. 
22/wsj_2295:If one thing was clear in the chaos of Friday's market sell-off, it was that the collapse of the buy-out of UAL Corp. set the whole thing off.
22/wsj_2295:As word spread Friday that many of the world's biggest banks had refused to participate in the $6.79 billion leveraged transaction, the financial markets assumed the worst: If the management of a blue-chip outfit like the parent of United Airlines can't get financing, then takeovers in general must be headed toward extinction.
22/wsj_2295:The market, already chastened by a number of leveraged buy-outs gone bad, responded in a flood of sell orders. 
22/wsj_2295:The buy-out of UAL by a group made up of management, the pilots union and British Airways PLC, ran into difficulty because of its own unique problems, they say.
22/wsj_2295:Banks didn't suddenly become unwilling to finance takeovers, they just didn't like the looks of this particular deal. 
22/wsj_2295:Specifically, the bankers said that UAL's management and advisers pushed too hard, trying to keep too much of the potential profit for themselves.
22/wsj_2295:The airline's top two officers, chief executive Stephen M. Wolf and chief financial officer John C. Pope, for example, would have made a total of more than $100 million on the buy-out through stock options they hold, even though their proposal called for them to put only $15 million of their own funds into the deal. 
22/wsj_2295:The banks also said they were worried that United's rosy projections of future income -- and therefore its ability to pay off the debt -- didn't adequately take into account the bumpy nature of the airline industry. 
22/wsj_2295:From a lender's point of view, "it's one of the worst big takeover proposals we've seen," said an official of First Chicago Corp., one of the banks asked to finance the buy-out, which notably didn't include junk bonds.
22/wsj_2295:Even so, banks such as First Chicago, which has a long history of ties to UAL, stretched their lending guidelines as far as possible in hopes of making the proposal work. "We really gave this thing nine looks," the First Chicago officer said. 
22/wsj_2295:It was the job of A.D. Frazier, First Chicago's commercial lending chief, to call the buy-out group and put the best possible face on the news. "We called them back and said if they needed us -- if it would make a difference -- we'd come in," another officer familiar with the matter said. 
22/wsj_2295:Of course, it wasn't even close.
22/wsj_2295:But prospects of quickly putting together a new deal appeared bleak.
22/wsj_2295:"We've got a lot of homework to do, a lot of work ahead of us," said H. Bruce Bernstein, a lawyer at Sidley & Austin in Chicago, which is representing the bank group. 
22/wsj_2295:UAL was trading at $279.75 at the time of the halt and never reopened for trading Friday.
22/wsj_2295:At 3:30, with the market now in a free fall, representatives of the buy-out group scrambled to a hastily called meeting at Citicorp's offices at 399 Park Avenue in New York.
22/wsj_2295:The meeting itself, held in the corporate finance department on the ninth floor, was disorganized, as members of Citicorp's and Chase's syndication departments called other banks trying to figure out why they had rejected the deal.
22/wsj_2295:Gathered around a long table that filled the huge conference room were about 30 people, including representatives of Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, United Airlines, British Airways, Lazard Freres & Co., Salomon Brothers Inc., Skadden Arps (Mr.
22/wsj_2295:As they met to review what had gone wrong, the buy-out group quickly discovered that one of the big roadblocks had been Japanese lenders.
22/wsj_2295:Although they had provided the lion's share of the financing on the Northwest Airlines buy-out just a few months before, Japanese banks had said no to UAL. 
22/wsj_2295:The Japanese apparently balked at several aspects of the proposal.
22/wsj_2295:A senior executive at one of Japan's biggest banks says the UAL deal "was stretched.
22/wsj_2295:Japanese lenders also recently have grown more conservative toward highly leveraged transactions, partly because of the recent cash-squeeze at Canada's Campeau Corp. following its leveraged purchase of Federated Department Stores Inc. last year.
22/wsj_2295:Japanese banks are worried that the government might issue restrictive guidelines unless the banks hold down the number of risky leveraged-buy-out loans they make, says a Japanese monetary official. "So, they are very cautious," he says. 
22/wsj_2295:The Japanese banks were reminded of the labor tensions at UAL all last week.
22/wsj_2295:Machinists union leader John Peterpaul also made the union's views known in telephone conversations with representatives of Mitsubishi Bank, one of the Japanese banks that was considering participating in the financing.
22/wsj_2295:In those conversations, he reiterated the union's position that it would seek significant wage increases in the round of contract talks set to begin next month. 
22/wsj_2295:As the Thursday afternoon deadline for banks neared, some lending officers at First Chicago remained in favor of joining the financing group, but the bank's "credit police" were opposed, citing the high degree of risk associated with the loan.
22/wsj_2295:A vote of top officers, including Chairman Barry F. Sullivan, Thursday morning was strongly against the loan. 
22/wsj_2295:One official close to the transaction said banks were worried about the amount of assets the buy-out group had to cover the loans.
22/wsj_2295:He said in the NWA Inc. acquisition, banks were secured with well over $1 in assets for every $1 of loan exposure.
22/wsj_2295:In the UAL transaction, however, a banker's loans would have been secured with less than $1 in assets for every dollar of loans. 
22/wsj_2295:Another problem: The buy-out group's financial projections didn't assume any type of recession in the near future.
22/wsj_2295:It estimated that yields -- the amount of income the airline takes in on ticket sales -- would increase an average of 3.5% a year, despite the ups and downs the industry has suffered in the last 10 years. 
22/wsj_2295:The projections also assumed that load factors -- the number of seats filled per aircraft -- would remain a stable 66.7% or thereabouts, even though domestic travel has been weakening. 
22/wsj_2295:According to a machinists union analysis of the transaction that will be presented to the Department of Transportation and a House Aviation subcommittee later this week, a "mild recession" would result in the company's taking in $3.5 billion less cash in the next four years than forecast by the buy-out group. 
22/wsj_2295:The two New York banks have already been paid combined fees of $8 million for the commitments. 
22/wsj_2295:Citicorp and Chase told the buy-out group they were "highly confident" they could raise the remaining $4.2 billion needed to finance the deal. (The $7.2 billion the banks said they needed includes some refinancing of existing debt, and is therefore greater than the $6.79 billion offered for UAL.) Citibank's confidence was bolstered as recently as 10 days ago when representatives of 120 banks that had expressed interest in the UAL transaction attended a meeting with Citibank representatives. "Ninety percent of the questions asked were friendly," said a person who attended. "There were a lot of indications both before and after that this was a deal people thought well of." 
22/wsj_2295:The recent buy-out financing of NWA, Northwest Airlines' parent, for instance, was a much more collaborative effort among several U.S. banks.
22/wsj_2295:"Perhaps lenders are finally recognizing that the stream of airline cash flow may be less predictable and a higher risk than previously considered," said Karen Firestone, a money manager at Fidelity Investments in Boston. 
22/wsj_2295:It's kind of like, what's wrong with this picture?" 
22/wsj_2295:Fees paid to the banks, set at about 1.5% of loans, are low compared with other buy-outs, which have paid 2% to 2.5%.
22/wsj_2295:Because buy-out loans often get refinanced -- and thus paid off -- ahead of schedule, banks can't count on years of interest income from these loans.
22/wsj_2295:What's more, fees in the UAL proposal weren't structured to encourage banks to commit to lending large amounts of money. 
22/wsj_2295:And bankers were concerned that there weren't any junk bondholders or other buyers of subordinated debt standing between potential losses and the banks' senior loans. "Most of these leveraged deals have been done with a pretty heavy layer of junk," a First Chicago executive said. "This one has zippo." 
22/wsj_2296:The dollar's fall on Friday could signal a new bout of weakness for the U.S. currency and -- if it declines much further -- possibly the end of the U.S. currency's long-term climb that began in early 1988. 
22/wsj_2296:"The entire sentiment has changed; the dollar bulls definitely have been shaken," says Jack Kessler, senior vice president in charge of New York foreign-exchange operations for Chase Manhattan Bank. 
22/wsj_2296:He and others cite Friday's plunge in U.S. stock prices and the narrowing difference between interest rates in the U.S. and some of its major trading partners, particularly West Germany and Japan.
22/wsj_2296:In Tokyo Monday, the dollar opened for trading at 139.30 yen, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 144 yen, and 1.8340 marks down from Friday's close of 1.8720.
22/wsj_2296:"If the stock market keeps going down on Monday, you're going to see a lot of people selling dollars," says Robert Fio Rito, a trader at Harris Trust & Savings Bank in Chicago.
22/wsj_2296:In the short-run, the dollar's fate depends largely on the performance of the U.S. stock market today as well as the Fed's and other central banks' reaction to what happens in all world equity markets, say traders and analysts. 
22/wsj_2296:Not only does the dollar play a key role in determining the direction and health of the U.S. economy, but the speed with which it rises or falls is also of major concern to U.S. and foreign policy makers. 
22/wsj_2296:A precipitous fall by the dollar could reignite U.S. inflationary pressures by raising the price of imports and prompting U.S. manufacturers to increase domestic prices. 
22/wsj_2296:That's because a weaker dollar makes U.S. exports less expensive while raising the price of imports to American consumers. 
22/wsj_2296:If foreigners dump U.S. stocks and return to the safety of their home markets -- as they did in October 1987 -- they must simultaneously also sell dollars for their own currencies.
22/wsj_2296:Traders concluded that U.S. interest rates would remain firm, and the dollar quickly climbed to its intraday highs of 1.9140 marks and 144.80 yen. 
22/wsj_2296:But the rally quickly fizzled under the weight of trader chagrin that the currency hadn't risen further, profit-taking and unconfirmed reports that the Fed was selling dollars. 
22/wsj_2296:"The decline of the dollar was more a function of market makers dragging bids down than people massively selling," adds Richard Witten, vice president in charge of foreign-exchange operations at Goldman, Sachs & Co. 
22/wsj_2296:Currently, the dollar stands close to the upper limits of its so-called Louvre trading ranges of 1.70-to-1.90 marks and 120-140 yen, within which most traders and economists believe the Group of Seven major industrial countries have tried to keep it since February 1987.
22/wsj_2296:"For all of its unfortunate aspects, Friday's events make it easier for the G-7 process to continue," says Robert Feldman, an international economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. 
22/wsj_2296:He added:"Until Friday morning, market people were contending that further interest-rate hikes were necessary to keep the dollar bulls from running over {the central banks}; there seemed to be a sense of the dollar bulls coming back and taking control again." 
22/wsj_2296:In the past week and a half, major European countries -- led by West Germany and Japan -- raised official domestic interest rates, mostly to keep their currencies from falling further and to stem the inflationary impact of those declines. 
22/wsj_2296:Some of that already began on Friday. "Many of the banks in the U.S. called their counterparts in the Far East and Europe," says Chase Manhattan's Mr. Kessler. 
22/wsj_2296:Salomon Brothers' Mr. Feldman says that further evidence of foreign selling was the dollar's plunge Friday at the same time the bond market was rallying -- which hasn't occurred in months. "That may be a signal of a turning point in the strategies of international portfolio managers," he says. 
22/wsj_2296:He says that based on the price of a similar basket of goods and services in major industrial countries, the dollar currently "is very cheap." That, he says, "should increase the demand for dollars" by investors who want to buy real U.S. assets, such as real estate and companies. 
22/wsj_2296:Dollar doubters point to the prospects of a bumpy U.S. stock market at best, and the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates.
22/wsj_2296:In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at about $368.27 an ounce, up $2.81 an ounce from Saturday's close of $365.46. 
22/wsj_2297:ARBITRAGE: Technically, the simultaneous buying and selling of related securities to take advantage of small differences in price.
22/wsj_2297:INDEX ARBITRAGE: The simultaneous trading in stock-index markets and the underlying groups of stocks to take advantage of temporary discrepancies in prices. 
22/wsj_2297:LEVERAGED BUY-OUT: The purchase of a company by a small group of investors financed largely by debt, often junk bonds. 
22/wsj_2297:An index option lets the investor buy or sell the "basket" of stocks represented by a stock-market index. 
22/wsj_2297:PORTFOLIO INSURANCE: A method of hedging a stock portfolio, usually by selling futures contracts on stock indexes when the market falls. 
22/wsj_2297:STOCK-INDEX FUTURES: Contracts for future delivery of an amount of cash based on an index of stock prices, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 index or the Major Market Index.
22/wsj_2297:A trader buying a December S&P 500 stock-index futures contract at a price of $200 today, for instance, would be agreeing to take delivery next month of 500 times that amount in cash, or $100,000.
22/wsj_2297:Futures on the MMI are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade.
22/wsj_2298:Stock-index futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and stock-index options trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange initially closed within a few minutes of each other Friday afternoon.
22/wsj_2298:And when trading in the Chicago Merc's stock-index futures had finally halted for the day as well, sell orders cascaded onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, adding to the rout. 
22/wsj_2298:What's more, in anticipation of the trading halts many traders -- worried about being unable to trade at lower prices -- sold futures and options contracts, thereby knocking prices still lower. 
22/wsj_2298:Fossett Corp., an options-trading firm, said last night that it is transferring all of its customer accounts to First Options of Chicago.
22/wsj_2298:Stephen Fossett, president and sole owner of the company, said that he was making the transfers as a result of a substantial cash squeeze stemming from numerous calls for cash and margin money on Friday by several stock-option and futures exchanges. "All of our obligations were met," Mr. Fossett said. 
22/wsj_2298:Although few other trading firms here or in New York appeared to be in immediate financial difficulty, Friday's volatility also underscored the need for exchanges in Chicago to hasten the common clearing of futures and options contracts, traders said. 
22/wsj_2298:The trading halts in futures and options may have done more harm than good," said Jeffrey Tabak, a partner in the investment firm of Miller Tabak Hirsch & Co., and a member of the presidential commission that recommended intermarket circuit breakers be adopted. 
22/wsj_2298:The S&P 500 index future that expires in December closed at 328.85, nearly five index points below the 333.65 closing price of the S&P 500 index itself, which is based on the value of the 500 stocks in the index. 
22/wsj_2298:The wide discount of the index futures price against the actual index may tempt program traders, who profit from price discrepancies between stocks and futures, to buy the relatively cheap futures and sell stocks, sending the stock market still lower.
22/wsj_2298:That selling could pull futures prices lower as well, triggering another round of program selling. 
22/wsj_2298:Traders emphasized, however, that the price relationship between stocks and futures could change substantially by this morning's start of trading, based on trading overnight in Japan, an influx of new orders or other events. 
22/wsj_2298:It reopened at 2:30 p.m., but traded freely for only 15 minutes before hitting its daily limit of 30 points below the previous day's close.
22/wsj_2298:Sporadic trading occurred at that level for the next half-hour until the contract's normal closing time of 3:15 p.m. 
22/wsj_2298:The CBOE said in a statement that "the interests of fair and orderly markets wouldn't be served by a resumption of trading." But some options traders said they were furious that they had been denied a chance to trade while other markets were open. 
22/wsj_2298:As much as 25% of the volume in S&P 500 futures on most days comes from CBOE traders hedging their risks in the options markets.
22/wsj_2298:As a result, one of the largest options-trading firms in the country offered to sell 1,000 S&P 500 contracts at the limit of 30 index points below the previous day's close, an S&P 500 futures trader said.
22/wsj_2298:That offer and others like it killed any chance of a late rally and drove down stock-index futures prices to the daily limit, the trader added. 
22/wsj_2298:The Major Market Index futures contract on the Chicago Board of Trade, traded much less actively, touched its daily limit of 50 points below the previous day's close several times Friday, but bounced back slightly and never halted trading. 
22/wsj_2298:To provide an added cash cushion to compensate for the increased price volatility in their markets, the Chicago Merc required traders to increase the margin, or amount of cash they put up to trade S&P 500 contracts, by one-third to $12,000 a contract from $9,000, effective this morning.
22/wsj_2298:The Board of Trade doubled margin requirements for the Major Market Index futures to $8,000 a contract. 
22/wsj_2298:Officials of the exchanges said they communicated well with each other and with government regulators during Fri day's sell-off, compared with the sense of chaos that prevailed at times on Black Monday two years ago.
22/wsj_2298:The Chicago Merc has begun limited cross-margining of stock-index futures accounts with the Options Clearing Corp., which processes all options trades for U.S. exchanges.
22/wsj_2298:Just such a cash squeeze two years ago, at a leading Wall Street firm that was facing duplicate margin calls for futures and options positions, led several studies of the markets to call for the coordinated margining of positions in different markets. 
22/wsj_2299:Take $10 out of your wallet.
22/wsj_2299:That's how much the collapse of Lincoln Savings & Loan will cost you and every other American.
22/wsj_2299:Back in June, we recounted how five U.S. Senators -- Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini and John McCain of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan -- intervened with regulators to ease up on Lincoln, whose risk-fraught loans were more worthy of a casino than a federally insured thrift. 
22/wsj_2299:Last Friday, Common Cause, a political-reform lobby, asked for a Senate Ethics Committee probe of the five Senators.
22/wsj_2299:Perhaps Common Cause has come to recognize that Congress is generally incapable of investigating itself. 
22/wsj_2299:Charles Keating Jr., the chairman of American Continental, Lincoln's parent company, needed the Senators' help in his running battle with federal regulators.
22/wsj_2299:He admits he made large contributions to each of them so they would "take up my cause." In one case, 57 Keating executives gave $66,100 to Senator Riegle at the same March 1987 fund-raiser.
22/wsj_2299:In April 1987, the Senators,, absent Mr. Riegle, asked to meet with Ed Gray, then head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and according to Mr. Gray, unsuccessfully pressed him to drop a key regulation detrimental to Lincoln -- "a clear subversion of the regulatory process." Senator McCain now calls the meeting "improper" and after several previous denials, Senator Cranston now admits the regulation probably came up.
22/wsj_2299:Senators Glenn, Riegle and McCain apparently stopped doing favors for Mr. Keating after that, but Senators Cranston and DeConcini persisted, intervening on behalf of Lincoln until just before its closure this year. 
22/wsj_2299:It now turns out that at least four of the five Senators may have been indebted to Mr. Keating far beyond mere campaign contributions: 
22/wsj_2299:-- The Arizona Republic reports that two of Senator DeConcini's top aides received more than $50 million in real-estate loans from Lincoln. 
22/wsj_2299:Some $43,000 was used for the Glenn Senate campaign -- a possible violation of federal election law. 
22/wsj_2299:The lack of attention to the Keating drama is astonishing in light of the magnitude of the savings-and-loan disaster.
22/wsj_2299:By contrast, the extensively covered HUD political scandals may cost the taxpayers $2.0 billion, the centerpiece being a $0.0003 billion check to James Watt, the legality of which seems to be uncontested. 
22/wsj_2299:Similarly, the spate of dubious prosecutions in finance obscures the seriousness of the allegations against Mr. Keating and his associates.
22/wsj_2299:This is not a matter of whispering "bunny." The 160-page civil suit filed against Mr. Keating last month by the Resolution Trust Corp., the vehicle for the S&L bailout, traces a clear thread.
22/wsj_2299:Money was taken into Lincoln, for example by selling $250 million in uninsured debentures near retirement communities, and allegedly taken out of the parent company by insiders, for example by the sale of their personal stock to the company's employee stock ownership plan.
22/wsj_2299:The case remains to be tested in court, of course, but if the allegations hold up the Senators were defending a classic scam. 
22/wsj_2299:The hearings begin tomorrow, and will focus on why thrift regulator M. Danny Wall, a former Senate staffer, overruled staff recommendations to close Lincoln and transferred regulatory oversight of Lincoln to Washington.
22/wsj_2299:It was Common Cause's demand last year for a House Ethics Committee probe of Speaker Jim Wright that prompted the committee to hire Richard Phelan as an outside counsel.
22/wsj_2299:Mr. Phelan found that Mr. Wright had improperly intervened with federal regulators on behalf of S&Ls, but the Ethics Committee disagreed, saying such actions were an integral part of a Member's job and it could not second-guess "the technique and personality of the legislator." If the Senate Ethics Committee chooses to investigate, it will be interesting to see if it reaches the same conclusion in the case of the five Senators. 
23/wsj_2300:But while the New York Stock Exchange didn't fall apart Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 190.58 points -- most of it in the final hour -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos. 
23/wsj_2300:The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again couldn't handle the selling pressure. 
23/wsj_2300:Big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock, traders say.
23/wsj_2300:Heavy selling of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures in Chicago relentlessly beat stocks downward. 
23/wsj_2300:Once again {the specialists} were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange," said Christopher Pedersen, senior vice president at Twenty-First Securities Corp. 
23/wsj_2300:Countered James Maguire, chairman of specialists Henderson Brothers Inc.: "It is easy to say the specialist isn't doing his job.
23/wsj_2300:Speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market." 
23/wsj_2300:Then in a lightning plunge, the Dow Jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year, chalking up a 190.58-point, or 6.9%, loss on the day in gargantuan trading volume.
23/wsj_2300:At the end of the day, 251.2 million shares were traded.
23/wsj_2300:Shares of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, were extremely active all day Friday, reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an employee-management group.
23/wsj_2300:Arbitragers couldn't dump their UAL stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every "rumor" stock they had.
23/wsj_2300:Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic "stop-loss" orders, which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels.
23/wsj_2300:Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals, including computer-guided program traders.
23/wsj_2300:Traders said most of their major institutional investors, on the other hand, sat tight. 
23/wsj_2300:Now, at 3:07, one of the market's post-crash "reforms" took hold as the S&P 500 futures contract had plunged 12 points, equivalent to around a 100-point drop in the Dow industrials.
23/wsj_2300:After the trading halt in the S&P 500 pit in Chicago, waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the Big Board, and specialists continued to notch prices down.
23/wsj_2300:Without the guidepost of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board.
23/wsj_2300:This confusion effectively halted one form of program trading, stock index arbitrage, that closely links the futures and stock markets, and has been blamed by some for the market's big swings. (In a stock-index arbitrage sell program, traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference.) 
23/wsj_2300:"When the airline information came through, it cracked every model we had for the marketplace," said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms. "We didn't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do." 
23/wsj_2300:At 3:30 p.m., at the end of the "cooling off" period, the average was down 114.76 points.
23/wsj_2300:He camped out at a high-tech nerve center on the floor of the Big Board, where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders. 
23/wsj_2300:But the build-up of S&P futures sell orders weighed on the market, and the link with stocks began to fray again. 
23/wsj_2300:At about 3:45, the S&P market careened to still another limit, of 30 points down, and trading was locked again.
23/wsj_2300:That's when George L. Ball, chairman of the Prudential Insurance Co. of America unit, took to the internal intercom system to declare that the plunge was only "mechanical." 
23/wsj_2300:At Merrill Lynch & Co., the nation's biggest brokerage firm, a news release was prepared headlined "Merrill Lynch Comments on Market Drop." The release cautioned that "there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October 1987" and that there are still "attractive investment opportunities" in the stock market. 
23/wsj_2300:However, Jeffrey B. Lane, president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said that Friday's plunge is "going to set back" relations with customers, "because it reinforces the concern of volatility.
23/wsj_2300:And I think a lot of people will harp on program trading.
23/wsj_2300:Jeffrey Yass of program trader Susquehanna Investment Group said 2,000 S&P contracts were for sale on the close, the equivalent of $330 million in stock.
23/wsj_2300:Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself.
23/wsj_2300:The Big Board's Mr. Grasso said, "Our systemic performance was good." But the exchange will "look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks.
23/wsj_2300:But specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987 crash, the "upstairs" firms -- big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during Friday's blood-letting.
23/wsj_2301:It's now the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, comprising Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and . . . oh yes, England, too. 
23/wsj_2302:Ports of Call Inc. reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that weren't disclosed. 
23/wsj_2302:The agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring.
23/wsj_2302:The company said a portion of the $32 million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended air-charter operations. 
23/wsj_2302:Earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of Boeing Co. 707s because of increasing maintenance costs. 
23/wsj_2303:A consortium of private investors operating as LJH Funding Co. said it has made a $409 million cash bid for most of L.J. Hooker Corp. 's real-estate and shopping-center holdings. 
23/wsj_2303:The $409 million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $300 million in secured liabilities on those properties, according to those making the bid. 
23/wsj_2303:The group is led by Jay Shidler, chief executive officer of Shidler Investment Corp. in Honolulu, and A. Boyd Simpson, chief executive of the Atlanta-based Simpson Organization Inc. Mr. Shidler's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $1 billion in assets; Mr. Simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of L.J. Hooker. 
23/wsj_2303:L.J. Hooker, based in Atlanta, is operating with protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
23/wsj_2303:Its parent company, Hooker Corp. of Sydney, Australia, is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator.
23/wsj_2303:Sanford Sigoloff, chief executive of L.J. Hooker, said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee. 
23/wsj_2303:The $409 million bid is estimated by Mr. Simpson as representing 75% of the value of all Hooker real-estate holdings in the U.S.
23/wsj_2303:The consortium was put together by Hoare Govett, the London-based investment banking company that is a subsidiary of Security Pacific Corp. "We don't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid," said Allan Campbell, the head of mergers and acquisitions at Hoare Govett, in an interview.
23/wsj_2303:Eventually Mr. Simpson and Mr. Herscu had a falling out over the direction of the company, and Mr. Simpson said he resigned in 1988.
23/wsj_2303:In addition, Robert Sakowitz, chief executive of the Sakowitz chain, is seeking funds to buy out the Hooker interest in his company.
23/wsj_2304:Canadian steel-ingot production totaled 291,890 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 7, up 14.8% from the preceding week's total of 254,280 tons, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said. 
23/wsj_2305:The Treasury plans to raise $175 million in new cash Thursday by selling about $9.75 billion of 52-week bills and redeeming $9.58 billion of maturing bills. 
23/wsj_2305:They will be available in minimum denominations of $10,000. 
23/wsj_2306:As small investors peppered their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend, big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals: cash. 
23/wsj_2306:At Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund company, telephone volume was up sharply, but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding Black Monday in 1987.
23/wsj_2306:As of yesterday afternoon, the redemptions represented less than 15% of the total cash position of about $2 billion of Fidelity's stock funds. 
23/wsj_2306:"Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around," said C. Bruce Johnstone, who runs Fidelity Investments' $5 billion Equity-Income Fund. "This feels more like a one-shot deal.
23/wsj_2306:Mario Gabelli, for instance, holds cash positions well above 20% in several of his funds.
23/wsj_2306:Even Peter Lynch, manager of Fidelity's $12.7 billion Magellan Fund, the nation's largest stock fund, built up cash to 7% or $850 million.
23/wsj_2306:One reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions, the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in August and September. 
23/wsj_2306:Not all funds have raised cash levels, of course.
23/wsj_2306:As a group, stock funds held 10.2% of assets in cash as of August, the latest figures available from the Investment Company Institute.
23/wsj_2306:That was modestly higher than the 8.8% and 9.2% levels in August and September of 1987.
23/wsj_2306:But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around, fund managers said.
23/wsj_2306:A major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday.
23/wsj_2306:"There's not nearly as much froth," said John Bogle, chairman of Vanguard Group Inc., a big Valley Forge, Pa., fund company. 
23/wsj_2306:Vincent Bajakian, manager of the $1.8 billion Wellington Fund, added to his positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb, Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday.
23/wsj_2306:If the market drops further today, he said he'll be buying blue chips such as Bristol-Myers and Kellogg. "If they croak stocks like that," he said, it presents an opportunity that is "the kind of thing you dream about." 
23/wsj_2306:In addition, East Coast centers will open at 7:30 EDT this morning, instead of the normal 8:30. 
23/wsj_2306:T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests.
23/wsj_2306:Stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of 25% through September, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. 
23/wsj_2306:Nevertheless, Ms. Garzarelli said she was swamped with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders. "Half of them are really scared and want to sell," she said, "but I'm trying to talk them out of it." She added, "If they all were bullish, I'd really be upset." 
23/wsj_2306:The backdrop to Friday's slide was markedly different from that of the October 1987 crash, fund managers argue.
23/wsj_2306:"From the investors' standpoint, institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson . . . by selling at the lows" on Black Monday, said Stephen Boesel, manager of the $580 million T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund.
23/wsj_2307:Newport Corp. said it expects to report fiscal-first-quarter earnings of between 15 cents and 19 cents a share, somewhat below analysts' estimates of 19 cents to 23 cents. 
23/wsj_2307:The maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said orders fell below expectations in recent months. 
23/wsj_2307:A spokesman added that sales in the current quarter will about equal the yearearlier quarter's figure, when Newport reported net income of $1.7 million, or 21 cents a share, on $14.1 million in sales. 
23/wsj_2308:Ripples from the strike by 55,000 Machinists union members against Boeing Co. reached air carriers Friday as America West Airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of Houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the Seattle jet maker. 
23/wsj_2308:Peter Otradovec, vice president for planning at the Phoenix, Ariz., carrier, said in an interview that the work stoppage at Boeing, now entering its 13th day, "has caused some turmoil in our scheduling" and that more than 500 passengers who were booked to fly out of Houston on America West would now be put on other airlines. 
23/wsj_2308:Nevertheless, the company's reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge manufacturer such as Boeing can have on other parts of the economy.
23/wsj_2308:"I just don't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout," Tom Baker, president of Machinists' District 751, said in an interview yesterday. "I don't think their customers would like it very much." 
23/wsj_2308:America West, though, is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be. "I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets, they might not miss one at all," Mr. Otradovec said. 
23/wsj_2308:Indeed, a random check Friday didn't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations.
23/wsj_2308:Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time. "It's so close to completion, Boeing's told us there won't be a problem," said a Southwest spokesman. 
23/wsj_2308:American is preparing to take delivery of another 757 in early December and 20 more next year and isn't anticipating any changes in that timetable. 
23/wsj_2308:In Seattle, a Boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike. 
23/wsj_2308:As of Friday, four had been delivered and a fifth plane, a 747-400, was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to Air China. 
23/wsj_2308:Though Boeing's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday, it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders. "The market has taken two views: that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term," said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. Boeing's shares fell $4 Friday to close at $57.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
23/wsj_2308:But Mr. Baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month, hinting that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week.
23/wsj_2308:Last week, Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz sent striking workers a letter, saying that "to my knowledge, Boeing's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major U.S. industrial firm in recent history." 
23/wsj_2308:But Mr. Baker called the letter -- and the company's offer of a 10% wage increase over the life of the pact, plus bonuses -- "very weak." He added that the company miscalculated the union's resolve and the workers' disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime. 
23/wsj_2308:-- And Boeing on Friday said it received an order from Martinair Holland for four model 767-300 wide-body jetliners valued at a total of about $326 million. 
23/wsj_2308:The planes, long range versions of the medium-haul twin-jet, will be delivered with Pratt & Whitney PW4060 engines.
23/wsj_2308:Pratt & Whitney is a unit of United Technologies Inc. Martinair Holland is based in Amsterdam. 
23/wsj_2308:A Boeing spokeswoman said a delivery date for the planes is still being worked out "for a variety of reasons, but not because of the strike." 
23/wsj_2309:C.S. Richardson, Atco's senior vice president, finance, said its 50.1%-owned Canadian Utilities Ltd. unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern Canada, and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere, including Britain, where the British government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program. 
23/wsj_2309:They can be C$1 billion plus," Mr. Richardson said. "But we wouldn't go into them alone," and Canadian Utilities' equity stake would be small, he said. "Ideally, we'd like to be the operator {of the project} and a modest equity investor.
23/wsj_2309:Britain's government plans to raise about #20 billion ($31.05 billion) from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities, beginning next month.
23/wsj_2309:Under terms of the plan, independent generators would be able to compete for 15% of customers until 1994, and for another 10% between 1994 and 1998. 
23/wsj_2309:Canadian Utilities had 1988 revenue of C$1.16 billion, mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in Alberta, where the company serves about 800,000 customers. 
23/wsj_2309:"There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity," Mr. Richardson said, and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it. "This is a real thrust on our utility side," he said, adding that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries, though he would be specific. 
23/wsj_2309:Canadian Utilities isn't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in Britain, in anticipation of the privatization program. "We're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England," said Bruce Stram, vice president, corporate strategy and corporate planning, with Enron Corp., Houston, a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator. 
23/wsj_2309:Mr. Stram said Enron is considering building gas-fired power plants in the U.K. capable of producing about 500 megawatts of power at a cost of about $300 million to $400 million. 
23/wsj_2310:PSE Inc. said it expects to report third earnings of $1.3 million to $1.7 million, or 14 cents to 18 cents a share. 
23/wsj_2310:In the year-ago quarter, the designer and operator of cogeneration and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $326,000, or four cents a share, on revenue of about $41.4 million.
23/wsj_2312:The well flowed at a rate of 2.016 million cubic feet of gas a day through a 16/ 64-inch opening at depths between 5,782 and 5,824 feet. 
23/wsj_2313:The partnership, Kaufman & Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership, is a 50-50 joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of Heitman Advisory Corp., a unit of Heitman Financial Corp., a real estate advisory, management and development company with offices in Chicago and Beverly Hills, Calif.
23/wsj_2313:The land to be purchased by the joint venture hasn't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development, and part of Kaufman & Broad's job will be to obtain such approvals. 
23/wsj_2313:The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development, but in return, it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices, which can result in sizable savings, said Bruce Karatz, president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad. 
23/wsj_2313:Typically, developers option property, and then once they get the administrative approvals, they buy it," said Mr. Karatz, adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind. "We usually operate in that conservative manner." 
23/wsj_2313:By setting up the joint venture, Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land, while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet, Mr. Karatz said.
23/wsj_2313:The company is putting up only 10% of the capital, although it is responsible for providing management, planning and processing services to the joint venture. 
23/wsj_2313:"This is one of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company," Mr. Karatz said. 
23/wsj_2314:When the price of plastics took off in 1987, Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride. 
23/wsj_2314:The timing of Quantum's chief executive officer, John Hoyt Stookey, appeared to be nothing less than inspired, because he had just increased Quantum's reliance on plastics.
23/wsj_2314:The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years.
23/wsj_2314:Mr. Stookey said of the boom, "It's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks." 
23/wsj_2314:Some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter, compared with year-earlier profit of $99.8 million, or $3.92 a share, on sales of $724.4 million.
23/wsj_2314:The stock, having lost nearly a quarter of its value since Sept. 1, closed at $34.375 share, down $1.125, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday. 
23/wsj_2314:To a degree, Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that pervade modern life.
23/wsj_2314:Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history, these producers now see their prices eroding. 
23/wsj_2314:And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them. "We were all wonderful heroes last year," says an executive at one of Quantum's competitors. "Now we're at the bottom of the heap." 
23/wsj_2314:Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp., the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive's job in 1986.
23/wsj_2314:Mr. Stookey, 59 years old, declined to be interviewed for this article, but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- Quantum will prosper through its new direction. 
23/wsj_2314:When the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound, Quantum's annual profit fluctuates by about 85 cents a share, provided no other variables are changing.
23/wsj_2314:In recent months the price of polyethylene, even more than that of other commodity plastics, has taken a dive.
23/wsj_2314:Meanwhile, the price of ethylene, the chemical building block of polyethylene, hasn't dropped nearly so fast.
23/wsj_2314:That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly, because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs. 
23/wsj_2314:By many accounts, an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year.
23/wsj_2314:Kenneth Mitchell, director of Dow's polyethylene business, says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up. "People were even hoarding bags," he says. 
23/wsj_2314:They recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks.
23/wsj_2314:Noting others' estimates of when price increases can be sustained, he remarks, "Some say October.
23/wsj_2314:At the same time, its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $240 million, largely because of debt taken on to pay a $50-a-share special dividend earlier this year. 
23/wsj_2314:Whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend, raised 36% to 75 cents a share only a year ago, has become a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street since Mr. Stookey deflected dividend questions in a Sept. 29 meeting with analysts. 
23/wsj_2314:In any case, on the day of the meeting, Quantum's shares slid $2.625 to $36.625 in Big Board trading. 
23/wsj_2314:On top of everything else, Quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in Morris, Ill.
23/wsj_2314:After an explosion idled the plant in June, the company progressed in September to within 12 hours of completing the drawn-out process of restarting it.
23/wsj_2314:"You say you could have sold X percent of this product and Y percent of that," recalls Theodore Semegran, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer. "And then you still have to negotiate." 
23/wsj_2314:The plant usually accounts for 20% to 25% of Quantum's polyethylene production and 50% of its ethylene production. 
23/wsj_2314:Through a venture with its investment banker, First Boston Corp., Quantum completed in August an acquisition of Petrolane Inc. in a transaction valued at $1.18 billion.
23/wsj_2314:Asked about a bid for Quantum, a BP spokesman says, "We pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors, and I think that falls in that category." 
23/wsj_2315:RJR Nabisco Inc. is disbanding its division responsible for buying network advertising time, just a month after moving 11 of the group's 14 employees to New York from Atlanta. 
23/wsj_2315:"We found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost," said the spokesman, who declined to specify how much RJR spends on network television time.
23/wsj_2315:One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because "there was supposed to be a future." He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks, wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies. 
23/wsj_2315:The RJR spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks' upcoming season. "The studies {on closing the unit} couldn't be completed until now," he said. 
23/wsj_2316:The U.S., which is finalizing its steel-import quotas, is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries. 
23/wsj_2316:Brazil, similar to Mexico and South Korea, is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas, which expired Sept. 30.
23/wsj_2316:In recent years, U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80% of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation.
23/wsj_2316:Of the remaining 20% needed, the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15% to foreign suppliers, with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which isn't included in the quota program.
23/wsj_2316:Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. that are similar to quotas. 
23/wsj_2316:Mexico, which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the U.S., virtually doubled its quota to 0.95% of the U.S. steel market from 0.48% under the previous quotas.
23/wsj_2316:That increase rises to slightly more than 2% of the U.S. market if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included.
23/wsj_2316:The EC steel industry, which has been coping with strong European demand, has been supplying about 5% of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%.
23/wsj_2316:Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5% of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9%. 
23/wsj_2316:In the recent talks, the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons, to 7% of the U.S. market from 6.7% in 1988.
23/wsj_2316:Japan, the EC, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea provide about 80% of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program.
23/wsj_2316:The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters, such as Australia and Venezuela. 
23/wsj_2316:The U.S. had about an extra 2% of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks.
23/wsj_2316:That was essentially made up of a 1% increase in the overall quota program and 1% from cutting Japan's allowance. 
23/wsj_2316:Negotiators from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1% of the U.S. steel market to allocate. 
23/wsj_2317:Elcotel, a telecommunications company, had net income of $272,000, or five cents a share, in its year-earlier second quarter, ended Sept. 30.
23/wsj_2317:George Pierce, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $4 million. 
23/wsj_2317:The lower results, Mr. Pierce said, reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones, Elcotel's primary business.
23/wsj_2317:Although Mr. Pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year, he said Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas. 
23/wsj_2317:Mr. Pierce said Elcotel should realize a minimum of $10 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month. 
23/wsj_2317:Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls.
23/wsj_2317:The company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones, which don't accept coins, for use in hotel lobbies, office lobbies, hospitality lounges and similar settings. 
23/wsj_2317:Mr. Pierce estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $5 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month. 
23/wsj_2319:Quest Medical Inc. said it adopted a shareholders' rights plan in which rights to purchase shares of common stock will be distributed as a dividend to shareholders of record as of Oct. 23. 
23/wsj_2319:The company said the plan wasn't adopted in response to any known offers for Quest, a maker and marketer of hospital products. 
23/wsj_2319:The rights allow shareholders to purchase Quest stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than 15% of the company's common stock or announces a tender offer. 
23/wsj_2320:The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack.
23/wsj_2320:When Attack hit the shelves in 1987, P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%.
23/wsj_2320:With the help of Lemon Cheer, P&G's share is now estimated to be 12%. 
23/wsj_2320:While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products, the true test for P&G will be in the $4 billion U.S. detergent market, where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders.
23/wsj_2320:With superconcentrates, however, it isn't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine, believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry. 
23/wsj_2320:To be sure, Kao wouldn't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G, which has about 23% of the market. 
23/wsj_2320:Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S., but so far the company has focused on acquisitions, such as last year's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co., a Cincinnati hand-lotion maker.
23/wsj_2321:They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. 
23/wsj_2321:Instead, they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view.
23/wsj_2321:But Mrs. Hills, speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday, stressed that the objective "is not to get definitive action by spring or summer, it is rather to have a blueprint for action." She added that she expected "perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we're moving in earnest." 
23/wsj_2321:Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand.
23/wsj_2321:And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade. 
23/wsj_2321:Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher's, Mrs. Hills replied: "I didn't hear every word he spoke, but as a general proposition, I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration." Yet more than one American official who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly "conciliatory." 
23/wsj_2321:"I think my line has been very consistent," Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon. "I am painted sometimes as ferocious, perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement.
23/wsj_2321:I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade." 
23/wsj_2321:When she met the local press for the first time on Friday, Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products, satellites and supercomputers, three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill.
23/wsj_2321:But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition.
23/wsj_2321:At her news conference for Japanese reporters, one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief. "My impression was that you would be a scary old lady," he said, drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues. "But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity." 
23/wsj_2321:The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10% for years.
23/wsj_2321:At one of her news conferences, Mrs. Hills said, "I believe we can do much better than 20%." But she stressed, "I am against managed trade.
23/wsj_2321:I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market." 
23/wsj_2322:The seller of photographic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives, including seeking increases in its credit lines. 
23/wsj_2322:Traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and wouldn't say if it expects to show a profit for the year.
23/wsj_2322:In the year ended June 30, 1988, Traditional reported net income of $4.9 million, or $1.21 a share.
23/wsj_2322:In the latest nine months net income was $4.7 million, or $1.31 a share, on revenue of $44.3 million. 
23/wsj_2322:Separately, the company said it would file a delayed fiscal-year report with the Securities and Exchange Commission "within approximately 45 days." It said the delay resulted from difficulties in resolving its accounting of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.
23/wsj_2323:Information International Inc. said it was sued by a buyer of its computerized newspaper-publishing system, alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system. 
23/wsj_2323:A spokesman for Information International said the lawsuit by two units of Morris Communications Corp. seeks restitution of the system's about $3 million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the Morris units to Information International for alleged failure to pay royalties. 
23/wsj_2324:Syms Corp. completed the sale of its A. Sulka & Co. subsidiary, a men's luxury haberdashery, to Luxco Investments. 
23/wsj_2324:As Syms's "core business of off-price retailing grows, a small subsidiary that is operationally unrelated becomes a difficult distraction," said Marcy Syms, president of the parent, in a statement. 
23/wsj_2324:A spokeswoman said Sulka operates a total of seven stores in the U.S. and overseas.
23/wsj_2325:The oil industry's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year. 
23/wsj_2325:The industry is "seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals," Glenn Cox, president of Phillips Petroleum Co., said in an interview. "That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings" for the industry in general, he added.
23/wsj_2325:Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene, a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies.
23/wsj_2325:Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker. "Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year," said William Randol, a securities analyst at First Boston Corp. 
23/wsj_2325:Refiners say margins picked up in September, and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter, though still not to the level of 1988's fourth quarter.
23/wsj_2325:Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies' earnings this year.
23/wsj_2325:"We've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices," said Mr. Cox, Phillips's president. "The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected." 
23/wsj_2326:The Bush administration, trying to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc, is questioning whether Italy's Ing.
23/wsj_2326:Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export-control policies, are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26.
23/wsj_2326:They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools, computers and other high-technology products. 
23/wsj_2326:The London Sunday Times, which first reported the U.S. concerns, cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported $25 million in "embargoed, state-of-the-art, flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry." Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984. 
23/wsj_2326:Although the legality of these sales is still an open question, the disclosure couldn't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community. "It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting," said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies. 
23/wsj_2326:Last summer, Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods.
23/wsj_2326:But more recently, the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc. 
23/wsj_2327:Salomon Brothers International Ltd., a British subsidiary of Salomon Inc., announced it will issue warrants on shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. 
23/wsj_2327:The move closely follows a similar offer by Salomon of warrants for shares of Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. 
23/wsj_2327:Under the latest offer, HK$62.5 million (US$8 million) of three-year warrants will be issued in London, each giving buyers the right to buy one Hong Kong Telecommunications share at a price to be determined Friday. 
23/wsj_2327:The 50 million warrants will be priced at HK$1.25 each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about 26%.
23/wsj_2327:In trading on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, the shares closed Wednesday at HK$4.80 each.
23/wsj_2327:Bankers said warrants for Hong Kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors, wary of volatility in the colony's stock market, an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk. 
23/wsj_2327:The Hong Kong Telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in Europe, the bankers added, because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the Hong Kong market that has international appeal. 
23/wsj_2328:Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara filed suit against former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., charging they defrauded the thrift by concealing their relationship when persuading it to buy $284 million in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. 
23/wsj_2328:In a suit filed in federal court Thursday, the S&L alleged that a "disproportionate number" of the bonds it purchased in 1984 declined in value.
23/wsj_2328:Financial Corp. said it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of Ivan F. Boesky Corp. visited it in November 1983 and said Financial Corp. could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds.
23/wsj_2328:Shortly before the visit, Mr. Boesky and Drexel representives had met with Financial Corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the 51% stake in the company.
23/wsj_2329:Ideal Basic Industries Inc. said its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for HOFI North America Inc. to combine its North American cement holdings with Ideal in a transaction that will leave Ideal's minority shareholders with 12.8% of the combined company. 
23/wsj_2329:HOFI, the North American holding company of Swiss concern Holderbank Financiere Glaris Ltd., previously proposed combining its 100% stake in St. Lawrence Cement Inc. and its 60% stake in Dundee Cement Co. with its 67% stake in Ideal. 
23/wsj_2329:But HOFI's first offer would have given Ideal's other shareholders about 10% of the combined company.
23/wsj_2329:Under the agreement, HOFI will own 87.2% of the combined company.
23/wsj_2329:Ideal's current operations will represent about 39.2% of the combined company. 
23/wsj_2330:While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought-induced peaks of 1988, wheat prices remain stubbornly high.
23/wsj_2330:And if rain doesn't fall soon across many of the Great Plains' wheat-growing areas, yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced, further squeezing supplies.
23/wsj_2330:By next May 31, stocks of U.S. wheat to be carried over into the next season -- before the winter wheat now being planted is harvested -- are projected to drop to 443 million bushels.
23/wsj_2330:Stocks were 698 million bushels on May 31 of this year. 
23/wsj_2330:In response to dwindling domestic supplies, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last month said the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments.
23/wsj_2330:But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted won't be felt until the second half of next year.
23/wsj_2330:On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday, wheat for December delivery settled at $4.0675 a bushel, unchanged. 
23/wsj_2330:Such a situation can wreak havoc, as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
23/wsj_2330:A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans.
23/wsj_2330:Unseasonably hot, dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat-growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season's winter wheat crop, said Conrad Leslie, a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago.
23/wsj_2330:For example, in the Oklahoma panhandle, 40% or more of the topsoil is short of moisture.
23/wsj_2330:That figure climbs to about 47% in wheat-growing portions of Kansas, he said. 
23/wsj_2330:The Soviet Union hasn't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans, but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months, further supporting prices. "Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand" in coming weeks, predicted Richard Feltes, vice president, research, for Refco Inc. in Chicago. 
23/wsj_2330:Late Thursday, after the close of trading, the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989-90 Florida orange crop.
23/wsj_2330:It was near the low range of estimates, at 130 million 90-pound boxes, compared with 146.6 million boxes last season. 
23/wsj_2330:However, as expected, Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $1.34 a pound from around $1.55.
23/wsj_2330:Friday's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time.
23/wsj_2330:It settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $1.3210 a pound. 
23/wsj_2330:Brazilian juice, after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season, is beginning to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities.
23/wsj_2330:The price cut, one analyst said, appeared to be aimed even more at Europe, where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen.
23/wsj_2330:Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas, downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January, when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak, the analyst said. 
23/wsj_2330:Although some analysts look for profit-taking in the wake of Friday's leap in crude oil prices, last week's rally is generally expected to continue this week. 
23/wsj_2330:Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets.
23/wsj_2330:On European markets, meanwhile, spot prices of North Sea crudes were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel. 
23/wsj_2330:Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes.
23/wsj_2330:Many traders foresee a tightening of near-term supplies, particularly of high-quality crudes such as those produced in the North Sea and in Nigeria. 
23/wsj_2331:Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of Friday's stock-market sell-off in New York and turmoil in the junk-bond market.
23/wsj_2331:But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant, which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi, has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks. 
23/wsj_2331:And Carl Spielvogel, chief executive officer of Saatchi's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit, said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company, but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi.
23/wsj_2331:Mr. Spielvogel isn't part of the board, nor are any of the other heads of Saatchi's big U.S.-based ad agencies. 
23/wsj_2331:The executive didn't name any price, but securities analysts have said Saatchi would fetch upward of $1.3 billion. 
23/wsj_2331:That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive, Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1.
23/wsj_2331:Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc., has a reputation as a savvy financial manager, and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi's poor financial state. 
23/wsj_2331:"It hasn't had any impact on us, nor do we expect it to," said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co., a major client of Backer Spielvogel.
23/wsj_2331:John Lampe, director of advertising at PaineWebber Inc., a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client, said: "We have no problem with the announcement, because we don't know what change it's going to bring about.
23/wsj_2331:We aren't going to change agencies because of a change in London." 
23/wsj_2331:Mr. Spielvogel had said that Prudential-Bache was prepared to finance either a management buy-out and restructuring, or a buy-out of Backer Spielvogel alone, led by him. 
23/wsj_2331:NEW ACCOUNT: California's Glendale Federal Bank awarded its $12 million to $15 million account to the Los Angeles office of Omnicom Group's BBDO agency.
23/wsj_2331:ACCOUNT REVIEW: Royal Crown Cola Co. has ended its relationship with the Boston office of Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos.
23/wsj_2332:Citing a payment from a supplier and strong sales of certain data-storage products, Maxtor Corp. said earnings and revenue jumped in its second quarter ended Sept. 24. 
23/wsj_2332:The maker of computer-data-storage products said net income rose to $4.8 million, or 23 cents a share, from year-earlier net of $1.1 million, or five cents a share.
23/wsj_2332:Maxtor said its results were boosted by $2 million in payments received from a supplier, for a certain line of products that Maxtor isn't going to sell anymore.
23/wsj_2332:A spokeswoman wouldn't elaborate, but the company said the discontinued product has never been a major source of revenue or profit. 
23/wsj_2332:Operationally, Maxtor benefited from robust sales of products that store data for high-end personal computers and computer workstations. 
23/wsj_2333:Robert G. Walden, 62 years old, was elected a director of this provider of advanced technology systems and services, increasing the board to eight members.
23/wsj_2333:He retired as senior vice president, finance and administration, and chief financial officer of the company Oct. 1. 
23/wsj_2334:Southmark Corp. said that it filed part of its 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that the filing doesn't include its audited financial statements and related information. 
23/wsj_2334:The real estate and thrift concern, operating under bankruptcy-law proceedings, said it told the SEC it couldn't provide financial statements by the end of its first extension "without unreasonable burden or expense." The company asked for a 15-day extension Sept. 30, when the financial reports were due. 
23/wsj_2335:Alan Seelenfreund, 52 years old, was named chairman of this processor of prescription claims, succeeding Thomas W. Field Jr., 55, who resigned last month.
23/wsj_2335:Mr. Field also had been chairman of McKesson Corp., resigning that post after a dispute with the board over corporate strategy.
23/wsj_2335:Mr. Seelenfreund is executive vice president and chief financial officer of McKesson and will continue in those roles.
23/wsj_2335:Malson and Seelenfreund are directors of McKesson, which has an 86% stake in PCS. 
23/wsj_2336:MedChem Products Inc. said a U.S. District Court in Boston ruled that a challenge by MedChem to the validity of a U.S. patent held by Pharmacia Inc. was "without merit." 
23/wsj_2336:A MedChem spokesman said the products contribute about a third of MedChem's sales and 10% to 20% of its earnings. 
23/wsj_2336:In the year ended Aug. 31, 1988, MedChem earned $2.9 million, or 72 cents a share, on sales of $17.4 million. 
23/wsj_2336:MedChem said the court's ruling was issued as part of a "first-phase trial" in the patent-infringement proceedings and concerns only one of its defenses in the case.
23/wsj_2336:It said it is considering "all of its options in light of the decision, including a possible appeal." The medical-products company added that it plans to "assert its other defenses" against Pharmacia's lawsuit, including the claim that it hasn't infringed on Pharmacia's patent. 
23/wsj_2337:In New York, the Bonwit Teller and B. Altman & Co. department stores have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, while the R.H. Macy & Co., Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue department-store chains are for sale. 
23/wsj_2337:All bets are off, analysts say, because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains. 
23/wsj_2337:"Improved paper prices will help offset weakness in linage, but the retailers' problems have affected the amount of ad linage they usually run," said Edward J. Atorino, industry analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. "Retailers are just in disarray." 
23/wsj_2337:For instance, Gannett Co. posted an 11% gain in net income, as total ad pages dropped at USA Today, but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates.
23/wsj_2337:While USA Today's total paid ad pages for the year to date totaled 2,735, a decrease of 4% from last year, the paper's ad revenue increased 8% in the quarter and 13% in the nine months.
23/wsj_2337:The year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $3.5 million, or four cents a share.
23/wsj_2337:The publisher of the Boston Globe reported net of $8.5 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $26.5 million, or 38 cents a share, for the third quarter in 1988. 
23/wsj_2337:Third-quarter profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint, which in the last two years has had several price increases.
23/wsj_2337:After a supply crunch caused prices to rise 14% since 1986 to $650 a metric ton, analysts are encouraged, because they don't expect a price increase for the rest of this year. 
23/wsj_2337:Mr. Atorino at Salomon Brothers said he estimates that Times Mirror Co. 's earnings were down for the third quarter, because of soft advertising levels at its Long Island Newsday and Hartford Courant newspapers.
23/wsj_2337:New York Times Co. is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship New York Times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate, Forest Products Group. 
23/wsj_2337:Washington Post Co. is expected to report improved earnings, largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the Washington area.
23/wsj_2337:However, analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers, such as the Miami Herald and San Jose Mercury News. 
23/wsj_2337:"The Miami market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years" when Knight-Ridder "was starting up a Hispanic edition and circulation was falling," said Bruce Thorp, an analyst for Provident National Bank. 
23/wsj_2338:General Motors Corp., in a series of moves that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada, has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity. 
23/wsj_2338:In announcements to workers late last week, GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants, and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories. 
23/wsj_2338:The company, currently using about 80% of its North American vehicle capacity, has vowed it will run at 100% of capacity by 1992.
23/wsj_2338:Now, GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s.
23/wsj_2338:The problem, however, is that GM's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs.
23/wsj_2338:Against that backdrop, UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich, who recently became head of the union's GM department, issued a statement Friday blasting GM's "flagrant insensitivity" toward union members.
23/wsj_2338:The auto maker's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed "disarray" and an "inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information," Mr. Yokich said. 
23/wsj_2338:GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves: 
23/wsj_2338:Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint, Mich.
23/wsj_2338:That means two plants -- one in Scarborough, Ontario, and the other in Lordstown, Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991.
23/wsj_2338:Workers at plants in Van Nuys, Calif., Oklahoma City and Pontiac, Mich., were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars.
23/wsj_2338:Jerry Shrieves, UAW local president, said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a "flex plant," which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand. 
23/wsj_2338:At the Oklahoma City plant, which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars, Steve Featherston, UAW local vice president, said the plant has no new product lined up, and "none of us knows" when the A-body cars will die.
23/wsj_2338:The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at GM before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year.
23/wsj_2338:Dissident UAW members have used the Fiero plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation's failure. 
23/wsj_2339:Institut Merieux S.A. of France said the Canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of Connaught BioSciences Inc. for 942 million Canadian dollars (US$801.6 million). 
23/wsj_2339:Merieux said the government's minister of industry, science and technology told it that he wasn't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of "net benefit" to Canada.
23/wsj_2339:Alan Nymark, executive vice president of Investment Canada, which oversees foreign takeovers, said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company.
23/wsj_2339:"This isn't a change in government policy; this provision has been used before," said Jodi Redmond, press secretary for Harvie Andre, Canada's minister of industry, science and technology.
23/wsj_2339:Spokesmen for Merieux and Connaught said they hadn't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or Investment Canada, but added they hope to have more information early this week. 
23/wsj_2339:Mr. Mehta said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out-of-court settlement of Connaught's dispute with the University of Toronto.
23/wsj_2339:The University is seeking to block the acquisition of Connaught by foreign interests, citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in Canada. 
23/wsj_2339:Some analysts, such as Murray Grossner of Toronto-based Richardson Greenshields Inc., believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders, such as Switzerland's Ciba-Geigy and Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, Calif.
23/wsj_2339:French state-owned Rhone-Poulenc S.A. holds 51% of Merieux. 
23/wsj_2340:Weatherford International Inc. said it canceled plans for a preferred-stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock, and added that it expects to publicly offer about 10 million common shares. 
23/wsj_2340:The company said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the 585,000 shares of its preferred stock outstanding.
23/wsj_2340:Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange. 
23/wsj_2340:The energy-services concern said, however, that in January 1990, it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock.
23/wsj_2340:Additionally, the company said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock, expected to be offered in November. 
23/wsj_2341:Earnings for most of the nation's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead briskly in the third quarter, as companies with newer, big-selling prescription drugs fared especially well. 
23/wsj_2341:For the third consecutive quarter, however, most of the companies' revenues were battered by adverse foreign-currency translations as a result of the strong dollar abroad. 
23/wsj_2341:Analysts said that Merck & Co., Eli Lilly & Co., Warner-Lambert Co. and the Squibb Corp. unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new, higher-priced medicines that provide wide profit margins.
23/wsj_2341:Less robust earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. were attributed to those companies' older products, many of which face stiffening competition from generic drugs and other medicines. 
23/wsj_2341:While that's not spectacular, Neil Sweig, an analyst with Prudential Bache, said that the rate of growth will "look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward." 
23/wsj_2341:Mr. Sweig estimated that Merck's profit for the quarter rose by about 22%, propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs, including its anti-cholesterol drug, Mevacor; a high blood pressure medicine, Vasotec; Primaxin, an antibiotic, and Pepcid, an anti-ulcer medication.
23/wsj_2341:Profit climbed even though Merck's sales were reduced by "one to three percentage points" as a result of the strong dollar, Mr. Sweig said.
23/wsj_2341:In the third quarter of 1988, Merck earned $311.8 million, or 79 cents a share. 
23/wsj_2341:Mr. Sweig said he estimated that Lilly's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20%, largely because of the performance of its new anti-depressant Prozac.
23/wsj_2341:The drug, introduced last year, is expected to generate sales of about $300 million this year. "It's turning out to be a real blockbuster," Mr. Sweig said. 
23/wsj_2341:Squibb's profit, estimated by analysts to be about 18% above the $123 million, or $1.25 a share, it earned in the third quarter of 1988, was the result of especially strong sales of its Capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease.
23/wsj_2341:Mr. Riccardo of Bear Stearns said that Schering-Plough Corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18% to 20%, and Bristol-Meyers's expected profit increase of about 13% are largely because "those companies are really managed well." ScheringPlough earned $94.4 million, or 84 cents a share, while Bristol-Myers earned $232.3 million, or 81 cents a share, in the like period a year earlier. 
23/wsj_2341:Meanwhile, analysts said Pfizer's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued, as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about 5%.
23/wsj_2341:Sales of Pfizer's important drugs, Feldene for treating arthritis, and Procardia, a heart medicine, have shrunk because of increased competition. "The (strong) dollar hurt Pfizer a lot, too," Mr. Sweig said.
23/wsj_2341:Sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs.
23/wsj_2342:Amid a crowd of crashing stocks, Relational Technology Inc. 's stock fell particularly hard Friday, dropping 23% because its problems were compounded by disclosure of an unexpected loss for its fiscal first quarter. 
23/wsj_2342:Relational Technology reported net income of $1.5 million, or 12 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 
23/wsj_2342:Mr. Newton said he accepted the resignation of Thomas Wilson, vice president of corporate sales, and that his marketing responsibilities have been reassigned.
23/wsj_2342:In the previous quarter, the company earned $4.5 million, or 37 cents a share, on sales of $47.2 million. 
23/wsj_2343:The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy (on Arthur Avenue) and, of course, the Yankees.
23/wsj_2343:However, most people, having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx, look at the borough the way Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy did in "Bonfire of the Vanities" -- as a wrong turn into hell. 
23/wsj_2343:But Laura Cunningham's Bronx, her childhood Bronx of the '50s, is something else altogether.
23/wsj_2343:Ms. Cunningham, a novelist and playwright, has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall.
23/wsj_2343:She transforms her "Bronx of the emotions, a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria" into the "Babylonian Bronx," a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue.
23/wsj_2343:In the Babylonian Bronx, Jewish working-class people lived in drab, Soviet-style buildings "glamorized" with names like AnaMor Towers (after owners Anna and Morris Snezak), whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks, friezes of Pompeii. 
23/wsj_2343:The games Bronx children played (holding kids down and stripping them, for example) seem tame by today's crack standards, but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure. "Without official knowledge of sex or death, we flirted with both," she writes.
23/wsj_2343:With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe, an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist (who rhymed river with liver in a love song); and Uncle Len, a mysterious part-time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope, like an "undercover President on a good-will mission." 
23/wsj_2343:Lily's grandmother, no cookie baker, excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album, and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress, "Philosophy for Women." 
23/wsj_2343:For the most part, though, there's much pleasure in her saucy, poignant probe into the mysteries of the Babylonian Bronx. 
23/wsj_2343:The Bronx also figures in Bruce Jay Friedman's latest novel, which flashes back to the New York of the '50s.
23/wsj_2343:But both the past and present worlds of "The Current Climate" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 200 pages, $18.95) feel cramped and static. 
23/wsj_2343:For his sixth novel, Mr. Friedman tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his 1972 work, "About Harry Towns." Harry is now a 57-year-old writer, whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out-of-synch.
23/wsj_2343:Harry fondly remembers the "old" days of the early '70s, when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong. "An L.A. solution," explains Mr. Friedman. 
23/wsj_2344:Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. said it agreed to pay $1.5 million as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho. 
23/wsj_2344:In 1984 the EPA notified Gulf Resources, which was a part-owner of the smelter, that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal Superfund program.
23/wsj_2344:Gulf Resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a Bermuda concern, potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter's cleanup costs.
23/wsj_2344:The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA, it "made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization." The company, which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday, said that $1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third-quarter statement.
23/wsj_2344:Gulf Resources added that it "will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the Superfund law." 
23/wsj_2344:The company's net worth cannot fall below $185 million after the dividends are issued. "The terms of that agreement only become effective the date of Gulf's reorganization, which we anticipate will occur sometime in early 1990," said Lawrence R. Mehl, Gulf's general counsel. 
23/wsj_2344:In addition, Gulf must give the government 20 days' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $50 million that are made to the Bermuda-based holding company.
23/wsj_2345:Many of the nation's highest-ranking executives saluted Friday's market plunge as an overdue comeuppance for speculators and takeover players. 
23/wsj_2345:Assuming that the market doesn't head into a bottomless free fall, some executives think Friday's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating. "This is a reaction to artificial LBO valuations, rather than to any fundamentals," said John Young, chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co., whose shares dropped $3.125 to $48.125. "If we get rid of a lot of that nonsense, it will be a big plus." 
23/wsj_2345:A few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the Business Council, a group that meets to discuss national issues, were only too happy to personalize their criticism. "People wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs, do something about takeovers, do something about Donald Trump," said Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT Corp., whose stock dropped $3.375. "Where's the leadership?
23/wsj_2345:The executives were remarkably unperturbed by the plunge even though it lopped billions of dollars off the value of their companies -- and millions off their personal fortunes. 
23/wsj_2345:"I'm not going to worry about one day's decline," said Kenneth Olsen, Digital Equipment Corp. president, who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company's shares plunged $5.75 to close at $86.50. "I didn't bother calling anybody; I didn't even turn on TV." 
23/wsj_2345:Of course, established corporate managements often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists.
23/wsj_2345:Indeed, one chief executive who was downright delighted by Friday's events was Robert Crandall, chairman of AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines and the target of a takeover offer by Mr. Trump.
23/wsj_2345:Of the 19 economists who worked on the Business Council forecast, only two projected periods of decline in the nation's output over the next two years, and in "both instances the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession," said Lewis Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan & Co. and vice chairman of the Business Council. 
23/wsj_2346:The real estate slump that's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city's retail real estate market. 
23/wsj_2346:Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy, turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom. 
23/wsj_2346:"There is an unbelievable amount of space available," says Faith Consolo, senior vice president at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc.
23/wsj_2346:There are about 2,000 stores for rent, up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500. "This further confuses retailers," she says. "They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down?
23/wsj_2346:A handful of hot retail locations, such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas, have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents.
23/wsj_2346:The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing. "As businesses contract or depart, the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks," says Edward A. Friedman, senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Inc. 
23/wsj_2346:It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores, which anchor retail neighborhoods, are in doubt.
23/wsj_2346:Hooker Corp., parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman's, is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale's is for sale by its owner, Campeau Corp. 
23/wsj_2346:The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents.
23/wsj_2346:But, despite the recent softening, for many of these retailers there's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s, when their leases were signed. 
23/wsj_2346:Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $500 a square foot, and $250 is not uncommon.
23/wsj_2346:The thriving 34th Street area offers rents of about $100 a square foot, as do up-and-coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue.
23/wsj_2346:Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, an Edinburgh, Scotland, financial services company, will list American depositary shares, representing preferred shares, with the symbol RBSPr.
23/wsj_2346:The American Stock Exchange listed shares of two companies. 
23/wsj_2346:The National Market System of the Nasdaq over-the-counter market listed shares of one company. 
23/wsj_2347:When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his 34th year on the Supreme Court today, the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure. 
23/wsj_2347:But are these four players, three of them in their 80s, ready to assume a different role after 88 years, collectively, of service on the high court? 
23/wsj_2347:But always, in years past, they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases.
23/wsj_2347:The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan, the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren.
23/wsj_2347:In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967, the height of the Warren Court's power, Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court.
23/wsj_2347:But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role, strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech. "Each time the court revisits an issue, the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result," he said.
23/wsj_2347:Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was "depressed" about the court's direction last spring, but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court's cutbacks in civil rights. "We could sweep it under the rug and hide it, but I'm not going to do it," he said in a speech last month. 
23/wsj_2347:But his level of frustration showed in a recent, impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago.
23/wsj_2347:Justice Stevens, 69, is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role, in part because he may be the least liberal of the four, but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others. 
23/wsj_2347:If the role these four dissenters are assuming is a familiar one in modern Supreme Court history, it also differs in an important way from recent history, court watchers say. "The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited," says Prof.
23/wsj_2347:A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School, "but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created." 
23/wsj_2348:The government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions, in its first wave of sales of big, sick thrifts, but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth. 
23/wsj_2348:The four S&Ls were sold to large banks, as was the case with most of the 28 previous transactions initiated by the Resolution Trust Corp. since it was created in the S&L bailout legislation two months ago. 
23/wsj_2348:Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C., which has aggressively expanded its markets, particularly in Texas and Florida.
23/wsj_2348:These "clean-bank" transactions leave the bulk of bad assets, mostly real estate, with the government, to be sold later.
23/wsj_2348:NCNB, for example, has been one of the highest rate payers in the Texas market, and in Florida, rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities. 
23/wsj_2348:For example, the delay in selling People's Heritage Savings, Salina, Kan., with $1.7 billion in assets, has forced the RTC to consider selling off the thrift branch-by-branch, instead of as a whole institution. 
23/wsj_2348:NCNB will acquire University Federal Savings Association, Houston, which had assets of $2.8 billion.
23/wsj_2348:NCNB Texas National Bank will pay the RTC a premium of $129 million for $3.5 billion in deposits.
23/wsj_2348:As a measure of the depths to which the Texas real estate market has sunk, the RTC will pay $3.8 billion to NCNB to take $750 million of bad assets. 
23/wsj_2348:NCNB also acquired Freedom Savings & Loan Association, Tampa, Fla., which had total assets of $900 million.
23/wsj_2348:NCNB will pay the RTC a premium of $40.4 million for $1.1 billion in deposits.
23/wsj_2348:NCNB will also acquire $266 million of Freedom's assets from the RTC, which will require $875 million in assistance. 
23/wsj_2348:Meridian will pay a premium of $30.5 million to assume $2 billion in deposits.
23/wsj_2348:It will also purchase $845 million of the thrift's assets, with $1.9 billion in RTC assistance. 
23/wsj_2349:American Cyanamid Co., offering of 1,250,000 common shares, via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.

23/wsj_2350:Time magazine, in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers, is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year, increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways. 
23/wsj_2350:In an announcement to its staff last week, executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will "dramatically de-emphasize" its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000, to four million; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $4 to $55. 
23/wsj_2350:Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high, and expensive, circulations is the way to draw advertisers.
23/wsj_2350:Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies.
23/wsj_2350:But Time, as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner, wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks.
23/wsj_2350:Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers. "What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and don't really read it," said Mr. Heinemann. "We are trying to create quality and involvement." 
23/wsj_2350:And Time's paid circulation, according to Audit Bureau of Circulations, dropped 7.3% to 4,393,237 in the six months ended June 30, 1989. 
23/wsj_2350:Still, Time's move is being received well, once again. "It's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more," said Michael Drexler, national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency. "A few drops in circulation are of no consequence.
23/wsj_2350:It's not a show of weakness; they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits." 
23/wsj_2350:Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry: a magazine's net revenue per subscriber, or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away. "The question is how much are we getting from each reader," said Mr. Heinemann. 
23/wsj_2351:When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago, Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing. "They said, `follow CNN,'" he told reporters. 
23/wsj_2351:That shows how far Ted Turner's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago, when it was considered the laughingstock of television news.
23/wsj_2351:It is bigger, faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks.
23/wsj_2351:Its niche as the "network of record" during major crises draws elite audiences around the world. 
23/wsj_2351:Although viewership soars when big news breaks, it ebbs during periods of calm.
23/wsj_2351:So CNN, a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc., is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel, or what people in the television industry call a "top of mind" network.
23/wsj_2351:The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full-length "signature" programming with recognizable stars.
23/wsj_2351:It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers.
23/wsj_2351:"The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables," says Jon Petrovich, executive vice president of Headline News, CNN's sister network. 
23/wsj_2351:Already, CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel, both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future.
23/wsj_2351:Its watchers are, on the whole, a disloyal group of channel-zapping "grazers" and news junkies, who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN, according to audience research.
23/wsj_2351:But 70% of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the network discovered, so CNN wants in.
23/wsj_2351:Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day, with most of the program, at least for now, appearing similar to CNN's other newcasts. 
23/wsj_2351:Some in the industry are skeptical. "I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what, at least in the public's mind, is the same news," says Reuven Frank, the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report. 
23/wsj_2351:In August, the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill, the former head of news specials at ABC.
23/wsj_2351:She's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly, in-depth segments, with an eye toward breaking big stories.
23/wsj_2351:That's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment, especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces. "They've never shown any inclination to spend money on production," says Michael Mosettig, a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job. 
23/wsj_2351:CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15%, but they're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks.
23/wsj_2351:Says Mr. Mosettig: "CNN is my wire service; they're on top of everything.
23/wsj_2351:They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage. "We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general-interest, long-format programming," says Robert Stengel, senior vice president, programming, of Continental Cablevision Inc., which holds a 2% stake in Turner Broadcasting. 
23/wsj_2352:The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the Arcadian Phosphate case did not repudiate the position Pennzoil Co. took in its dispute with Texaco, contrary to your Sept. 8 article "Court Backs Texaco's View in Pennzoil Case -- Too Late." 
23/wsj_2352:The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound.
23/wsj_2352:But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts.
23/wsj_2352:When you suggest otherwise, you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation. 
23/wsj_2353:Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association said Imperial Corp. of America withdrew from regulators its application to buy five Valley Federal branches, leaving the transaction in limbo. 
23/wsj_2353:The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at Imperial Corp., whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because of an informal notice that Imperial's thrift unit failed to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements. 
23/wsj_2353:Valley Federal, with assets of $3.3 billion, is based in Van Nuys.
23/wsj_2353:Imperial Corp., based in San Diego, is the parent of Imperial Savings & Loan.
23/wsj_2353:In the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $33.1 million. 
23/wsj_2354:Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers, developers and creditors. 
23/wsj_2354:The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC's massive legal bills, which topped $73 million last year. 
23/wsj_2354:The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch, best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team.
23/wsj_2354:Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals "that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings nor any means to collect from any other party, including FSLIC." 
23/wsj_2354:"If true," the court wrote, "this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds." But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas. 
23/wsj_2354:"This institution is just brain dead," says Mr. Haworth, a partner in the Dallas office of Andrews & Kurth, a Houston law firm. 
23/wsj_2354:But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group, the developer of Valley Ranch, dismisses such arguments as a "defense du jour." Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award, including the reversal of Sunbelt's foreclosure on Valley Ranch. 
23/wsj_2354:"We're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory," he says. "We'd take the Valley Ranch free and clear as a booby prize." 
23/wsj_2355:Kenneth J. Thygerson, who was named president of this thrift holding company in August, resigned, citing personal reasons.
23/wsj_2356:Thousands of supporters, many brandishing flags of the outlawed African National Congress, gave the anti-apartheid activists a tumultuous reception upon their return to black townships across the country.
23/wsj_2356:Most of those freed had spent at least 25 years in prison.
23/wsj_2356:The releases, announced last week by President de Klerk, were viewed as Pretoria's tacit legalization of the ANC. 
23/wsj_2356:Mandela, considered the most prominent leader of the ANC, remains in prison.
23/wsj_2356:The Soviet Union reported that thousands of tons of goods needed to ease widespread shortages across the nation were piled up at ports and rail depots, and food shipments were rotting because of a lack of people and equipment to move the cargo.
23/wsj_2356:Strikes and mismanagement were cited, and Premier Ryzhkov warned of "tough measures." 
23/wsj_2356:Bush indicated there might be "room for flexibility" in a bill to allow federal funding of abortions for poor women who are vicitims of rape and incest.
23/wsj_2356:He reiterated his opposition to such funding, but expressed hope of a compromise.
23/wsj_2356:The president, at a news conference Friday, also renewed a call for the ouster of Panama's Noriega. 
23/wsj_2356:The White House said minors haven't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents.
23/wsj_2356:The administration's policy was stated in a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions.
23/wsj_2356:Ten of the nation's governors, meanwhile, called on the justices to reject efforts to limit abortions. 
23/wsj_2356:The Justice Department announced that the FBI has been given the authority to seize U.S. fugitives overseas without the permission of foreign governments.
23/wsj_2356:Secretary of State Baker emphasized Friday that the new policy wouldn't be invoked by the Bush administration without full consideration of foreign-policy implications. 
23/wsj_2356:NASA pronounced the space shuttle Atlantis ready for launch tomorrow following a five-day postponement of the flight because of a faulty engine computer.
23/wsj_2356:Roh, who is facing calls for the reduction of U.S. military forces in South Korea, is to meet with Bush tomorrow and is to address a joint session of Congress on Wednesday. 
23/wsj_2356:China's Communist leadership voted to purge the party of "hostile and anti-party elements" and wealthy private businessmen, whom they called exploiters.
23/wsj_2356:Hundreds of East Germans flocked to Bonn's Embassy in Warsaw, bringing to more than 1,200 the number of emigres expected to flee to the West beginning today.
23/wsj_2356:Details of the talks, described by a Zairean official as "very delicate," weren't disclosed. 
23/wsj_2356:In the occupied lands, underground leaders of the Arab uprising rejected a U.S. plan to arrange Israeli-Palestinian talks as Shamir opposed holding such discussions in Cairo. 
23/wsj_2356:Lebanese Christian lawmakers presented to Arab mediators at talks in Saudi Arabia proposals for a new timetable for the withdrawal of Syria's forces from Lebanon.
23/wsj_2356:Hurricane Jerry threatened to combine with the highest tides of the year to swamp the Texas-Louisiana coast.
23/wsj_2356:Thousands of residents of low-lying areas were ordered to evacuate as the storm headed north in the Gulf of Mexico with 80 mph winds. 
23/wsj_2357:A group of Arby's franchisees said they formed an association to oppose Miami Beach financier Victor Posner's control of the restaurant chain. 
23/wsj_2357:At the time, a group called R.B. Partners Ltd., consisting of eight of Arby's largest franchisees, offered more than $200 million to buy Arby's Inc., which is part of DWG Corp. DWG is a holding company controlled by Mr. Posner.
23/wsj_2357:One week later, Leonard H. Roberts, president and chief executive officer of Arby's, was fired in a dispute with Mr. Posner. 
23/wsj_2357:Friday, 42 franchisees announced the formation of an association -- called A.P. Association Inc. -- to "preserve the integrity of the Arby's system." The franchisees, owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby's in the U.S., said: "We have concluded that continued control of Arby's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us, because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby's system.
23/wsj_2357:We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby's Inc. and the Arby's system." 
23/wsj_2358:That rise came on top of a 0.7% gain in August, and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy. 
23/wsj_2358:"I think the Friday report, combined with the actions of the Fed, weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
23/wsj_2358:But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers. 
23/wsj_2358:"The overall 0.9% increase is serious in itself, but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy, the producer price index still increased by 0.7%," said Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. 
23/wsj_2358:But Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis, blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump. "I would say this is not bad news; this is a blip," he said. "The core rate is not really out of line." 
23/wsj_2358:Overall, the index has climbed at a 5.1% compound annual rate since the start of the year, the Labor Department said.
23/wsj_2358:While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year, that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0% increase for all of 1988. 
23/wsj_2358:Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead, leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain. 
23/wsj_2358:But Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, said that last month's rise "isn't as bad an omen" as the 0.9% figure suggests. "If you examine the data carefully, the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices, rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods," he explained. 
23/wsj_2358:But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices, analysts said. 
23/wsj_2358:Sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7% after declining 0.6% in August, while sales of building materials fell 1.8% after rising 1.7%. 
23/wsj_2358:Prices for crude goods, an array of raw materials, jumped 1.1% after declining 1.9% in August and edging up 0.2% in July. 
23/wsj_2359:CityFed Financial Corp. said it expects to report a loss of at least $125 million to $150 million for the third quarter. 
23/wsj_2359:In the year-earlier period, CityFed had net income of $485,000, but no per-share earnings. 
23/wsj_2359:Approximately 85% of the total consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets.
23/wsj_2359:CityFed added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of City Federal Savings Bank, CityFed's primary subsidiary, based in Somerset, N.J. City Federal operates 105 banking offices in New Jersey and Florida. 
23/wsj_2359:Mr. Atherton said CityFed will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions divest themselves of such bonds.
23/wsj_2359:That action, CityFed said, will result in a charge against third-quarter results of approximately $30 million. 
23/wsj_2359:All these actions, Mr. Atherton said, will result in a loss of $125 million to $150 million for the third quarter.
23/wsj_2359:He added, however: "Depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages servicing and the outcome of the annual examination of City Federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves, the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range." 
23/wsj_2360:CenTrust Savings Bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock, indicating that regulators' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened. 
23/wsj_2360:In a statement, Miami-based CenTrust said the regulators cited the thrift's operating losses and "apparent losses" in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends.
23/wsj_2360:David L. Paul, chairman and chief executive officer, criticized the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, which issued the directive, saying it was "inappropriate" and based on "insufficient" reasons.
23/wsj_2360:The suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution's health. 
23/wsj_2360:In March, regulators labeled CenTrust a "troubled institution," largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses.
23/wsj_2360:In the same month, the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track. 
23/wsj_2360:For the nine months ended June 30, CenTrust had a net loss of $21.3 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $52.8 million.
23/wsj_2360:CenTrust, which is Florida's largest thrift, holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation.
23/wsj_2360:Mr. Paul said only about $150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
23/wsj_2360:The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings, but CenTrust has said it can't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market. 
23/wsj_2360:Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust's and other thrifts' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market.
23/wsj_2360:The legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new, somber regulatory climate. 
23/wsj_2360:In a statement Friday, Mr. Paul challenged the regulators' decision, saying the thrift's operating losses and "apparent" junk-bond losses "have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank." He also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds.
23/wsj_2360:Mr. Paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with approving CenTrust's request to sell 63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank, a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. based in Beverly Hills, Calif. 
23/wsj_2360:The branch sale is the centerpiece of CenTrust's strategy to transform itself into a traditional S&L from a high-flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits, according to Mr. Paul.
23/wsj_2360:It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $82 million, or about 1.2% of assets, from a negative $33 million as of Sept. 30, thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards. 
23/wsj_2360:CenTrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company's large amount of good will by about $180 million.
23/wsj_2360:Mr. Paul counters that he intends to further pare the size of CenTrust by not renewing more than $1 billion of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due.
23/wsj_2360:The thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds, and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate, as required under the new thrift law. 
23/wsj_2361:On a recent Saturday night, in the midst of West Germany's most popular prime-time show, a contestant bet the host that she could name any of 100 different cheeses after just one nibble, while blindfolded. 
23/wsj_2361:But perhaps even more remarkable, the three-hour-show, "Wetten Dass" (Make a Bet), regularly wins the top slot in the country's TV ratings, sometimes drawing as many as 50% of West German households. 
23/wsj_2361:Law." But much of what the Europeans want to protect seems every bit as cheesy as what they are trying to keep out. 
23/wsj_2361:The most militant opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers, who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60% of Europe's TV shows be produced in Europe.
23/wsj_2361:A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the European television dial suggest one reason why.
23/wsj_2361:More European air time is filled with low-budget game shows, variety hours, movies and talk shows, many of which are authorized knock-offs of their American counterparts. 
23/wsj_2361:One of France's most popular Saturday night programs features semi-celebrities seeking out their grammar-school classmates for on-air reunions.
23/wsj_2361:One of Italy's favorite shows, "Fantastico," a tepid variety show, is so popular that viewers clamored to buy a chocolate product, "Cacao Fantastico," whose praises were sung each week by dancing showgirls -- even though the product didn't exist. 
23/wsj_2361:Topping the cheese stunt, on another typical evening of fun on "Wetten Dass," a contestant won a bet with the show's host, Thomas Gottschalk, that he could identify 300 German dialects over the telephone.
23/wsj_2361:A celebrity guest, U.S. Ambassador to West Germany Richard Burt, also won a bet that someone could pile up $150 worth of quarters on a slanted coin.
23/wsj_2361:European programs usually target only their own local audience, and often only a small portion of that.
23/wsj_2361:One annual co-production, the three-hour-long "Eurovision Song Contest," featuring soft-rock songs from each of 20 European countries, has been described as the world's most boring TV show.
23/wsj_2361:Another, "Jeux Sans Frontieres," where villagers from assorted European countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks, is a hit in France.
23/wsj_2361:The cream of the British crop, the literary dramas that are shown on U.S. public television as "Masterpiece Theater," make up a relatively small part of British air time.
23/wsj_2361:Most British programming is more of an acquired taste.
23/wsj_2361:Also riveting to the British are hours of dart-throwing championships, even more hours of lawn bowling contests and still more hours of snooker marathons. 
23/wsj_2361:A French knock-off of "Dallas," called "Chateauvallon" and set in a French vineyard, had a good run in France, which ended after the female lead was injured in a real-life auto accident. "Schwarzwaldklinik," (Black Forest Clinic), a kind of German "St.
23/wsj_2361:Italy's most popular series is a drama called "La Piovra," or "The Octopus," which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in Palermo against the Mafia.
23/wsj_2361:Spain's most popular mini-series this year was "Juncal," the story of an aging bullfighter. 
23/wsj_2361:"The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular, with American programs second," says Brian Wenham, a former director of programs for the British Broadcasting Corp. "Given a choice, everybody will watch a home-produced show." 
23/wsj_2361:Thus, Europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own, programs with broader appeal. "We've basically got to start from scratch, to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see," concedes Colin Young, head of Britain's National Film Theatre School. 
23/wsj_2361:While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television, here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry's sluggish development.
23/wsj_2361:Until recently, national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising.
23/wsj_2361:But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas, most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the U.S. 
23/wsj_2361:Sky Channel, a British-based venture of Australian-American press tycoon Rupert Murdoch, offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its audience.
23/wsj_2361:In a Madrid hotel room recently, a viewer caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, only to be urged by the British announcer to "stay tuned for the further adventures of Skippy the Kangaroo." 
23/wsj_2362:The 50-50 joint venture, which may be dubbed Eurodynamics, would have combined annual sales of at least #1.4 billion ($2.17 billion) and would be among the world's largest missile makers.
23/wsj_2362:After two years of talks, plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance.
23/wsj_2362:In recent months, a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture. 
23/wsj_2362:The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe's defense industry.
23/wsj_2362:Yesterday, a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight, as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF.
23/wsj_2362:A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti: "Competition is the name of the game," she said. 
23/wsj_2362:For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries; and Middle East sales, a traditional mainstay for both companies' exports, have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices. 
23/wsj_2362:Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans.
23/wsj_2362:The European defense industry is consolidating; for instance, West Germany's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain's Plessey Co., and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b.
23/wsj_2362:To justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture, Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace. 
23/wsj_2362:Annual revenue of British Aerospace's missile business is about #950 million, a Thomson spokesman said.
23/wsj_2362:British Aerospace's chief missile products include its 17-year-old family of Rapier surface-to-air missiles.
23/wsj_2363:Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. said it will delay a proposed two-step, 830 million Canadian-dollar (US$705.6 million) expansion of its system because Canada's output of crude oil is shrinking. 
23/wsj_2363:Interprovincial, Canada's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S., said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991, 8% lower than a previous estimate.
23/wsj_2363:"The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping," and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas, said Ronald Watkins, vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial's parent, Interhome Energy Inc. Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected to fall further, making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s. 
23/wsj_2363:"There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side," he said. 
23/wsj_2363:Many of Canada's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly.
23/wsj_2363:The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is "down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration," said Robert Feick, manager of crude oil with Calgary's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group. 
23/wsj_2363:Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western Canada.
23/wsj_2363:Interprovincial transports about 75% of all crude produced in western Canada, and almost 60% of Interprovincial's total volume consists of light crude. 
23/wsj_2363:Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial's system, whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region, including Chicago, Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal. 
23/wsj_2363:Canada's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net U.S. crude imports, said John Lichtblau, president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
23/wsj_2363:That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude, behind Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico. 
23/wsj_2363:Mr. Lichtblau said Canada's declining crude output, combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude, will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas, particularly the Middle East. "It's very much a growing concern.
23/wsj_2363:Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial's proposed expansion won't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude, however, since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada's falling output. 
23/wsj_2363:Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion, which would have required regulatory approval, Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system, beginning with a modest expansion by 1991.
23/wsj_2363:The system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day. 
23/wsj_2364:Inland Steel Industries Inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than 50% from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs. 
23/wsj_2364:In the second quarter, the steelmaker had net income of $45.3 million or $1.25 a share, including a pretax charge of $17 million related to the settlement of a suit, on sales of $1.11 billion. 
23/wsj_2364:In the year-earlier third quarter, when the industry was in the midst of a boom, the company had net of $61 million, or $1.70 a share, on sales of $1.02 billion. 
23/wsj_2365:Predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately. 
23/wsj_2365:Take Microsoft Corp., the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether.
23/wsj_2365:In July, the company stunned Wall Street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only 10% in 1990, a modest increase when compared with the sizzling expansion of years past. 
23/wsj_2365:But that was all of three months ago. 
23/wsj_2365:Microsoft's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms. "It's hard to know what to expect at this point," said Peter Rogers, an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co. "The industry defies characterization." 
23/wsj_2365:To illustrate, Mr. Rogers said that of the 14 computer-related firms he follows, half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year's results, and half above those results. 
23/wsj_2365:In July, the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $7.4 million, or 23 cents a share. 
23/wsj_2365:The company said it expects earnings of 14 to 17 cents a share, down from 25 cents a share in the year-earlier period. 
23/wsj_2365:Now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to Adobe's approach, and analysts say they are likely to carry IBM, the biggest seller of personal computers, along with them. 
23/wsj_2365:The company is beginning to ship a new software program that's being heralded as a boon for owners of low-end printers sold by Apple.
23/wsj_2365:The program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material.
23/wsj_2365:Meanwhile, competition between various operating systems, which control the basic functions of a computer, spells trouble for software firms generally. "It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales," said Russ Crabs, an analyst at Soundview Financial Group. 
23/wsj_2365:Mr. Crabs said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of Aldus Corp., maker of a widely used computer publishing program.
23/wsj_2365:He expects Aldus to report earnings of 21 cents a share on revenues of $19.5 million for its third quarter, compared with earnings of 30 cents a share on revenue of 20.4 million in the year-earlier period.
23/wsj_2365:On the other hand, the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant.
23/wsj_2365:IBM is backing one type of bus called microchannel, while the nine other leading computer makers, including H-P and Compaq Computer Corp., have chosen another method. 
23/wsj_2365:He said Apple's family of Macintosh computers, for instance, uses four different buses "and no one seems to mind." 
23/wsj_2365:Mr. Brown estimates Wyse, whose terminals business is strong, will report a loss of 12 cents a share for its quarter ended Sept. 
23/wsj_2365:Personal-computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms.
23/wsj_2365:As a result of this trend, longtime powerhouses H-P, IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor-based systems of their own.
23/wsj_2365:Mr. Benton expects Compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk-top machines. 
23/wsj_2365:A raft of new computer companies also has targeted this "server" market. 
23/wsj_2366:The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new Census Bureau estimates, following declines throughout the early 1980s. 
23/wsj_2366:Between 1987 and 1988, North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people.
23/wsj_2366:Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, South Dakota and Wisconsin. 
23/wsj_2366:Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980, including New York, which lost 4% of its population during the 1970s.
23/wsj_2366:And even after losing a spouse, more of the elderly are staying independent.
23/wsj_2366:A new Census Bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that 64% of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in 1988, up from 59% in 1970. 
23/wsj_2366:What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children.
23/wsj_2366:In 1988, 10% of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses, down from 15% in 1970. 
23/wsj_2366:Only 17% of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988, down from 26% in 1970. 
23/wsj_2366:The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40% from 32%.
23/wsj_2366:Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs, while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families.
23/wsj_2366:Unlike most studies of the affluent market, this survey excluded the super-rich.
23/wsj_2366:The goal was to learn about one of today's fastest-growing income groups, the upper-middle class.
23/wsj_2366:Although they represent only 2% of the population, they control nearly one-third of discretionary income. 
23/wsj_2366:Despite their considerable incomes and assets, 40% of the respondents in the study don't feel financially secure, and one-fourth don't feel that they have made it.
23/wsj_2366:Many of the affluent aren't comfortable with themselves, either.
23/wsj_2366:THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978.
23/wsj_2366:The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47% of officials and managers in the top 50 banks, up from 33% in 1978.
23/wsj_2366:The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16% from 12%. . . . Per-capita personal income in the U.S. grew faster than inflation last year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
23/wsj_2366:The amount of income divvied up for each man, woman and child was $16,489 in 1988, up 6.6% from $15,472 in 1987.
23/wsj_2367:Harold Hill, the con man in Meredith Willson's "The Music Man," warned the citizens of River City, Iowa, against the game.
23/wsj_2367:Mayor Lynn Spruill and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along Addison's main street.
23/wsj_2367:The council's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years. "Obviously they're not in touch with what's going on," says Tom Manske, vice president of the National Pocket Billiards Association.
23/wsj_2367:But a majority of the Addison council didn't buy those arguments.
23/wsj_2367:It would open a can of worms." 
23/wsj_2367:Addison is no stranger to cans of worms, either.
23/wsj_2367:"I think there's some people worried about something pretty ridiculous," Councilman John Nolan says. "I thought this was all taken care of in `The Music Man. '" 
23/wsj_2368:The only thing Robert Goldberg could praise about CBS's new show "Island Son" (Leisure & Arts, Sept. 25) was the local color; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework.
23/wsj_2368:Sorry, the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color. 
23/wsj_2369:Of all the ethnic tensions in America, which is the most troublesome right now?
23/wsj_2369:Not only is Mr. Mason the star of "Chicken Soup," he's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to "Duck Soup," and he's currently a man in hot water. 
23/wsj_2369:Here, in neutral language, is the gist of Mr. Mason's remarks, quoted first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign, and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign parted company.
23/wsj_2369:Of course, Mr. Mason did not use neutral language.
23/wsj_2369:As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt, live television and the nightclub circuit, Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular.
23/wsj_2369:If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers, would the water be quite so hot?
23/wsj_2369:It probably would, because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language.
23/wsj_2369:In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism. 
23/wsj_2369:These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group, such as "Polish jokes"; and the type that is double-edged, aiming inward as well as outward.
23/wsj_2369:The latter typically is the humor of the underdog, and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves. 
23/wsj_2369:In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce, this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons.
23/wsj_2369:But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason, it is a constructive form of mischief.
23/wsj_2369:Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing, they are similar in one respect: Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict.
23/wsj_2369:That's why it's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police, on college campuses and elsewhere, taboo all critical mention of group differences. 
23/wsj_2369:As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook, "Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer." The question is, if group conflicts still exist (as undeniably they do), and if Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe, then what other means do we have for letting off steam? 
23/wsj_2369:In "Chicken Soup," Mr. Mason plays Jackie, a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie (Lynn Redgrave), an Irish widow and mother of three, against the wishes of his mother (Rita Karin) and her brother Michael (Brandon Maggart).
23/wsj_2369:And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam. 
23/wsj_2369:Back in the 1920s, the play and movie versions of "Abie's Irish Rose" made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author, Anne Nichols, lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain.
23/wsj_2369:And it has remained there, as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called "Bridget Loves Bernie," whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney. 
23/wsj_2369:Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms, ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear, to preach about social issues.
23/wsj_2369:But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about "caring for other people" that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America.
23/wsj_2370:The official White House reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a 60-year history of calm, right up through Friday. 
23/wsj_2370:Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a statement Friday that the stock-market decline "doesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy." 
23/wsj_2370:After the 1929 crash, Herbert Hoover said: "The fundamental business of the country . . . is on a sound and prosperous basis." 
23/wsj_2371:James Robinson, 57 years old, was elected president and chief executive officer of this maker of magnetic recording heads for disk drives.
23/wsj_2371:He has been president and chief executive officer of Amperex Electronics Corp., a division of North American Philips Corp., itself a subsidiary of N.V. Philips of the Netherlands.
23/wsj_2372:The Senate's decision to approve a bare-bones deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction this year. 
23/wsj_2372:Late Friday night, the Senate voted 87-7 to approve an estimated $13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened, rather than narrowed, the federal budget deficit.
23/wsj_2372:"We're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.). 
23/wsj_2372:But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside, including a capital-gains tax cut.
23/wsj_2372:White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the administration wouldn't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill. "We don't need this as a way to get capital gains," he said. 
23/wsj_2372:The Senate's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year.
23/wsj_2372:Opponents of the cut are playing hardball.
23/wsj_2372:Such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month. 
23/wsj_2372:"Although I am encouraged by the Senate action," said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee, "it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate." 
23/wsj_2372:The Senate bill was stripped of many popular, though revenue-losing, provisions, a number of which are included in the House-passed bill.
23/wsj_2372:These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures.
23/wsj_2372:Also missing from the Senate bill is the House's repeal of a law, called Section 89, that compels companies to give rank-and-file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives. 
23/wsj_2372:One high-profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts.
23/wsj_2372:To the delight of some doctors, the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare.
23/wsj_2372:To the detriment of many low-income people, efforts to boost Medicaid funding, especially in rural areas, also were stricken. 
23/wsj_2372:It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed-contract method of accounting, which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden.
23/wsj_2372:The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell, who had proposed the streamlining.
23/wsj_2372:The measure repeals a 50% exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP, if the ESOP owns less than 30% of the employer's stock. 
23/wsj_2372:-- Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies, effective August 1990. 
23/wsj_2372:-- Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding. 
23/wsj_2372:-- Change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to weekly from semimonthly, effective next year. 
23/wsj_2372:-- Restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash. 
23/wsj_2372:-- Reduction of Medicare spending in fiscal 1990 by some $2.8 billion, in part by curbing increases in reimbursements to physicians.
23/wsj_2372:-- Removal of the U.S. Postal Service's operating budget from the federal budget, reducing the deficit by $1.77 billion.
23/wsj_2372:-- Direction to the U.S. Coast Guard to collect $50 million from users of Coast Guard services. 
23/wsj_2373:The statistics quoted by the "new" Census Bureau report (garnered from 1984 to 1986) are out of date, certainly as an average for the Northeast, and possibly for the rest of the country. 
23/wsj_2373:To top it off, you captioned the graph showing the average number of months in a job search as "Time Off." Are you kidding?
23/wsj_2373:Looking for a job was one of the most anxious periods of my life -- and is for most people.
23/wsj_2374:BULL HN INFORMATION SYSTEMS Inc. is a U.S. majority-owned unit of Cie. des Machines Bull.
23/wsj_2374:In Friday's edition, the name of the unit was misstated. 
23/wsj_2375:Moody's Investors Service said it reduced its rating on $165 million of subordinated debt of this Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift, citing turmoil in the market for low-grade, high-yield securities.
23/wsj_2375:Columbia Savings is a major holder of so-called junk bonds.
23/wsj_2375:New federal legislation requires that all thrifts divest themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years.
23/wsj_2375:FRANKLIN SAVINGS ASSOCIATION (Ottawa, Kan.) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded its rating to B-2 from Ba-3 on less than $20 million of this thrift's senior subordinated notes.
23/wsj_2375:The rating concern said Franklin's "troubled diversification record in the securities business" was one reason for the downgrade, citing the troubles at its L.F. Rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries. "They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these," said Franklin President Duane H. Hall. "I think it was a little premature on their part." 
23/wsj_2376:Just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks, Wall Street suffered another severe attack of nerves. 
23/wsj_2376:I see a possibility of going to 2200 this month." 
23/wsj_2376:Mr. Granville says he wouldn't even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52-week lows; about 100 stocks hit new lows Friday. "Most people," he says, "have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like." 
23/wsj_2376:A quantitative analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Ms. Garzarelli had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the 1987 crash. 
23/wsj_2376:She says that ratio could climb to 14.5, given current interest rates, and still be within the range of "fair value." 
23/wsj_2376:Friday's fall marks the start of a bear market, says Mr. Davis, president of Ned Davis Research Inc.
23/wsj_2376:Sort of a two-step bear market." He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around 2000 sometime next year. "That would be a normal bear market," he says. "I guess that's my forecast." 
23/wsj_2376:I don't think that's the case at all," says Mr. Cooperman, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Co. and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. 
23/wsj_2376:And unlike 1987, the economy doesn't appear to be in any danger of overheating. 
23/wsj_2376:But we came into Friday with a conservative portfolio, so I would look to do some modest buying" on behalf of clients. "We're going to look for some of the better-known companies that got clocked" Friday. 
23/wsj_2376:John Kenneth Galbraith. "This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity," says Mr. Galbraith, an economist. 
23/wsj_2376:"I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion," he says. "The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity.
23/wsj_2376:Examples are "Ford looking at Jaguar, BellSouth looking at LIN Broadcasting." These sorts of takeovers don't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them, so Mr. Gabelli figures they will continue. 
23/wsj_2376:Jim Rogers. "It seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon," says Mr. Rogers, a professor of finance at Columbia University and former co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history, Quantum Fund. 
23/wsj_2376:He sees "economic problems, financial problems" ahead for the U.S., with a fairly strong possibility of a recession. "Friday you couldn't sell dollars," he says.
23/wsj_2376:He recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks, but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities, which often do well during periods of economic weakness. 
23/wsj_2376:Stock prices "would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks," says Mr. Terrizzi, president and managing director of Renaissance Investment Management Inc. in Cincinnati. 
23/wsj_2376:Renaissance, which manages about $1.8 billion, drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally. 
23/wsj_2377:Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. Tom Lantos, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing, alleging: 
23/wsj_2377:That Mr. Lantos supported the rights of the witnesses to take the Fifth Amendment. 
23/wsj_2377:As I watched him on C-Span, I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights, which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings.
23/wsj_2377:He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution.
23/wsj_2377:He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary.
23/wsj_2377:By any "reasonable man" criterion, Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted.
23/wsj_2377:Of course, Mr. Lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change.
23/wsj_2377:But if his explanation of motivation is true, why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity?
23/wsj_2377:Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency?
23/wsj_2377:That the Journal defends "the sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence-peddling and abuse of the public that took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD," etc. and so forth. 
23/wsj_2377:No, to my mind, the Journal did not "defend sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust . . ." it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense. 
23/wsj_2377:The problem, which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles, is not the likes of Mr. Lantos, who after all is really a bit player on the stage, but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary/judicial body. (Of course, we've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective.) The system is the problem, not an individual member.
23/wsj_2377:But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency (and, yes, maybe criminality) within HUD could possibly generate.
23/wsj_2377:The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person "shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself." This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify.
23/wsj_2377:Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter.
23/wsj_2377:Absent the risk of such prosecution, a court may order the defendant to testify. 
23/wsj_2377:The subcommittee, Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime.
23/wsj_2378:Or is triskaidekaphobia -- fear of the number 13 -- justified? 
23/wsj_2378:Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez, professors of finance at the University of Miami, found evidence that the market is spooked by Friday the 13th.
23/wsj_2378:But their study, which spanned the 1962-85 period, has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data. 
23/wsj_2378:But the date tends to be a plus, not a minus, for stocks, according to Yale Hirsch, a collector of stock market lore. 
23/wsj_2378:In a similar vein, he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday's full moon could have played a part, too, in Friday's market activity. 
23/wsj_2379:reminiscent of those during the 1987 crash -- that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated, some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went unanswered. 
23/wsj_2379:"We couldn't get dealers to answer their phones," said Robert King, senior vice president of OTC trading at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta. "It was {like} the Friday before Black Monday" two years ago. 
23/wsj_2379:Nonetheless, the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever, diving 14.90, or 3%, to 467.29.
23/wsj_2379:Ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading.
23/wsj_2379:The single-day record of 288 million shares was set on Oct. 21, 
23/wsj_2379:"There wasn't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved," said E.E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld, a New York company that makes markets in thousands of OTC issues. 
23/wsj_2379:Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors.
23/wsj_2379:Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders' inability to handle the volume of calls, rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades. 
23/wsj_2379:The subject is a sore one for Nasdaq and its market-making companies, which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who couldn't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash. 
23/wsj_2379:Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, declared: "It was the last hour of trading on a Friday.
23/wsj_2379:James Tarantino, head of OTC trading at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, said, "It was just like two years ago.
23/wsj_2379:Jeremiah Mullins, the OTC trading chief at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, said proudly that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading.
23/wsj_2379:Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur.
23/wsj_2379:Two years ago, faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories, market makers themselves began dumping shares, exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices. 
23/wsj_2379:Mr. Tarantino of Hambrecht & Quist said some prices fell without trades taking place, as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares. "Everyone was hitting everyone else's bid," he said. 
23/wsj_2379:I don't know of anyone carrying big inventories now," said Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey. 
23/wsj_2379:Tony Cecin, head of equity trading at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis, said that Piper Jaffray actually made money on Friday.
23/wsj_2379:Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees the Nasdaq computerized trading system, said that despite the rush of selling, he never considered the situation an "emergency." 
23/wsj_2379:"The pace of trading was orderly," he said.
23/wsj_2379:Nevertheless, the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors' confidence.
23/wsj_2379:In the past, the OTC market thrived on a firm base of small-investor participation.
23/wsj_2379:But they are worried. "We were just starting to get the public's confidence back," lamented Mr. Mullins of Dean Witter. 
23/wsj_2379:More troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of small-investor support the OTC market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the October 1987 crash. 
23/wsj_2379:Mr. Cecin of Piper Jaffray says some action from government policy makers would allay investor fears.
23/wsj_2379:It won't take much more to "scare the hell out of retail investors," he says. 
23/wsj_2379:The sellers on Friday came from all corners of the OTC market -- big and small institutional investors, as well as individual investors and market makers.
23/wsj_2379:But grateful traders said the sell orders generally ranged from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares, compared with blocks of 500,000 shares or more two years ago. 
23/wsj_2379:"We had a good amount of selling from institutions, but not as much panic," Mr. DaPuzzo said. "If they couldn't sell, some of them put the shares back on the shelf." In addition, he said, some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some OTC stocks whose prices were beaten down. 
23/wsj_2379:In addition, Mr. DaPuzzo said computer-guided program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of 2000 small stocks and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index sent occasional "waves " through the market. 
23/wsj_2379:The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest nonfinancial issues, including the big OTC technology issues, tumbled 4.2%, or 19.76, to 449.33.
23/wsj_2379:The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped 2%, or 9.31, to 462.98. 
23/wsj_2379:The OTC market has only a handful of takeover-related stocks.
23/wsj_2379:On a day when negative takeover-related news didn't sit well with investors, Commercial Intertech, a maker of engineered metal parts, said Haas & Partners advised it that it doesn't plan to pursue its previously reported $27.50-a-share bid to buy the company.
23/wsj_2379:The issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled Friday.
23/wsj_2379:On the OTC market, First Executive, a big buyer of the high-risk, high-yield issues, slid 2 to 12 1/4. 
23/wsj_2379:Among other OTC issues, Intel, dropped 2 1/8 to 33 7/8; Laidlaw Transportation lost 1 1/8 to 19 1/2; the American depositary receipts of Jaguar were off 1/4 to 10 1/4; MCI Communications slipped 2 1/4 to 43 1/2; Apple Computer fell 3 to 45 3/4 and Nike dropped 2 1/4 to 66 3/4. 
23/wsj_2380:Reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use in amounts of $1 million or more.
23/wsj_2380:COMMERCIAL PAPER: High-grade unsecured notes sold through dealers by major corporations in multiples of $1,000: 8.65% 30 days; 8.55% 60 days; 8.55% 90 days. 
23/wsj_2380:CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT: 8.15% one month; 8.15% two months; 8.13% three months; 8.11% six months; 8.08% one year.
23/wsj_2380:Average of top rates paid by major New York banks on primary new issues of negotiable C.D.s, usually on amounts of $1 million and more.
23/wsj_2380:The average of interbank offered rates for dollar deposits in the London market based on quotations at five major banks. 
23/wsj_2380:TREASURY BILLS: Results of the Tuesday, October 10, 1989, auction of short-term U.S. government bills, sold at a discount from face value in units of $10,000 to $1 million: 7.63% 13 weeks; 7.60% 26 weeks. 
23/wsj_2380:Annualized average rate of return after expenses for the past 30 days; not a forecast of future returns. 
23/wsj_2381:Pension funds, insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during Friday's market rout.
23/wsj_2381:They could still panic and bail out of the market.
23/wsj_2381:"Last time, we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst," said John W. Rogers, president of Chicago-based Ariel Capital Management Inc., which manages $1.1 billion of stocks. 
23/wsj_2381:Denver-based portfolio manager James Craig wasn't daunted when Friday's rout shaved $40 million from the value of the $752 million Janus Fund he oversees. "I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through," he said.
23/wsj_2381:Other money managers also opened their wallets. "I was buying at the close (Friday) and I'll be buying again because I know we're getting good value," said Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., Greenwich, Conn. "There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash." 
23/wsj_2381:"If you bought after the crash, you did very very well off the bottom," said Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc.
23/wsj_2381:"The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders, and that they can't react to short-term events, good or bad," said Stephen L. Nesbitt, senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica, Calif. "Those that pulled out (of stocks) regretted it," he said, "so I doubt you'll see any significant changes" in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday's decline. 
23/wsj_2381:"You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market," said James D. Awad, president of New York-based BMI Capital Corp. 
23/wsj_2381:It can happen before you can turn around." He said he discerns many parallels with 1987, including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading. "The only thing you don't have," he said, "is the `portfolio insurance' phenomenon overlaid on the rest." 
23/wsj_2381:Not really insurance, this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts.
23/wsj_2381:In its severest test, the $60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash didn't work, as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected. 
23/wsj_2381:Neil Weisman, whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85% of its $220 million investment pool to cash in recent months, said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands. 
23/wsj_2381:The nation's largest short-selling operation is Feshbach Brothers, Palo Alto, Calif., which said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10% for the year up to that point. 
23/wsj_2381:All that now has changed. "We're ahead for the year because of Friday," said the firm's Kurt Feshbach. "We're not making a killing, but we had a good day." 
23/wsj_2382:Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens, N.Y., company's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes.
23/wsj_2382:Vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a SmithKline Beecham PLC product as its own in tests. 
23/wsj_2382:Bolar, the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General's office of the Health and Human Services Department, only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin "as far down as direct customers, mostly wholesalers," Mr. Nesbit said. 
23/wsj_2382:Bolar, of Copiague, N.Y., earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug. 
23/wsj_2382:The FDA has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand-name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of Macrodantin.
23/wsj_2383:The West German retailer ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the Netherlands. 
23/wsj_2383:The eventual court decision could become a landmark in Dutch corporate law because the lawsuit ASKO plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management-controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders. 
23/wsj_2383:Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged, though unsuccessfully, ASKO's Dutch lawyers noted. 
23/wsj_2383:Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense, ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV. ASKO says the Dutch-based international food retailer hadn't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders. 
23/wsj_2383:A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred-share issue.
23/wsj_2384:"There are some very significant issues out there, such as the fiscal deficit, the trade deficit, our relations with Japan, that have to be the subject of major initiatives," he said in an interview. "I'd like to see that initiative, and I haven't.
23/wsj_2384:But Mr. Butcher's comments make one thing clear: Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy. 
23/wsj_2384:-- By 11:59 p.m. tonight, President Bush must order $16 billion of automatic, across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget law.
23/wsj_2384:The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower; the Fed has been resisting. "One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board," said Lawrence Kudlow, a Bear, Stearns & Co. economist, on ABC's "This Week." 
23/wsj_2384:-- The administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers. 
23/wsj_2384:In many ways, the backdrop to Friday's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987's 508-point crash.
23/wsj_2384:Then, as now, the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold.
23/wsj_2384:One of the biggest reasons that new talks aren't likely to come about is that, as everyone learned in 1987, the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble. "Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929, that we were looking at a recession," Rep. Panetta said yesterday in an interview. "That did not happen.
23/wsj_2384:In that case, there will be plenty of blame to go around. "There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be-that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut," said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas). 
23/wsj_2384:Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation. 
23/wsj_2384:"There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply didn't live up to this year's deal," Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said yesterday on CBS News's "Face the Nation." 
23/wsj_2384:When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation, Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, hailed it.
23/wsj_2384:Friday's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure, a process that isn't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest. 
23/wsj_2384:Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate, which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit. 
23/wsj_2384:"The market needs a strong signal that we're serious about deficit reduction, and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill" of similar provisions, Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.). said yesterday. 
23/wsj_2384:The White House Office of Management and Budget, whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met, estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $6.2 billion, almost half of the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of $11.0 billion.
23/wsj_2384:Before the sun had set on Friday, Richard Rahn, the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains. "Investors, who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell, were spooked," he said. 
23/wsj_2384:"There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut," Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance, "but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others." 
23/wsj_2385:$15.2 billion of three-month and six-month bills. 
23/wsj_2385:$9.75 billion of 52-week bills. 
23/wsj_2385:Connecticut Light & Power Co. -- Three million shares of $25 preferred, via competitive bidding. 
23/wsj_2385:Oregon -- $100 million of general obligation veterans' tax notes, Series 1989, via competitive bid. 
23/wsj_2385:Washington, D.C. -- $200 million of 1990 general obligation tax revenue notes (Series 1990A), via competitive bid. 
23/wsj_2385:Virginia Public School Authority -- $55,730,000 of school financing bonds, 1989 Series B (1987 resolution), via competitive bid. 
23/wsj_2385:Austin, Texas -- $68,230,000 of various bonds, including $32 million hotel occupancy tax revenue bonds, Series 1989A, and $36.23 million convention center revenue bonds, Series 1989B, via a Morgan Stanley & Co. group. 
23/wsj_2385:California Health Facilities Financing Authority -- $144.5 million of Kaiser Permanente revenue bonds, via a PaineWebber group. 
23/wsj_2385:Connecticut -- $100 million of general obligation capital appreciation bonds, College Savings Plan, 1989 Series B, via a Prudential-Bache Capital Funding group. 
23/wsj_2385:Pennsylvania Higher Education Facilities Authority -- $117 million of revenue bonds for Hahnemann University, Series 1989, via a Merrill Lynch group. 
23/wsj_2385:Tennessee Valley Authority -- Three billion of power bonds, via First Boston Corp. 
23/wsj_2385:University of Medicine And Dentistry of New Jersey -- $55 million of Series C bonds, via a Prudential-Bache group. 
23/wsj_2385:West Virginia Parkways, Economic Development And Tourism Authority -- $143 million of parkway revenue bonds, Series 1989, via a PaineWebber group. 
23/wsj_2385:San Antonio, Texas -- $640 million of gas and electric revenue refunding bonds, via a First Boston group. 
23/wsj_2385:South Dakota Health & Education Facility Authority -- $51.1 million of Rapid City Regional Hospital bonds, via a Dougherty, Dawkins, Strand & Yost Inc. group. 
23/wsj_2386:"I'm not losing faith in the market," said Boston lawyer Christopher Sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm.
23/wsj_2386:Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash, "but no one got discouraged, and we gained that back -- and more." 
23/wsj_2386:At the annual congress of the National Association of Investors Corp. at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Minneapolis, the scene was calm.
23/wsj_2386:But Robert Showalter, an official of the association, said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors' clubs are planned. 
23/wsj_2386:In fact, some of the association's members -- long-term, buy-and-hold investors -- welcomed the drop in prices. "We hope to take advantage of it," said John Snyder, a member of a Los Angeles investors' club.
23/wsj_2386:Not everyone is reacting so calmly, however, and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday's slide, reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines. 
23/wsj_2386:Marc Perkins, a Tampa, Fla., investment banker, said the market drop is one of "a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending.
23/wsj_2386:There's no question that there's a general distaste for leverage among lenders." Mr. Perkins believes, however, that the market could be stabilized if California investor Marvin Davis steps back in to the United bidding with an offer of $275 a share. 
23/wsj_2386:Sara Albert, a 34-year-old Dallas law student, says she's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it. "I have this feeling that it's built on sand," she says, that the market rises "but there's no foundation to it." She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash, although she still owns some Texaco stock.
23/wsj_2386:Partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school, "I think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid." 
23/wsj_2386:Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand. "We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot," said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg. "We told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime, come on back.
23/wsj_2386:This time he's ready to buy in "when the panic wears off." Still, he adds: "We can't have this kind of thing happen very often.
23/wsj_2386:Discount brokerage customers "have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago," says Leslie Quick Jr., chairman of the Quick & Reilly discount brokerage firm.
23/wsj_2386:Avner Arbel, a Cornell University finance professor, says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to "win back the confidence of the small investor." 
23/wsj_2386:Alan Helfman, general sales manager of a Chrysler dealership in Houston, said he and his mother have some joint stock investments, but the overall economy is his chief worry. 
23/wsj_2386:"These high rollers took a big bath today," he said in his showroom, which is within a few miles of the multi-million dollar homes of some of Houston's richest citizens. "And I can tell you that a high roller isn't going to come in tomorrow and buy a Chrysler TC by Maserati." And, finally, there were the gloaters. "I got out in 1987.
23/wsj_2387:Compaq Computer Corp. 's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market, especially Zenith Electronics Corp., the current market leader, and on a swarm of promising start-ups. 
23/wsj_2387:Compaq's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market.
23/wsj_2387:Analysts say they're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they're priced aggressively at $2,400 to $5,000.
23/wsj_2387:All of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases. 
23/wsj_2387:That can't be said of the $2,400 notepad computer introduced a few weeks ago by GRiD Systems Corp., a unit of Tandy.
23/wsj_2387:Instead of a keyboard, it features a writing surface, an electronic pen and the ability to "read" block printing.
23/wsj_2387:At 4 1/2 pounds, it may be too ambitiously named, but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth. 
23/wsj_2387:At stake is what Mike Swavely, Compaq's president of North America operations, calls "the Holy Grail of the computer industry" -- the search for "a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere." The market is so new, nobody knows yet how big it can be. "I've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is," says Tom Humphries, director of marketing for GRiD. "Whether it's $5 billion or $3.5 billion, it doesn't matter.
23/wsj_2387:Consider the growth of portables, which now comprise 12% of all personal computer sales.
23/wsj_2387:Responding to that demand, however, has led to a variety of compromises.
23/wsj_2387:It also has precluded use of the faster, more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines.
23/wsj_2387:Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers, who argue that they're too small -- a problem Poquet also encountered in focus groups, admits Gerry Purdy, director of marketing.
23/wsj_2387:Despite the sniping, few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that don't make compromises.
23/wsj_2387:Compaq's announcement also spells trouble for Zenith, which last year had 28% of the U.S. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to Cie. des Machines Bull, the French government-owned computer maker.
23/wsj_2387:John P. Frank, president of Zenith Data Systems, simply shrugs off such criticism, noting that 3 1/2-inch floppies were also "unconventional" when they first replaced five-inch disks. "We don't look at it as not being a standard, we look at it as a new standard," he argues. 
23/wsj_2387:Analysts don't see it that way. "I can't imagine that you'll talk to anyone who won't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else," says Gene Talsky, president of Professional Marketing Management Inc. Adds Bill Lempesis, senior industry analyst for DataQuest, a high-technology market research firm: "We basically think that these are very hot products.
23/wsj_2387:The problem Compaq is going to have is that they won't be able to make enough of them." 
23/wsj_2387:Compaq's machines include the 3 1/2-inch floppy disk drive, a backlit screen that is only 1/4-inch thick and an internal expansion slot for a modem -- in other words, almost all the capabilities of a typical office machine. 
23/wsj_2387:Toshiba's line of portables, for example, features the T-1000, which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory, and the T-1600, which also uses a 286 microprocessor, but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size.
23/wsj_2387:A third model, marketed in Japan, may hit the U.S. by the end of the first quarter of 1990, but by then, analysts say, Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players. 
23/wsj_2387:International Business Machines Corp., analysts say, has been burned twice in trying to enter the laptop market and shows no signs of trying to get into notebooks anytime soon. 
23/wsj_2389:Sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused Spain's September consumer price index to shoot up 1.1% from the previous month, pushing the annual rate of inflation to 6.8%, the National Institute of Statistics said Friday. 
23/wsj_2389:The index, which registered 156.8 at the end of September, has a base of 100 set in 1983 and isn't seasonally adjusted. 
23/wsj_2389:Prices have risen 5.9% in the first nine months of the year, outstripping both the initial 3% inflation goal set by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the second, revised goal of 5.8%. 
23/wsj_2390:Japan's wholesale prices in September rose 3.3% from a year earlier and were up 0.4% from the previous month, the Bank of Japan announced Friday. 
23/wsj_2390:The wholesale price index stood at 90.1, compared with a 1985 base of 100. 
23/wsj_2391:Stocks of utilities held up relatively better than other market sectors during the sell-off.
23/wsj_2391:Of course, many more issues -- 93 -- hit new lows.
23/wsj_2391:Other new lows included Navistar International Corp., Union Carbide Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp., all of which are included in the industrial average. 
23/wsj_2391:Meanwhile, two initial public offerings braved the cascading market in their maiden day of national over-the-counter trading Friday.
23/wsj_2391:Shares of Rally's Inc., an operator of fast-food restaurants, closed at $17 each, up from its $15 offering price and shares of Employee Benefit Plans Inc., a health-care consultant, closed at $14.125, up from its $12 offering price. 
23/wsj_2392:Ford Motor Co. said it acquired 5% of the shares in Jaguar PLC. Jaguar, the London Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are being notified of the transactions, the company said. 
23/wsj_2392:The U.S. Federal Trade Commission advised Ford last week that it wouldn't raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as 15% of Jaguar shares. 
23/wsj_2392:The No. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15% of the British luxury-car maker, the maximum allowed under current United Kingdom government restrictions.
23/wsj_2392:General Motors Corp. said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with Jaguar before Ford began buying shares.
23/wsj_2393:In October 1987, these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market. 
23/wsj_2393:Typically, a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75% of its original value.
23/wsj_2393:But some big brokerage firms said they don't expect major problems as a result of margin calls.
23/wsj_2393:He said Schwab had increased margin requirements "so customers have more of a cushion." He added: "We learned a lesson in 1987 about volatility." 
23/wsj_2394:Avis Inc., following rival Hertz Corp. 's lead, said it is backing out of frequent-flier programs with three airlines. 
23/wsj_2394:The Garden City, N.Y., car-rental company said it won't renew contracts with NWA Inc. 's Northwest Airlines unit, Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways unit and Midway Airlines at the end of this year.
23/wsj_2394:Industry estimates put Avis's annual cost of all five programs at between $8 million and $14 million.
23/wsj_2394:A spokesman for Avis wouldn't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for "far less than half" of the total. 
23/wsj_2394:Budget Rent a Car Corp., of Chicago, and National Car Rental Systems Inc., of Minneapolis, both said they had no plans to follow suit.
23/wsj_2394:Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements. 
23/wsj_2394:A month ago, Hertz, of Park Ridge, N.J., said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with Delta, America West and Texas Air Corp. 's Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines, and that pacts with American Airlines, UAL Inc's United Airlines and USAir also would be ended. . . sometime after Dec. 31.
23/wsj_2394:At the time, Hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $20 million and that the value of redeemed awards topped $15 million.
23/wsj_2394:Robert D. Cardillo, Avis vice president of marketing, said, "The proliferation and costs attached to {frequent-flier programs} have significantly diminished their value." 
23/wsj_2395:"I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it," said Rod Perth, who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August. "This will raise the energy level of the show." 
23/wsj_2395:The show, despite a promising start, has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co., finishing far below "Tonight" on NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., and "Nightline" on ABC-TV, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. Further fractioning the late-night audience is the addition of the "Arsenio Hall Show," syndicated by Paramount Communications Inc. 
23/wsj_2396:Tandem Computers Inc., preparing to fight with International Business Machines Corp. for a piece of the mainframe business, said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30. 
23/wsj_2396:Tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $450 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share.
23/wsj_2396:In the year-earlier period, Tandem reported net income of $30.1 million, or 31 cents a share, on revenue of $383.9 million. 
23/wsj_2396:Analysts have predicted that the Cupertino, Calif., company will report revenue of $430 million to $460 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share. 
23/wsj_2396:Commenting on the results for the quarter, Mr. Treybig said the strength of the company's domestic business came as "a surprise" to him, noting that sales "in every region of the U.S. exceeded our plan." 
23/wsj_2396:Tandem makes "fault-tolerant" computers -- machines with built-in backup systems -- that run stock exchanges, networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems.
23/wsj_2396:Tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever, which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers. 
23/wsj_2396:Analysts expect the new computer to wrest a hefty slice of business away from IBM, the longtime leader in mainframes. 
23/wsj_2396:IBM is expected to respond to Tandem's Cyclone by discounting its own mainframes, which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from Tandem. "Obviously IBM can give bigger discounts to users immediately," said Mr. Weiss. 
23/wsj_2396:But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue's machines. "The answer isn't price reductions, but new systems," he said. 
23/wsj_2396:Nevertheless, Tandem faces a variety of challenges, the biggest being that customers generally view the company's computers as complementary to IBM's mainframes.
23/wsj_2397:In one wild hour of trading, the market managed to accomplish what the Bush administration has been trying to do, unsuccessfully, for weeks.
23/wsj_2397:It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar.
23/wsj_2397:The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate American business -- indeed, the entire economy. 
23/wsj_2397:After all, until a few years ago, the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy.
23/wsj_2397:The 1987 crash was "a false alarm however you view it," says University of Chicago economist Victor Zarnowitz. 
23/wsj_2397:The market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation.
23/wsj_2397:Its spasms can't be traced to fundamental business conditions, nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy. "The market today has a life of its own," John Akers, chairman of International Business Machines Corp., said Saturday. "There's nothing rational about this kind of action." 
23/wsj_2397:Of course, the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week.
23/wsj_2397:But if the stock market doesn't continue to plummet, the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate.
23/wsj_2397:But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets. 
23/wsj_2397:The dollar also began to decline Friday as the stock market's plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the U.S. Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals, threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years.
23/wsj_2397:That wasn't the case in 1987, when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse, producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S. 
23/wsj_2397:In the third quarter of 1987, the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3%.
23/wsj_2397:The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3% in the third quarter of 1989, which ended two weeks ago. 
23/wsj_2397:The plunge in stock prices "is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down," says economist Lawrence Chimerine of WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting company. "A lot of pent-up demand is gone." 
23/wsj_2397:Consumer spending did drop in the months following Black Monday 1987 -- "but only slightly and for a short period of time," recalls Mr. Zarnowitz, a longtime student of business cycles. "That was offset by strength elsewhere. {The effects} were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected." Today, he frets, exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers retrench in reaction. 
23/wsj_2397:What's more, the corporate borrowing binge hasn't abated in the past two years. "We've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt . . . just at the time when earnings are being squeezed," Mr. Chimerine notes.
23/wsj_2397:The Fed, of course, knows that very well -- hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy this morning.
23/wsj_2397:Even before Friday's events, Harvard University economist Benjamin Friedman was arguing that the Fed won't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets, banks and highly leveraged corporations.
23/wsj_2397:The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now isn't recession, he reasons; it's an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation. 
23/wsj_2397:The economy does, however, depend on the confidence of businesses, consumers and foreign investors.
23/wsj_2397:A 190-point drop isn't likely to make much of a dent; multiply that a few times over, though, and it will.
23/wsj_2397:If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at Hot Springs, Va., for the Business Council meetings are typical, business leaders weren't overly rattled by Friday's decline.
23/wsj_2397:Two years ago, about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent Depression.
23/wsj_2398:The chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of skidding prices in the commodity end of the business. 
23/wsj_2398:Producers of commodity chemicals, the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers, have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers.
23/wsj_2398:Once the chief beneficiaries of the industry's now fading boom, these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the 1988 third quarter. 
23/wsj_2398:"For some of these companies, this will be the first quarter with year-to-year negative comparisons," says Leonard Bogner, a chemical industry analyst at Prudential Bache Research. "This could be the first of five or six down quarters." 
23/wsj_2398:Perhaps most prominent, Dow Chemical Co., which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters, is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier, if only by a shade.
23/wsj_2398:Analysts' third-quarter estimates for the Midland, Mich., company are between $3.20 a share and $3.30 a share, compared with $3.36 a year ago, when profit was $632 million on sales of $4.15 billion.
23/wsj_2398:At the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., the commodity-chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for 20 companies representative of the whole industry by 8% to 10%. "You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better," says James Wilbur, a Smith Barney analyst. 
23/wsj_2398:First Boston Corp. projects that 10 of the 15 companies it follows will report lower profit.
23/wsj_2398:Most of the 10 have big commodity-chemical operations. 
23/wsj_2398:Still, some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains, largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals.
23/wsj_2398:Analysts are divided over whether Du Pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its Conoco Inc. oil company.
23/wsj_2398:In the 1988 third quarter, the company earned $461 million, or $1.91 a share, on sales of $7.99 billion.
23/wsj_2398:Monsanto Co., too, is expected to continue reporting higher profit, even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern Europe and the western U.S.
23/wsj_2398:Searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year, but Monsanto has said it expects Searle to post a profit for all of 1989. 
23/wsj_2398:A year ago, the company posted third-quarter profit of $116 million, or $1.67 a share, on sales of $2.02 billion.
23/wsj_2398:But the commodity-chemical producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle.
23/wsj_2398:The projections are in the neighborhood of 50 cents a share to 75 cents, compared with a restated $1.65 a share a year earlier, when profit was $107.8 million on sales of $435.5 million. 
23/wsj_2398:At Quantum Chemical Corp., New York, the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene, higher debt costs and the idling of an important plant due to an explosion.
23/wsj_2398:In the 1988 third quarter, Quantum earned $99.8 million, or $3.92 a share, on sales of $724.4 million. 
23/wsj_2398:Another big polyethylene producer, Union Carbide Corp., is expected to post profit of between $1 a share and $1.25, compared with $1.56 a share a year earlier, when the company earned $213 million on sales of $2.11 billion. 
23/wsj_2399:Dow Chemical Co. -- $150 million of 8.55% senior notes due Oct. 15, 2009, priced at par.
23/wsj_2399:The issue, which is puttable back to the company at par on Oct. 15, 1999, was priced at a spread of 50 basis points above the Treasury's 10-year note.
23/wsj_2399:Centel Capital Corp. -- $150 million of 9% debentures due Oct. 15, 2019, priced at 99.943 to yield 9.008%.
23/wsj_2399:Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. -- $500 million of Remic mortgage securities offered in 13 classes by Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
23/wsj_2399:The offering, Series 102, backed by Freddie Mac 8 1/2% securities with a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 28.4 years, was priced before the market's afternoon surge.
23/wsj_2399:Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. -- $300 million of Remic mortgage securities offered by Citicorp Securities Markets Inc.
23/wsj_2399:Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. -- $200 million of stripped mortgage securities underwritten by BT Securities Corp.
23/wsj_2399:Freddie Mac said the principal-only securities were priced at 58 1/4 to yield 8.45%, assuming an average life of eight years and a prepayment of 160% of the PSA model.
24/wsj_2400:The trade gap is expected to widen to about $9 billion from July's $7.6 billion, according to a survey by MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York. 
24/wsj_2400:"There's a possibility of a surprise" in the trade report, said Michael Englund, director of research at MMS.
24/wsj_2400:A widening of the deficit, if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar, would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted. 
24/wsj_2400:Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations.
24/wsj_2400:The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences: The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5% to an increase of 0.4%, according to MMS. 
24/wsj_2400:He expects a gain of as much as 0.5% in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases. 
24/wsj_2400:Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from August's annual pace of 1,350,000 units.
24/wsj_2402:Assuming the stock market doesn't crash again and completely discredit yuppies and trading rooms, American television audiences in a few months may be seeing Britain's concept of both. "Capital City" is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer, Thames Television. 
24/wsj_2402:The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of 1987.
24/wsj_2402:According to the program's publicity prospectus, "Capital City," set at Shane Longman, a fictional mid-sized securities firm with #500 million capital, "follows the fortunes of a close-knit team of young, high-flying dealers, hired for their particular blend of style, genius and energy.
24/wsj_2402:But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well; pressure to pull off another million before lunch; pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second . . ." 
24/wsj_2402:You needn't be a high-powered securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure.
24/wsj_2402:The slickly produced series has been criticized by London's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail, but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters' professional and private lives. 
24/wsj_2402:So much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second.
24/wsj_2402:And a large slice of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds (since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays?).
24/wsj_2402:Surprisingly, Shane Longman survives the week, only to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation.
24/wsj_2402:Instead of closing ranks to protect the firm's reputation, the executive's internal rivals, led by a loutish American, demand his resignation.
24/wsj_2402:The plot is thwarted when the firm's major stockholder, kelp farming on the other side of the globe, hurries home to support the executive.
24/wsj_2402:If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six-figure salaries, you still are left puzzled, because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously.
24/wsj_2402:In fact, few consume much of anything.
24/wsj_2402:Two share a house almost devoid of furniture.
24/wsj_2402:Michelle lives in a hotel room, and although she drives a canary-colored Porsche, she hasn't time to clean or repair it; the beat-up vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock.
24/wsj_2402:And it takes Declan, the obligatory ladies' man of the cast, until the third episode to get past first base with any of his prey. 
24/wsj_2402:This attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of Max, the trading room's most flamboyant character.
24/wsj_2402:But apparently to make him palatable, even lovable, to the masses, the script inflates pony-tailed Max into an eccentric genius, master of 11 Chinese dialects.
24/wsj_2402:The production costs are a not inconsiderable #8 million ($12.4 million), and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of "Dealers," an earlier made-for-TV movie.
24/wsj_2402:Another half million quid went for a volley of full-page advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge posters in the London subway. 
24/wsj_2402:These expenses create a special incentive for "Capital City's" producers to flog it, or a Yank-oriented version of it, in America.
24/wsj_2402:Perhaps without realizing it, Mr. Taffner simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution: "Capital City" should have been a comedy, a worthy sequel to the screwball British "Carry On" movies of the 1960s. 
24/wsj_2402:The first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading-room crew minded a baby, the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm.
24/wsj_2402:Joanna Kanska looks like a young Zsa Zsa Gabor; William Armstrong, who plays Max, could pass for Hans Conreid, and Douglas Hodge (Declan) for James Farentino; Rolf Saxon is a passable Tommy Noonan and Dorian Healy could easily double for Huntz Hall, the blank-faced foil of the Bowery Boys comedies. 
24/wsj_2403:Axa-Midi Assurances of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $4.5 billion acquisition of Farmers Group Inc., in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. states where Farmers operates. 
24/wsj_2403:The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC, the British tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles-based Farmers.
24/wsj_2403:In an attempt to appease U.S. regulators' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers, Sir James in August agreed to sell Farmers to Axa if he is successful in acquiring B.A.T. 
24/wsj_2403:As part of the agreement, Axa agreed to invest $1 billion in Hoylake Investments Ltd., Sir James's acquisition vehicle. 
24/wsj_2403:Of the total $5.5 billion to be paid to Hoylake by Axa, about $1 billion will come from available resources of Axa's parent, Axa-Midi Group, $2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by Axa, and the remaining $2.25 billion will be in long-term bank loans. 
24/wsj_2403:In an interview Thursday, Claude Bebear, chairman and chief executive officer of Axa, said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by Cie.
24/wsj_2403:Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing.
24/wsj_2403:Mr. Bebear said Axa-Midi Group has "more than $2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell" to help pay off debt from the acquisition.
24/wsj_2403:He said the assets to be sold would be "non-insurance" assets, including a beer company and a real estate firm, and wouldn't include any pieces of Farmers. "We won't put any burden on Farmers," he said. 
24/wsj_2403:The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement, Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T. "We hope that with what we did, the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake, and they can directly look at the agreement with us, because Hoylake won't be an owner of Farmers at anytime," Mr. Bebear said. 
24/wsj_2403:Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated. 
24/wsj_2403:The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake, and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition.
24/wsj_2403:Hoylake dropped its initial #13.35 billion ($20.71 billion) takeover bid after it received the extension, but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval. 
24/wsj_2403:A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that, "It would appear that nothing substantive has changed.
24/wsj_2403:The new financing structure is still a very-highly leveraged one, and Axa still plans to take out 75% of Farmers' earnings as dividends to service their debt." That dividend is almost double the 35% currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T, the spokesman added. "It would have severe implications for Farmers' policy holders." 
24/wsj_2404:Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early October, the first sales period of the 1990 model year. 
24/wsj_2404:The eight major domestic auto makers sold 160,510 North American-made cars in the first 10 days of October, a 12.6% drop from a year earlier.
24/wsj_2404:The heavy use of incentives to clear out 1989 models appears to have taken the steam, at least initially, out of 1990 model sales, which began officially Oct. 1.
24/wsj_2404:Overall, sales of all domestic-made vehicles fell 11.9% from a year ago.
24/wsj_2404:Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models, but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up. "We've created a condition where, without incentives, it's a tough market," said Tom Kelly, sales manager for Bill Wink Chevrolet in Dearborn, Mich. 
24/wsj_2404:Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles, the lowest since October 1987.
24/wsj_2404:The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month.
24/wsj_2404:Furthermore, dealers contacted late last week said they couldn't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday's steep market decline. 
24/wsj_2404:All of the GM divisions except Cadillac showed big declines.
24/wsj_2404:Cadillac posted a 3.2% increase despite new competition from Lexus, the fledging luxury-car division of Toyota Motor Corp. Lexus sales weren't available; the cars are imported and Toyota reports their sales only at month-end. 
24/wsj_2404:The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered in addition to consumer rebates and low-interest financing, a company spokesman said.
24/wsj_2404:However, sales of trucks, including the company's popular minivans, rose 4.3%. 
24/wsj_2404:Honda Motor Co. 's sales of domestically built vehicles plunged 21.7% from a year earlier.
24/wsj_2404:Separately, Chrysler said firm prices on its 1990-model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5% over comparably equipped 1989 models.
24/wsj_2405:Antonio L. Savoca, 66 years old, was named president and chief executive officer of the Atlantic Research Corp. subsidiary.
24/wsj_2406:It wasn't so long ago that a radio network funded by the U.S. Congress -- and originally by the Central Intelligence Agency -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists, imperialists and spies.
24/wsj_2406:"I think this is a victory for the radio," says Barnabas de Bueky, a 55-year-old former Hungarian refugee who works in the Munich, West Germany, headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service.
24/wsj_2406:In fact, Radio Free Europe is in danger of suffering from its success. 
24/wsj_2406:Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism, Radio Free Europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame, even boring. 
24/wsj_2406:Indeed, Hungary is in the midst of a media explosion.
24/wsj_2406:Boys on busy street corners peddle newspapers of every political stripe.
24/wsj_2406:Newsstands are packed with a colorful array of magazines.
24/wsj_2406:The British Broadcasting Corp. and the U.S. State Department's Voice of America broadcast over Hungarian airwaves, though only a few hours a day each in Hungarian.
24/wsj_2406:With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way, the network's staff says it still has plenty to do -- in Hungary and in the "Great Eastern Beyond." Radio Free Europe and its sister station for the Soviet Union, Radio Liberty, say they won't cut back their more than 19 hours of daily broadcasts.
24/wsj_2406:They are still an important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues: from Bulgarian and Belorussian to Kazakh and Kirghiz. 
24/wsj_2406:The establishment of its first bureau in Warsaw Pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in Eastern Europe.
24/wsj_2406:Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe's new location, but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing: "They found us four phone lines in central Budapest," says Geza Szocs, a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location. "That is a miracle." 
24/wsj_2406:It's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network, which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents (who filed reports to the network by phone, secret messengers or letters).
24/wsj_2406:In fact, some of the network's Hungarian listeners say they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the "Dark Ages of the 20th Century." 
24/wsj_2406:"During the past four years, many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios," says the writer. "There were some very brave broadcasts." 
24/wsj_2406:Through much of the post-World War II period, listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in Hungary. "When we listen to the Europe station, my mother still gets nervous," says a Budapest translator. "She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains." 
24/wsj_2406:Television, which most of the time is considered rather tame, has entered the running with a new program, "The End of the Day," which comes on after 11 p.m.
24/wsj_2406:The Hungarian service has a daily 40-minute news show called Newsreel, with international and domestic news, plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world. 
24/wsj_2406:There's also a host of new programs, trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics.
24/wsj_2406:A daily 35-minute program called "The March of Time" tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world.
24/wsj_2407:Proposals for government-operated "national service," like influenza, flare up from time to time, depress the resistance of the body politic, run their course, and seem to disappear, only to mutate and afflict public life anew. 
24/wsj_2407:The disease metaphor comes to mind, of course, not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service.
24/wsj_2407:Rather, it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s, along with smallpox. 
24/wsj_2407:It is back with us again, in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a "National and Community Service Act," a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall. 
24/wsj_2407:If only we could get America's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self-discipline again and revive the spirit of giving. 
24/wsj_2407:A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by, of all things, expanding the draft.
24/wsj_2407:Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many national-service backers, despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion. 
24/wsj_2407:Choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to doom national service as much as the draft.
24/wsj_2407:But the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago, when it again was let loose.
24/wsj_2407:This time it attempted to invade two connected problems, the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans.
24/wsj_2407:Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants, the advocates reasoned, but require some form of service from each recipient?
24/wsj_2407:Thus, undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious, infecting patriotic conservatives, pay-as-you-go moderates, and idealistic liberals.
24/wsj_2407:A provision allowing grants to be applied to first-home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling. 
24/wsj_2407:With a tax-free $10,000 voucher payment at the end of each year, the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $17,500 a year.
24/wsj_2407:Mind you, most of "the volunteers" would be unskilled 17- to 18-year-olds, some not even high school graduates, and many saving money by living at home.
24/wsj_2407:They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families. 
24/wsj_2407:As it happened, political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system, so the national-service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of "give in order to get." Opposition to national service from the Pentagon, which wants to protect its own recruitment process, also led to the military-service option being dropped. 
24/wsj_2407:What better place to turn than Sen. Edward Kennedy's Labor Committee, that great stove of government expansionism, where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine? 
24/wsj_2407:In this case, the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle: a demonstration project for educational aid (particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn), a similar demonstration program for youth conservation (a la Sen. Chris Dodd), a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects (a Kennedy specialty), a community service work-study program for students (pleasing to the palate of Sen. Dale Bumpers, among others), plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer, Foster Grandparent, and Senior Companion programs.
24/wsj_2407:It is widely known that "too many cooks spoil the broth," but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks, especially if they are senators.
24/wsj_2407:The "omnibus" bill coming out of Congress may be unwholesome glop, but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard.
24/wsj_2407:The aroma of patronage is in the air. 
24/wsj_2407:According to the Gallup Poll, American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service, while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30% (adjusted for inflation). 
24/wsj_2407:If we want to support students, we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called "scholarship," rather than on the government's idea of "service." Or we might provide a tax credit for working students.
24/wsj_2407:Polls show wide, generalized support for some vague concept of service, but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing.
24/wsj_2407:Nonetheless, Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting "associations," "societies" and "councils," some of which may hope to receive the paid "volunteers." 
24/wsj_2407:So far, the president seems ill-disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free-standing proposal to endow a "Points of Light" foundation with $25 million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism. 
24/wsj_2407:However, even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in "brokering" federal funds for volunteer projects. 
24/wsj_2407:National service, the utopian idea, still won't go away then, of course, but the millions of knee-socked youth performing works of "civic content" will be mobilized only in the imagination of their progenitors. 
24/wsj_2408:Drug Emporium Inc. said Gary Wilber, 39 years old, who had been president and chief operating officer for the past year, was named chief executive officer of this drugstore chain. 
24/wsj_2409:American Physicians Service Group Inc. said it purchased about 42% of Prime Medical Services Inc. for about $5 million from Texas American Energy Corp. 
24/wsj_2409:American provides a variety of financial services to doctors and hospitals.
24/wsj_2409:For the year ended June 30, Prime had a net loss of $3 million on sales of $13.8 million. 
24/wsj_2410:The inflation-adjusted growth rate for France's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8% from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7%, the National Statistics Institute said. 
24/wsj_2410:If the economy continues to expand by 0.8% a quarter for the rest of the year, it would leave GDP growth for all of 1989 at 3%, the institute said.
24/wsj_2411:The annual interest rate for each of the next 11 years will be set each fall, when details of a new series are released. 
24/wsj_2411:The government has about 41.4 billion Canadian dollars (US$35.2 billion) of such bonds currently outstanding. 
24/wsj_2412:After a decade in which more than 50 localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a prerequisite to high-school graduation, the focus has shifted to Washington. 
24/wsj_2412:Claiborne Pell, Barbara Mikulski and Christopher Dodd, has been reported out of the Senate Labor Committee.
24/wsj_2412:What is one to think of all this?
24/wsj_2412:So do those who seek a "re-energized concept of citizenship," a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights.
24/wsj_2412:To libertarians, mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money.
24/wsj_2412:Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform: If the market won't pay for it, they argue, it can't be worth its cost.
24/wsj_2412:Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed; they see service as a cover for the draft, or fear the regimentation of youth, or want to see rights enlarged, not obligations. 
24/wsj_2412:But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology?
24/wsj_2412:Let's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion -- "national service" has no agreed meaning.
24/wsj_2412:What kinds of work would they do? 
24/wsj_2412:Those are not trivial questions, and the label "national service" answers none of them.
24/wsj_2412:But the earnings exceed by 20% the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs.
24/wsj_2412:It is also unwise and unenforceable. (Who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year?) But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior.
24/wsj_2412:Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S., should build on the service programs already in existence, and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing. 
24/wsj_2412:There is important work to be done, and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not cheaply. 
24/wsj_2412:Good service programs require recruitment, screening, training and supervision -- all of high quality.
24/wsj_2412:People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve, but there are many ways for middle-class kids, and their elders, to serve at little public cost.
24/wsj_2412:They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions, or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers. 
24/wsj_2412:But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service. 
24/wsj_2412:But they believe themselves to be serving, and they begin to respect themselves (and others), to take control of their lives, to think of the future.
24/wsj_2412:He is a co-author of "National Service: What Would It Mean?" (Lexington Books, 1986). 
24/wsj_2413:Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet. 
24/wsj_2413:Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones, making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987, if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis. 
24/wsj_2413:"The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis," said one government official, insisting on anonymity. 
24/wsj_2413:Nevertheless, Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank's game plan.
24/wsj_2413:The reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard Darman on ABC's "This Week." "Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact.
24/wsj_2413:At the Treasury, Secretary Brady issued a statement minimizing the stock market's drop. "Today's stock market decline doesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy," he said. "The economy remains well-balanced, and the outlook is for continued moderate growth." 
24/wsj_2413:But administration officials conceded that Friday's drop carried the chance of further declines this week. "One possibility is that this is a surgical setback, reasonably limited in its breadth, and not a major problem," said one senior administration official, who also asked that he not be named. "The other is that we see another major disaster, like two years ago.
24/wsj_2413:The action was expected to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe.
24/wsj_2413:He was quickly on the phone with Mr. Mullins, who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago exchanges.
24/wsj_2413:He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr. Brady and Michael Boskin, chairman of the counsel of economic advisers. 
24/wsj_2413:Government officials tried throughout the weekend to render a business-as-usual appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic.
24/wsj_2413:Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford, for instance, was at a meeting of the Business Council in Hot Springs, Va., when the stock market fell, and remained there through the following day.
24/wsj_2413:And as of last night, Fed Chairman Greenspan hadn't canceled his plans to address the American Bankers Association convention in Washington at 10 a.m. this morning. 
24/wsj_2413:(See related story: "Abreast of the Market: Special Steps Didn't Cool Fever to Sell" -- WSJ Oct. 16, 1989) 
24/wsj_2414:Following is a weekly listing of unadited net asset values of publicly traded investment fund shares, reported by the companies as of Friday's close.
24/wsj_2414:Also shown is the closing listed market price or a dealer-to-dealer asked price of each fund's shares, with the percentage of difference. 
24/wsj_2414:b-As of Thursday's close. c-Translated at Commercial Rand exchange rate. e-In Canadian dollars. f-As of Wednesday's close. g-10.06.89 NAV:22.15. z-Not available. 
24/wsj_2415:That's the advice of most investment professionals after Friday's 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
24/wsj_2415:Investors who sold everything after the crash of 1987 lived to regret it.
24/wsj_2415:The crash of 1929 was followed by a substantial recovery before the great Depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began.
24/wsj_2415:The "October massacres" of 1978 and 1979 were scary, but didn't lead to severe or sustained downturns. 
24/wsj_2415:Indeed, some pros see Friday's plunge, plus any further damage that might occur early this week, as a chance for bargain hunting. "There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you've got the cash," says Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc. 
24/wsj_2415:Even for people who expect a bear market in coming months -- and a sizable number of money managers and market pundits do -- the advice is: Wait for the market to bounce back, and sell shares gradually during rallies.
24/wsj_2415:The best thing individual investors can do is "just sit tight," says Marshall B. Front, executive vice president and head of investment counseling at Stein Roe & Farnham Inc., a Chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $18 billion. 
24/wsj_2415:Roger Ibbotson, professor of finance at Yale University and head of the market information firm Ibbotson Associates Inc., says, "My real advice would be to just ride through it.
24/wsj_2415:Generally, it isn't wise to be in and out" of the stock market. 
24/wsj_2415:John Snyder, former president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Association of Investors Corp., an organization of investment clubs and individual investors, says his fellow club members didn't sell in the crash of 1987, and see no reason to sell now. "We're dedicated long-term investors, not traders," he says. "We understand panics and euphoria.
24/wsj_2415:And we hope to take advantage of panics and buy stocks when they plunge." 
24/wsj_2415:One camp of investment pros sees what happened Friday as an opportunity.
24/wsj_2415:Friday's action "was an old-fashioned panic," says Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis for A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "Stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price." His advice: "You ought to be there with a basket catching them." 
24/wsj_2415:James Craig, portfolio manager for the Denver-based Janus Fund, which has one of the industry's better track records, started his buying during Friday's plunge.
24/wsj_2415:He argues that stocks are reasonably valued now, and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of 1987. 
24/wsj_2415:Mr. Front of Stein Roe suggests that any buying should "concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side, or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction." His firm favors selected computer, drug and pollution-control stocks. 
24/wsj_2415:Many of them stress that the selling can be orderly, gradual, and done when stock prices are rallying. 
24/wsj_2415:So he thinks the government will err on the side of rekindled inflation. 
24/wsj_2415:David M. Jones, vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., recommends Treasury securities (of up to five years' maturity).
24/wsj_2415:Whether this insurance is worthwhile depends on the cost of an option.
24/wsj_2415:The cost, or premium, tends to get fat in times of crisis.
24/wsj_2415:The prices of puts generally didn't soar Friday.
24/wsj_2415:For example, the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on Eli Lilly & Co. moved up from 3% at Thursday's close to only 3.3% at Friday's close, even though the shares dropped more than $5.50.
24/wsj_2415:But investors should keep in mind, before paying too much, that the average annual return for stock holdings, long-term, is 9% to 10% a year; a return of 15% is considered praiseworthy.
24/wsj_2415:Paying, say, 10% for insurance against losses takes a deep bite out of the return. 
24/wsj_2416:Coldwell Banker Commercial Group said it sold $47 million of common stock to its employees at $10 a share, giving them a total stake of more than 40% in the commercial real estate brokerage firm. 
24/wsj_2416:The firm, which was acquired in April from Sears, Roebuck & Co. in a management-led buy-out, had planned to sell up to $56.4 million of stock, or a 50% stake in the company, to its 5,000 employees. 
24/wsj_2416:Though the offering didn't sell out, James J. Didion, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We're pretty proud of the employees' response." He noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan, where a company usually borrows money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time, here employees had to fork out their own cash for the stock. "They came up with their own money instead of borrowed money," Mr. Didion said. "It's totally different." 
24/wsj_2416:They may also eventually sell the shares to third parties, but the outside investors who own the remaining 60% of Coldwell Banker have the right to first refusal. 
24/wsj_2416:Those outside investors in Coldwell Banker include Carlyle Group, a closely held Washington, D.C., merchant banking firm whose co-chairman is Frank Carlucci, former secretary of defense; Frederic V. Malek, senior adviser to Carlyle Group; Mellon Family Trust of Pittsburgh; Westinghouse Credit Corp., the financial services unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp.; Bankers Trust Co., a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp.; and a group of Japanese investors represented by the investment banking unit of Tokyo-based Sumitomo Bank.
24/wsj_2416:The nominees are Gary Wilson, chief financial officer of Walt Disney Co.; James Montgomery, chief executive officer of Great Western Financial Corp.; and Peter Ubberroth, former commissioner of baseball and now a private investor. 
24/wsj_2417:The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange, which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the Merc. 
24/wsj_2417:That early-morning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted after the 1987 crash.
24/wsj_2417:Several of those post-crash changes kicked in during Friday's one-hour collapse and worked as expected, even though they didn't prevent a stunning plunge.
24/wsj_2417:A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other, more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash.
24/wsj_2417:Most notably, several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force, which analyzed the 1987 crash, would be revived -- especially because that group's chairman is now the Treasury secretary.
24/wsj_2417:The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions, such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets. 
24/wsj_2417:Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc's Standard & Poor's 500 contract, as well as "hot-line" communications among exchanges.
24/wsj_2417:Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels. 
24/wsj_2417:One observer estimated that 80% to 90% of the S&P traders "were just standing around watching." 
24/wsj_2417:But the 250-point circuit breaker never had to kick in, and freezes on the Chicago Board of Trade's Major Market Index also weren't triggered.
24/wsj_2417:The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the 1987 crash. 
24/wsj_2417:The process of post-crash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments. 
24/wsj_2417:In October 1987, just after the market drop, Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated.
24/wsj_2417:Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions.
24/wsj_2417:There were also calls to strip the stock markets of "derivative" products, such as stock-index futures and options, which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin, for example, likened to "barnacles attached to the basic market." And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange's system of having stock trades flow through specialists, or market makers. 
24/wsj_2417:When the Brady Task Force's powerful analysis of the crash was released in January 1988, it immediately reshaped the reformers' agenda.
24/wsj_2417:Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one, and concluding that the crash had "raised the possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown," the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets, to make margins consistent across markets, to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers. 
24/wsj_2417:Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented.
24/wsj_2417:The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies.
24/wsj_2417:In May 1988, the Working Group, made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finally endorsed only circuit breakers. 
24/wsj_2417:After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets, circuit breakers were set in place, with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
24/wsj_2417:-- Require prompt reports of large securities trades. 
24/wsj_2417:-- Give SEC authority to monitor risk-taking by affiliates of brokerage firms. 
24/wsj_2417:-- Create a task force to review current state of the securities markets and securities laws. 
24/wsj_2417:"There must not be a monopoly, there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers," Nikolai I. Lutsenko, the president of the Nika TV company, told the weekly newspaper Nedelya.
24/wsj_2417:Nedelya's article was accompanied by a picture of Mr. Lutsenko interviewing singer John Denver in Colorado. 
24/wsj_2417:Even though it will be independent of official television, Nika will have an oversight board that will include members of the Communist youth league. 
24/wsj_2417:South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers said that about 10,000 diamond miners struck for higher wages at De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. De Beers said that workers at five of the group's mines were on strike, which it said was peaceful, with orderly picketing occurring at one of the mines.
24/wsj_2417:Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary general of the Socialist Party, acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had received donations from the pachinko association totaling 8 million yen (about $55,000) but said the donations were legal and none of its members acted to favor the industry. 
24/wsj_2417:A report by the conservation group presented at the U.N.-sponsored Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Lausanne accused the four of trading protected species ranging from parakeets to orchids.
24/wsj_2417:Fund official Simon Lyster said world trade in wildlife was estimated to total $5 billion of business annually. 
24/wsj_2417:A NATO project to build a frigate for the 1990s was torpedoed by the pull-out of three of its eight participating nations.
24/wsj_2417:Britain, France and Italy announced technical reasons for withdrawing, but some officials pointed to growing reluctance among the allies to commit themselves to big defense spending while East-West disarmament talks show signs of success. 
24/wsj_2417:The official China Daily said retail prices of non-staple foods haven't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down.
24/wsj_2417:The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan ($270 million) was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies. 
24/wsj_2417:The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to "become very unreasonable" and reduce needed funds for investment in the "already difficult state budget." 
24/wsj_2417:The aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic growth, which soared to 20.7% last year, to 8% in 1990.
24/wsj_2417:In a sign of growing official tolerance for religion, Russian Orthodox priests were allowed to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Moscow patriarchate in the Kremlin's 15th-century Uspensky Cathedral, where czars were crowned. . . . A 34-foot-tall, $7.7 million statue of Buddha was completed on a hill outside Hong Kong, facing China.
24/wsj_2417:The statue is the brainchild of Sik Chi Wan, director of the Po Lin Monastery, who said: "Hong Kong is such a prosperous place, we also need some kind of religious symbol." 
24/wsj_2418:Replied a Justin salesman: "Exactly." The Justin merchandise carried wholesale prices some 40% below those of Sony Corp. of Japan's "My First Sony" line.
24/wsj_2418:But instead of a new customer -- part of a hoped-for bonanza from underselling Sony -- Justin got a costly legal morass.
24/wsj_2418:Seeking to keep Justin's "My Own" product line off the U.S. market, Sony last May filed a suit in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement, unfair competition and other violations of business law. 
24/wsj_2418:Since then, life has changed a lot for 61-year-old Leonard Kaye, Justin's owner. "I haven't been able to get a decent night's sleep since this has been going on," he says. "It's the most distracting thing in my life -- I can't even attend to my business." His company (annual sales: about $25 million) may suffer a costly blow -- losing an estimated 10% of total sales -- if Sony (annual sales: about $16 billion) prevails.
24/wsj_2418:Justin's plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful multinational. 
24/wsj_2418:"The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants to stop it," says Lewis H. Eslinger, Sony's attorney, who previously guarded Rubik's Cube. (Sony itself declines to comment.) If Sony wins, Mr. Eslinger says, its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas.
24/wsj_2418:Today, U.S. Judge John E. Sprizzo is expected to rule on Sony's renewed request for a pre-trial order blocking sale of the disputed products, on which deliveries began in July.
24/wsj_2418:Justin has been profitable since 1986, adds the official, who shares his office with numerous teddy bears, all samples from his line of plush toys. 
24/wsj_2418:Like many others, Mr. Kaye took notice in 1987 when Sony, in a classic example of market segmentation, changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children.
24/wsj_2418:The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models. (In court papers, Sony says it has spent more than $3 million to promote the line, with resulting sales of over a million units.) 
24/wsj_2418:Sony found a new market niche, but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor.
24/wsj_2418:His products aren't exact copies of Sony's but strongly resemble them in size, shape and, especially, color.
24/wsj_2418:Sony uses mostly red and blue, with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin, on the theory that kids prefer these colors. ("To be successful, a product can be any color whatsoever, as long as it is fire-engine red," says Charles E. Baxley, Justin's attorney.) 
24/wsj_2418:Sony's lawyer insists that the company's tactics -- including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer -- are routine in such matters.
24/wsj_2418:Of Sony, Mr. Kaye says: "They know there's no way for them to lose.
24/wsj_2419:@ Charles H. Tenney II, chairman of Unitil Corp., purchased 34,602 shares, or 4.9%, of Unitil's common, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

24/wsj_2420:The terms of the offer put a value of 528 million francs ($81.6 million) on the 32.99% shareholding. 
24/wsj_2420:The Societe Generale banking group controls 18.2% of the shareholding, while Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. owns 9.69% and Financiere Tradition, a holding company, owns 5.1%. 
24/wsj_2421:Mexican investor Joel Rocha Garza said he sold a block of 600,000 shares of Smith Laboratories Inc. common stock to companies affiliated with him. 
24/wsj_2421:Mr. Rocha Garza said that he, Clarendon Group Ltd., Biscayne, Lahus II, and Lahus III are all affiliated and hold a combined stake of 1,234,100 shares, or 9.33%.
24/wsj_2421:In San Diego, Smith Laboratories President Timothy Wollaeger said the transfer of the shares isn't significant. 
24/wsj_2422:Investcorp, New York, said it and the management of Sports & Recreation Inc. bought the operator of the 10-store Sports Unlimited chain for some $40 million. 
24/wsj_2422:The investment bank becomes majority shareholder in Sports & Recreation, a 10-year-old sporting goods retailer, said Oliver E. Richardson, a member of Investcorp's management committee and a director of the chain. 
24/wsj_2422:Sports Unlimited, Tampa, Fla., posted revenue of $59 million for the year ended July 31.
24/wsj_2422:In 1982, Sports & Recreation's managers and certain passive investors purchased the company from Brunswick Corp. of Skokie, Ill.
24/wsj_2423:Hammond Co., Newport Beach, Calif., said Fidelity National Financial Inc. extended its previous agreement, under which it won't purchase any more of the mortgage banker's common stock, through Oct. 31. 
24/wsj_2424:Giant Group Ltd. said it terminated negotiations for the purchase of Aspen Airways, a Denver-based regional carrier that operates the United Express connector service under contract to UAL Corp. 's United Airlines. 
24/wsj_2424:Giant, a Beverly Hills, Calif., collection of companies that is controlled by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman, didn't give a reason for halting its plan to acquire the airline, and Aspen officials couldn't be reached for comment. 
24/wsj_2424:The airline would have become the latest in a peculiar blend of Giant companies, which are involved in making cement, recycling newsprint and operating fast-food restaurants. 
24/wsj_2425:The state-controlled insurer Assurances Generales de France said it has obtained regulatory approval to increase its stake in the financial holding company Cie. de Navigation Mixte above 10% from the current level of about 8%. 
24/wsj_2426:Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., a unit of Lockheed Corp., said it agreed to join with Aermacchi S.p.
24/wsj_2426:A. of Varese, Italy, to propose a new generation of jet trainers for the U.S. Air Force. 
24/wsj_2426:The Air Force is looking to buy 540 new primary jet trainers, with a total value of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, between 1994 and 2004.
24/wsj_2426:The aircraft would replace the T-37, made by the Cessna Aircraft Co. unit of General Dynamics Corp., which the Air Force uses to train jet pilots.
24/wsj_2426:Lockheed said the U.S. Navy may also buy an additional 340 trainer aircraft to replace its T34C trainers made by the Beech Aircraft Corp. unit of Raytheon Corp. 
24/wsj_2426:Lockheed will build additional structures and perform final assembly of the tandem-seat trainer at its Marietta, Ga., plant should the Air Force order the craft. 
24/wsj_2426:A Lockheed spokesman in Burbank, Calif., said he wasn't aware of which other companies would be competing for the Air Force contract. 
24/wsj_2427:Striking auto workers ended their 19-day occupation of a metal shop at a Peugeot S.A. factory in eastern France Friday as pay talks got under way in the capital. 
24/wsj_2427:The Peugeot metalworkers began filing out of the shop, which makes auto parts, at the plant in Mulhouse after voting 589 to 193 to abandon the occupation. 
24/wsj_2427:The strike by customs officers, tax collectors, treasury workers and other civil servants attached to the Ministry of Finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average Frenchman.
24/wsj_2427:Ministry employees complain that they are poorly paid because of a complex job-rating system they say fails to take into account their education and level of technical expertise. 
24/wsj_2428:The market for $200 billion of high-risk junk bonds, battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year, practically vanished Friday. 
24/wsj_2428:"The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids, only offers," says independent investor Martin D. Sass, who manages nearly $4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund.
24/wsj_2428:Junk's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19, 1987, crash.
24/wsj_2428:But "an eerie silence pervaded" the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite "no active trading," says John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
24/wsj_2428:For example, the price of Southland Corp. 's $500 million of 16 3/4% bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman, Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25% to just 30 cents on the dollar.
24/wsj_2428:But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of Southland, the owner of the nationwide chain of 7-11 convenience stores that is strapped for cash.
24/wsj_2428:Junk bonds, which mushroomed from less than $2 billion at the start of this decade, have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments.
24/wsj_2428:Now, dozens of corporations, including Ethan Allen, TW Services and York International, that are counting on at least $7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat, may never get the money. "The music has stopped playing," says Michael Harkins, a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins. "You've either got a chair or you don't." 
24/wsj_2428:In Friday's aftermath, says R. Douglas Carleton, a director of high-yield finance at First Boston Corp., "much of the $7 billion forward calendar could be deferred, depending on the hysteria." In August, First Boston withdrew a $475 million junk offering of Ohio Mattress bonds because potential buyers were "very skittish." 
24/wsj_2428:The outlook "looks shaky because we're still waiting" for mutual funds, in particular, to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors, says King Penniman, senior vice president at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services.
24/wsj_2428:Indeed, a Moody's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day Friday. 
24/wsj_2428:In a stark contrast, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1/2 points, or about $25 for each $1,000 face amount, to 103 12/32, its biggest gain of the year.
24/wsj_2428:The yield on three-month Treasury bills, considered the safest of all investments, plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to 7.16%, the largest one-day decline since 1982. 
24/wsj_2428:Nevertheless, the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the months ahead. "This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook," says William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York. 
24/wsj_2428:Robert Dow, a partner and portfolio manager at Lord, Abbett & Co., which manages $4 billion of high-yield bonds, says he doesn't "think there is any fundamental economic rationale {for the junk bond rout}.
24/wsj_2428:Even as trading in high-yield issues dried up over the past month, corporations sold more than $2 billion of new junk bonds.
24/wsj_2428:For example, a recent $375 million offering of Petrolane Gas Services L.P. bonds sold by First Boston was three times oversubscribed.
24/wsj_2428:A $550 million offering of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. high-yield securities sold last week by Drexel was increased $50 million because of strong demand. 
24/wsj_2428:First Boston estimates that in November and December alone, junk bond investors will receive $4.8 billion of coupon interest payments. "That's a clear indication that there is and will be an undercurrent of basic business going on," says Mr. Carleton of First Boston. 
24/wsj_2428:"I don't know how people can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were $1.5 billion of orders for $550 million of junk bonds sold last week by Turner," says Raymond Minella, co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co. "When the rally comes, insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will.
24/wsj_2428:There is plenty of money available from people who want to buy well-structured deals; it's the stuff that's financed on a shoestring that people are wary of." 
24/wsj_2428:But such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have multiplied this year, casting a pall over much of the junk market.
24/wsj_2428:Michael McNamara, director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services, says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer, contributing to the slide in prices. 
24/wsj_2428:"Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals," he says. "This year, at best, it's in one in every five or six.
24/wsj_2428:And our credit standards haven't changed one iota." However, Mr. McNamara said the slide in junk is creating "one hell of a buying opportunity" for selective buyers. 
24/wsj_2428:For the moment, investors seem more preoccupied with the "bad" junk than the "good" junk. "The market has been weak since" the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York, says Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch. "That really affected the market in that people started to ask 'What else is in trouble? '" 
24/wsj_2428:Well before Campeau, though, there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever.
24/wsj_2428:Despite the relatively strong economy, junk bond prices did nothing except go down, hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news: 
24/wsj_2428:-- In June, two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $1.2 billion of speculative debt securities, New York-based Integrated Resources Inc. said it ran out of borrowed money. 
24/wsj_2428:-- In July, Southmark Corp., the Dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $1.3 billion of junk bonds, voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law. -- By the end of July, the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points. 
24/wsj_2428:-- In August, Resorts International Inc., which sold more than $500 million of junk bonds, suspended interest payments. 
24/wsj_2428:-- In September, just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau, Lomas Financial Corp. defaulted on $145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $1.2 billion of debt securities. 
24/wsj_2428:Meantime, regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of abating.
24/wsj_2428:Moody's says the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest this year since 1982.
24/wsj_2428:In addition, there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
24/wsj_2428:"The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it," says James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, an early critic of the junk bond market. "What we've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest.
24/wsj_2428:What we're seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative-grade debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy." 
24/wsj_2428:Prices of Treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a plummeting stock market. 
24/wsj_2428:Treasurys opened lower, reacting negatively to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in September.
24/wsj_2428:Many bond market participants will be closely eying the action of the Federal Reserve, which might repeat its October 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession. 
24/wsj_2428:Prices of municipals, investment-grade corporates and mortgage-backed bonds also rose, but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts. 
24/wsj_2428:Mortgage securities rose in hectic trading, with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9% coupon securities, the most liquid mortgage issue. 
24/wsj_2428:And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week's $3 billion bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
24/wsj_2428:Despite rumors that the TVA's long-awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets, sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled. 
24/wsj_2428:One of the sources said the smaller portions of $750 million each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been "substantially oversubscribed." 
24/wsj_2429:Friday's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash, and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly.
24/wsj_2429:The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover, and it's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt.
24/wsj_2429:Still, the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business.
24/wsj_2429:This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn: the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut. 
24/wsj_2429:The real value of all shares, after all, is directly impacted by the tax on any profits (all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not "ordinary income").
24/wsj_2429:There is a great deal to be said, to be sure, for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill.
24/wsj_2429:Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens, promises of a cleaner bill are suspect.
24/wsj_2429:To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge, they are another instance of Washington's sticky fingers.
24/wsj_2429:As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course, at some point the market will start to reject them.
24/wsj_2429:But the airlines are scarcely a clear case, given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner, who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes. 
24/wsj_2429:It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to "review" any bid for 15% or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $1 billion or more.
24/wsj_2429:In the 1987 crash, remember, the market was shaken by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal to tax takeovers out of existance.
24/wsj_2429:They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays.
24/wsj_2429:The Big Board's liaison with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved; it will be interesting to learn if "circuit breakers" prove to be a good idea.
24/wsj_2430:First Chicago Corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $23.3 million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans. 
24/wsj_2430:The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago, with $48 billion in assets, said it set aside $200 million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries.
24/wsj_2430:The addition, on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign-loan reserves, brings the reserve to a level equaling 79% of medium-term and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations. 
24/wsj_2430:During the quarter, the company realized a pretax gain of $60.4 million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit. 
24/wsj_2431:Greece's second bout of general elections this year is slated for Nov. 5.
24/wsj_2431:For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece's eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign: The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass. 
24/wsj_2431:In the mid-June round of voting, Greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party.
24/wsj_2431:The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was, in essence, little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation: On one side, the center-right New Democracy Party, headed by Constantine Mitsotakis.
24/wsj_2431:On the other, the so-called Coalition of the Left and Progress -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro-Communist cousin, the Hellenic Left. 
24/wsj_2431:The ostensible goal was a mop-up of government corruption, purportedly at all levels, but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates.
24/wsj_2431:In point of fact, this catharsis was overdue by decades.
24/wsj_2431:With regard to Greece's long-bubbling bank-looting scandal, Mr. Papandreou's principal accuser remains George Koskotas, former owner of the Bank of Crete and self-confessed embezzler, now residing in a jail cell in Salem, Mass., from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece.
24/wsj_2431:Nevertheless, the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity. 
24/wsj_2431:Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $734,000 in bribes, as contended; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $57 million in Mr. Koskotas's bank and then skim off the interest; and, what PASOK's cut was from the $210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched. 
24/wsj_2431:Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court.
24/wsj_2431:But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas Mr. Koskotas funneled into New Democracy coffers.
24/wsj_2431:On another issue, Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency, the EYP, regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures, including key opposition politicians, journalists and PASOK cabinet members.
24/wsj_2431:The central weakness of the "scandals" debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks.
24/wsj_2431:The coalition government tried to show that PASOK ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft, produced by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France's Avions Marcel Dassault, respectively.
24/wsj_2431:Naturally, neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid (or not) to various Greek officials for services rendered. 
24/wsj_2431:First came his predictable fusillade: He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece. 
24/wsj_2431:Next, he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right coalition's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well-respected Communist Party candidate.
24/wsj_2431:For balance, and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes, he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis.
24/wsj_2431:Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench, but also with "seals of approval" from representatives of its harshest accusers. 
24/wsj_2431:Crucial as these elections are for Greece, pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle.
24/wsj_2431:Greece also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation.
24/wsj_2431:Another matter of concern is the extradition of Mohammed Rashid, a Palestinian terrorist who is wanted in the U.S. for the 1982 bombing of a Pan American Airways flight.
24/wsj_2431:The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the Rashid case, but the matter awaits final approval from Greece's next justice minister.
24/wsj_2431:The Greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether Greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism. 
24/wsj_2431:Yet the possibility of another lash-up government is all too real.
24/wsj_2431:Also, he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March. 
24/wsj_2431:New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK, forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles. 
24/wsj_2431:But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who ever raked muck, it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined, but certainly not yet eliminated. 
24/wsj_2432:U.S. OFFICIALS MOVED to head off any repeat of Black Monday today following Friday's plunge in stock prices.
24/wsj_2432:Fed Chairman Greenspan signaled that the central bank was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system to prevent a financial crisis.
24/wsj_2432:Friday's sell-off was triggered by the collapse of UAL's buy-out plan and a big rise in producer prices.
24/wsj_2432:The surge in producer prices in September followed three months of declines, but analysts were divided on whether the 0.9% jump signaled a severe worsening of inflation.
24/wsj_2432:U.S. car and truck sales fell 12.6% in early October, the first sales period of the 1990-model year, dragged down by a sharp decline in GM sales. 
24/wsj_2432:Hooker's U.S. unit received a $409 million bid for most of its real-estate and shopping-center assets from an investor group.
24/wsj_2432:America West said Friday it will postpone its new service out of Houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from Boeing. 
24/wsj_2432:Four ailing S&Ls were sold off by government regulators, but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth. 
24/wsj_2433:The ruling stems from a 1984 suit filed by shareholders of Apple Computer Inc., claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the Lisa computer, introduced in 1983. 
24/wsj_2433:Lawyers specializing in shareholder suits said they are concerned that use of the "press defense" by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling. 
24/wsj_2433:The suit claimed Apple's stock climbed to a high of $63.50 a share on the basis of the company's optimistic forecasts.
24/wsj_2433:But when the company revealed Lisa's poor sales late in 1983, the stock plummeted to a low of $17.37 a share, according to the suit.
24/wsj_2433:Late last month, the appeals court agreed that most of the case should be dismissed.
24/wsj_2433:However, it gave the shareholders the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that pertains to Lisa's disk drive, known as Twiggy.
24/wsj_2433:"The court was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the company's statements," said Patrick Grannon, a Los Angeles lawyer at the firm of Greenfield & Chimicles, which wasn't involved in the case. "The court is saying that the adverse facts have to be transferred to the market with equal intensity and credibility as the statements of corporate insiders." 
24/wsj_2433:Shareholders' attorneys at the New York firm of Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Specthrie & Lerach last week petitioned for a rehearing of the case.
24/wsj_2433:They wrote: "The opinion establishes a new rule of immunity -- that if a wide variety of opinions on a company's business are publicly reported, the company can say anything without fear of securities liability." 
24/wsj_2433:But the jury awarded the USFL only $1 in damages, trebled because of the antitrust claims. 
24/wsj_2433:Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York upheld a $5.5 million award of attorneys fees to the defunct league.
24/wsj_2433:Harvey D. Myerson, of Myerson & Kuhn, then of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey, was the lead trial lawyer, and his new firm pursued the application appeal.
24/wsj_2433:Douglas R. Pappas of Myerson & Kuhn says about $5.3 million of the award goes directly to the USFL to reimburse it for fees already paid.
24/wsj_2433:Myerson & Kuhn will get about $260,000 for the costs of pressing the application. 
24/wsj_2433:Mr. Goldfein, of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in New York, says the ruling is wrong and the fee award is excessive because the USFL lost its major claims, including its contention that the NFL restrained trade through television contracts. 
24/wsj_2433:HOUSTON-CALGARY ALLIANCE: Fulbright & Jaworski of Houston and Fenerty, Robertson, Fraser & Hatch of Calgary, Alberta, are affiliating to help serve their energy-industry clients.
24/wsj_2433:But they will work together on energy-, environmental- and fair-trade-related issues and conduct seminars on topics of mutual interest, said Gibson Gayle Jr. of 585-lawyer Fulbright & Jaworski.
24/wsj_2433:The arrangement, reached after about eight months of negotiations, grew out of 80-lawyer Fenerty Robertson's desire to develop ties with a U.S. firm in light of relaxed trade barriers between the U.S. and Canada, said Francis M. Saville of Fenerty Robertson. 
24/wsj_2433:A spokesman for the company said the verdict is thought to be the first in favor of an asbestos manufacturer where the plaintiff was a school and the asbestos in question was used for fireproofing. 
24/wsj_2433:She will help develop the mass-media practice of the San Francisco-based firm's communications group.
24/wsj_2433:RICHARD P. MAGURNO, formerly Eastern Airlines' top lawyer, joined the New York law firm of Lord Day & Lord, Barrett Smith as a partner.
24/wsj_2433:Mr. Magurno, 45, spent 17 years at the Miami airline unit of Houston-based Texas Air Corp. and was named general counsel in 1984.
24/wsj_2434:Apple Computer Inc. said it will offer cash rebates on several of its machines from Oct. 14 to Dec. 31., as part of a holiday-season sales promotion. 
24/wsj_2434:The rebates, as a percentage of the retail cost of the cpu of each system, amount to 6% to 13%. 
24/wsj_2434:The company is also offering a free trial of its computers to consumers who qualify for its credit cards or leases. 
24/wsj_2435:Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan and Siemens AG of West Germany announced they have completed a 100 million-mark ($52.2 million) joint venture to produce electronics parts. 
24/wsj_2435:In the venture's first fiscal year, Siemens will hold 74.9% of the venture and a Matsushita subsidiary, Matsushita Electronic Components Co., 25.1%. 
24/wsj_2435:The parent companies forecast sales for the venture of around 750 million marks for its first fiscal year, Matsushita said.
24/wsj_2436:Roger Rosenblatt, editor of U.S. News & World Report, resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine. 
24/wsj_2436:Mr. Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and the magazine's editorial offices in Washington. "Frankly, I missed my family," said Mr. Rosenblatt. 
24/wsj_2436:Mr. Zuckerman said his magazine would maintain its editorial format, which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service-oriented, how-to articles. 
24/wsj_2437:Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation S.A. said group profit before taxes and contributions to employee profit-sharing soared 97% to 839 million francs ($129.6 million) in the first half of 1989 from 425 million francs a year earlier. 
24/wsj_2437:The French aircraft group pointed out, however, that financial results from its sector of industry are frequently erratic because of irregular cash flow from large contracts. 
24/wsj_2437:Still, it said it expects sales for all of 1989 to be on the order of 20 billion francs, reflecting anticipated billings for two large contracts in the second half of the year. 
24/wsj_2437:For all of 1988, Dassault had group profit of 428 million francs on revenue of 18.819 billion francs.
24/wsj_2437:The group hasn't yet released earnings figures for the first half of 1989, nor has it made a detailed forecast of its full-year earnings. 
24/wsj_2438:Keystone Consolidated Industries Inc. expects to report earnings before extraordinary tax benefits of about $1.5 million, or about 41 cents a share, for the third quarter, compared with a loss last year, said Glenn R. Simmons, chairman and chief executive officer. 
24/wsj_2438:After a tax benefit of about $780,000, Keystone expects to report net income of $2.3 million, or about 62 cents a share, Mr. Simmons said.
24/wsj_2438:For third quarter last year, Keystone reported a $1 million loss from continuing operations and a $200,000 loss from discontinued operations, for a net loss of $1.2 million. 
24/wsj_2438:Mr. Simmons said the results signal a turnaround for the maker of wire and wire products, which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of lower-priced, imported steel.
24/wsj_2438:As a result, the company hopes to report net income for the year of about $11.6 million, or about $3.10 to $3.15 a share, compared with a net loss of $24.4 million last year, after a loss from discontinued operations of $18.4 million.
24/wsj_2438:For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Keystone expects to report net income of $9.3 milion, or about $2.53 a share, after an extraordinary gain from $3.2 million in tax benefits.
24/wsj_2438:Last year, the company had a net loss of $6.5 million, including a $6.1 million loss from continuing operations and a $400,000 loss from discontinued operations.
24/wsj_2438:Mr. Simmons said Keystone's new mill is expected to produce about 585,000 tons of steel rods this year, up from 413,000 tons in 1988.
24/wsj_2438:Production at the mill has exceeded the ability of Keystone's casting operation to supply it, he said, which will force Keystone to purchase billet, or unfinished steel bars, from outside the company during the fourth quarter and next year. 
24/wsj_2438:Keystone will have to consider expanding its casting operation, at an estimated cost of $8 million to $10 million, within the next 18 to 24 months, Mr. Simmons said. 
24/wsj_2438:Under Robert W. Singer, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, Keystone has expanded its sales force to about 20 people from about 15 and hopes to expand its sales from the middle portion of the country toward the East and West coasts. 
24/wsj_2438:Now I think we have a group of marketing people who are out selling to retailers and wholesalers," Mr. Simmons said. 
24/wsj_2438:Still, he said, the 100-year-old company plans to continue its premium-priced strategy for its distinctive brand of red-tipped wire fencing and other products.
24/wsj_2438:The company claims a 40% share of the U.S. field fence business, a 35% share of poultry netting sales and a 30% share of barbed wire sales. 
24/wsj_2439:Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said a temporary cessation of operations at its Sunshine Bridge uranium-recovery facility in Donaldsonville, La., will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership unit.
24/wsj_2439:The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant, but that the plant can be reactivated quickly when the market improves.
24/wsj_2439:More than 400,000 pounds of uranium a year have been produced at the facility during the past seven years.
24/wsj_2439:A second uranium-recovery plant at Uncle Sam, La., that produces more than 700,000 pounds of uranium annually, will continue to operate. 
24/wsj_2439:Freeport-McMoRan said the shutdown won't affect sales volumes under long-term sales contracts of its Freeport Uranium Recovery Co. unit, but will reduce the amount of product sold on the spot market.
24/wsj_2439:Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners, as owner of the uranium-recovery technology, receives royalty payments. 
24/wsj_2440:A four-page ad from Texas Instruments Inc., running in approximately 140,000 issues of the Oct. 20 "Corporate Elite" issue of the McGraw-Hill Inc. publication, contains a speech synthesizer laminated between two of the pages.
24/wsj_2440:Readers who pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny -- but distinctly human-sounding -- voice announce, "I am the talking chip," as it launches into a 15-second discourse on its own attributes. 
24/wsj_2440:Previous efforts have included musical ads, featuring simple tone-generating chips that play a tune, but the voice synthesizer in this effort is much more sophisticated, with none of the robotic flatness that one hears, for example, when calling telephone directory services. 
24/wsj_2441:It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code Sept. 24 to give it additional time to work on a plan to restructure its $1.45 billion in senior debt. 
24/wsj_2441:It said it chose Lazard in part because of Lazard's offices in Europe and Japan, where investors might be interested in a U.S. leasing company. 
24/wsj_2442:Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it will increase its loan-loss provisions to cover all its loans to lesser developed countries, except Mexico, resulting in an after-tax charge to 1989 earnings of 300 million Canadian dollars (US$255 million). 
24/wsj_2442:"It eliminates the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans," he said. 
24/wsj_2442:Mr. Bowder said the bank will restructure its C$604 million of Mexican debt, of which C$255 million is in Mexican notes secured by U.S. government bonds.
24/wsj_2442:The bank has a 45% reserve against the remaining C$349 million of Mexican debt and expects to swap that for other Mexican notes supported by U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds. 
24/wsj_2442:Mr. Bowder said the bank's experience with LDC debt has been "painful" and this latest move represents the final phase of a program begun seven years ago to reduce its exposure through provisioning, debt sales and debt swaps.
24/wsj_2443:The carnage among takeover stocks Friday doesn't mean the end of mega-mergers but simply marks the start of a less ambitious game, Wall Street's big-time deal makers say. 
24/wsj_2443:"The market is overvalued, not cheap," says Alan Gaines of the New York money-management firm Gaines Berland.
24/wsj_2443:He recently began increasing his cash position to 45% of his portfolio. "I look at where deals can get done," he says, "and they're not getting done" at current prices. 
24/wsj_2443:Lenders are growing increasingly nervous about debt-financed takeovers, investment bankers say. "You had a week of a deteriorating junk-bond market that ran smack into the news on Friday about what appeared to be happening to the bank debt market," says Steven Rattner, a partner and merger specialist with Lazard Freres & Co. 
24/wsj_2443:It was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk bond market, where prices began weakening last month after Campeau hit a cash crunch. 
24/wsj_2443:And banks appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high-risk takeover loans.
24/wsj_2443:The group trying to buy UAL announced Friday that it couldn't arrange the $7.2 billion in bank loans it needs to buy the parent of United Airlines for $300 a share. 
24/wsj_2443:Takeover-stock traders today will be scrambling to learn of any UAL developments, and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in sympathy.
24/wsj_2443:After UAL, the stock viewed as most vulnerable is American Airlines' parent AMR, the target of a $120-a-share takeover proposal from New York real estate developer Donald Trump.
24/wsj_2443:Late Friday night, the London office of Jefferies & Co., a Los Angeles securities firm, traded AMR shares at prices as low as 80.
24/wsj_2443:Over the weeked, however, two developments in other deals indicated that commerical banks and Wall Street firms still are willing to commit billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies. 
24/wsj_2443:For the broader market, the greatest significance of the Vitro-Anchor deal may be that it was put together late Friday night -- after the market rout -- and involves a $155 million temporary "bridge" loan from Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities and a $139 million loan from Security Pacific National Bank. 
24/wsj_2443:Moreover, to complete the entire Anchor Glass purchase and refinance existing debt, Donaldson said it is "highly confident" that it will be able to sell $400 million of junk bonds for Vitro, despite the current disarray in the junk bond market.
24/wsj_2443:In another takeover battle, a spokesman for McCaw Cellular Communications said yesterday that McCaw has been advised by three commercial banks that they remain "highly confident" they can arrange $4.5 billion of bank loans for McCaw's tender offer for about 45% of LIN Broadcasting, "notwithstanding recent events." 
24/wsj_2443:Potential bidders for companies "were saying that things were beginning to look expensive," says Mr. Rattner of Lazard. 
24/wsj_2443:Investment bankers expect most of those bargain hunters to be well-heeled corporations. 
24/wsj_2443:"In the past, corporate buyers were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from LBO firms, which were often prepared to outbid" the corporations, says J. Tomilson Hill, head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
24/wsj_2443:Many takeover stocks plunged Friday, as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the socalled whisper stocks, the targets of rumored deals. 
24/wsj_2443:Columbia Pictures Entertainment, which has agreed to a friendly $27-a-share bid from Sony of Japan, fell only 1/8 to close at 26 5/8. 
24/wsj_2443:Shares of American Medical International, which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buy-out group that includes First Boston Corp. and the Pritzker family of Chicago, fell 15.8% on Friday to close at 20.
24/wsj_2443:The buy-out group is offering $26.50 a share for 63 million American Medical shares, down from its offer in July of $28 a share for 68.8 million shares. 
24/wsj_2443:Hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses.
24/wsj_2443:People familiar with Hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sell-off in Hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing.
24/wsj_2443:However, they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the UAL buy-out group signified a general unwillingness among banks to provide credit for debt-financed takeovers. 
24/wsj_2443:William Lebo, Hilton's general counsel, said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are "on track" for what has been described previously as "a slow and deliberate process." 
24/wsj_2443:For debt-ridden suitors, "the takeover game has been over for some time," says New York money manager Neil Weisman of Chilmark Capital, who has been keeping 85% of his portfolio in cash. "The market is just waking up to that point." 
24/wsj_2444:Of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm, few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease. 
24/wsj_2444:To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment, however, the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms.
24/wsj_2444:Specifically, it must understand how real-estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities. 
24/wsj_2444:Because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth. 
24/wsj_2444:For example, residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76% from the 1979 peak level. 
24/wsj_2444:Building permits, for example, soared a staggering 400% between 1982 and the peak year of 1986. 
24/wsj_2444:Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver, two of the most depressed, overbuilt and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation.
24/wsj_2444:Of course, some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a counter-cyclical play.
24/wsj_2444:The vacancy rate soared more than 20% in nearly every product category, and more than 30% of office space was vacant.
24/wsj_2444:To some observers, the empty office buildings of Houston's "see-through skyline" were indicative of a very troubled economy. 
24/wsj_2444:Its population has continued to increase since 1983, the peak year of the economic cycle.
24/wsj_2444:The rates of increase, however, are less than the rapid growth of the boom years, and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy.
24/wsj_2444:When Denver's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return, and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound. 
24/wsj_2444:Vacancy rates in the 15% to 19% range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20% range in a couple of years.
24/wsj_2444:Under these conditions, even a flattening out of economic growth -- "catching cold" -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia. 
24/wsj_2444:Mr. Leinberger is managing partner of a real-estate advisory firm based in Beverly Hills, Calif. 
24/wsj_2445:Kysor, a maker of heavy-duty truck and commercial refrigeration equipment, said it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels, which are between 30 cents and 50 cents a share. 
24/wsj_2446:Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled, Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, and driving it into insolvency. 
24/wsj_2446:Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause, the self-styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens.
24/wsj_2446:Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona. 
24/wsj_2446:According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting, the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors' federally insured money and was "a ticking time bomb." Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous. 
24/wsj_2446:The cost to taxpayers of Lincoln's collapse has been estimated at as much as $2.5 billion. 
24/wsj_2446:Details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years, mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers.
24/wsj_2446:In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign, Sen. Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, returned $76,000 in contributions after a Detroit newspaper said that Mr. Keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators. 
24/wsj_2446:Sen. DeConcini, after months of fending off intense press criticism, returned $48,000 only last month, shortly after the government formally accused Mr. Keating of defrauding Lincoln. 
24/wsj_2446:But Sen. McCain says Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987, because the senator refused to press the thrift executive's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted. "He became very angry at that, left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp," Sen. McCain recalls. 
24/wsj_2446:In July, California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston, who conceded that soliciting the money was "a pretty stupid thing to do politically." In addition, Sen. Cranston received $47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating, and the California Democratic party received $85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get-out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator's re-election campaign that year. 
24/wsj_2446:Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation, as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright.
24/wsj_2446:Wilson Abney, staff director of the ethics panel, wouldn't comment. 
24/wsj_2446:Sen. Riegle said he would cooperate with any inquiry, but that his conduct had been "entirely proper." Sen. McCain said he had been "deeply concerned" at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper, but decided it was "entirely appropriate" for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent. 
24/wsj_2446:Sen. Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and "I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee." Sen. DeConcini said, "When all is said and done, I expect to be fully exonerated." 
24/wsj_2446:Sen. Cranston, who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating, portrayed his role in 1987 as prodding regulators to act. "Why didn't the Bank Board act sooner?" he said. "That is what Common Cause should ask be investigated." 
24/wsj_2447:Trinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to manufacture 1,000 coal rail cars for Norfolk Southern Corp. Trinity estimated the value of the pact at more than $40 million. 
24/wsj_2447:Trinity said it plans to begin delivery of the rail cars in the first quarter of 1990.
24/wsj_2448:Today, with about 75% of the companies' products being made in China, the chairman of the Hong Kong Toys Council, Dennis Ting, has suggested a new sourcing label: "Made in China by Hong Kong Companies." 
24/wsj_2448:But in the wake of the shootings in Beijing on June 4, the Hong Kong toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on China.
24/wsj_2448:"Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket," says David Yeh, chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd. 
24/wsj_2448:Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China. 
24/wsj_2448:A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong's port, airport, banks and support industries, such as printing companies, have made China's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site. 
24/wsj_2448:"South China is the most competitive source of toys in the world," says Henry Hu, executive director of Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd. 
24/wsj_2448:In 1988, exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19% from 1987, to HK$10.05 billion (US$1.29 billion).
24/wsj_2448:Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern China, where an estimated 120,000 people are employed by the toy industry. "For the next few years, like it or not, China is going to be the main supplier," says Edmund Young, vice president of Perfecta Enterprises Ltd., one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers to move across the border. 
24/wsj_2448:Worries about China came just as Hong Kong's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies, Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc. Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry, causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management.
24/wsj_2448:The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results.
24/wsj_2448:The closest thing the colony's companies have to a U.S. mega-hit this year is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of action figures manufactured by Playmates Holdings Ltd. Introduced in mid-1988, the 15-centimeter-tall plastic turtles are based on an American comic book and television series. 
24/wsj_2448:Paul Kwan, managing director of Playmates, says 10 million Ninja Turtles have been sold, placing the reptilian warriors among the 10 biggest-selling toys in the U.S.
24/wsj_2448:Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season, which accounts for about 60% of U.S. retail toy sales, Mr. Kwan said the Ninja Turtles could make 1989 a record sales year for Playmates. 
24/wsj_2448:Besides the lack of a fast-selling product, they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System, an expensive video game made by Nintendo Co. of Japan.
24/wsj_2448:Many of the toy makers' problems started well before June 4 as a result of overstrained infrastructure and Beijing's austerity programs launched late last year.
24/wsj_2448:Also, concern exists that the harder-line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong, which has been the main laboratory for the open-door policy and economic reforms. 
24/wsj_2448:They say China's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong. "The Chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports," says Mr. Kwan of Playmates. 
24/wsj_2449:The Bush administration, urging the Supreme Court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions, said minors haven't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents. 
24/wsj_2449:The administration's position was outlined in a friend-of-the-court brief filed in one of three abortion cases the Supreme Court will hear argued and will decide this term.
24/wsj_2449:The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion. 
24/wsj_2449:Under that standard, which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices, a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a "reasonable" justification for adopting it.
24/wsj_2449:On the provisions of the Minnesota law, the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation, and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge's permission instead. 
24/wsj_2450:Aluminum Co. of America, hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas, said net income for the third quarter dropped 3.2% to $219 million, or $2.46 a share. 
24/wsj_2450:Much of the earnings decline was led by currency-exchange rate adjustments, which affected the bottom line by $15.3 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with $3.6 million, or four cents a share, the previous year. 
24/wsj_2450:Nevertheless, the company said shipments were up slightly to 679,000 metric tons from 671,000, buffing the impact of the unexpected earning decline. 
24/wsj_2451:For 20 years, federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing parts of the television business.
24/wsj_2451:They hope the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air. 
24/wsj_2451:That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting Co., backed by the deep pockets of parent General Electric Co., had tried to help fund Qintex Australia Ltd. 's now-scuttled $1.5 billion bid for MGM/UA Communications Co. NBC's interest may revive the deal, which MGM/UA killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash. 
24/wsj_2451:And any NBC effort could prompt CBS Inc. and ABC's parent, Capital Cities/ABC Inc., to look for ways of skirting the fin-syn regulations. 
24/wsj_2451:The networks still are "uninhibited in their authority" over what shows get on the air, charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti, the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules.
24/wsj_2451:But Mr. Valenti, who represents the studios, asserts: "The whole production industry, to a man, is on the side of preserving" the rules. 
24/wsj_2451:Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess, urging the studios and the networks, which license rights to air shows made by the studios, to work out their own compromise. 
24/wsj_2451:"I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think of the Sony/Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast exclusively from Tokyo," wrote J.B. Holston, an NBC vice president, in a commentary in last week's issue of Broadcasting magazine.
24/wsj_2451:In his article, Mr. Holston, who was in Europe last week and unavailable, complained that the "archaic restraints" in fin-syn rules have "contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-U.S. enterprises." (He didn't mention that NBC, in the meantime, was hoping to assist Australia's Qintex in buying 
24/wsj_2451:An NBC spokesman counters that Mr. Holston's lament was "entirely consistent" with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be "light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks." 
24/wsj_2451:But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication.
24/wsj_2451:The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim -- for several years at the least. 
24/wsj_2451:The Reagan-era Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules.
24/wsj_2451:Various evidence, including a Brookings Institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s, showed the networks didn't wield undue control over the studios as had been alleged. 
24/wsj_2451:But just eight days before the rules were to die, former President Ronald Reagan, a one-time actor, intervened on behalf of Hollywood.
24/wsj_2451:In Congress, the issue falters: It's about money, not program quality, and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue. 
24/wsj_2452:Recognition Equipment Inc. said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the U.S. Postal Service. 
24/wsj_2452:The suit named the company, former chief executive officer William G. Moore Jr., former vice president Robert W. Reedy and five defendants who weren't part of the company.
24/wsj_2452:The suit charged the defendants with causing Peter E. Voss, an ex-member of the Postal Service board of governors, to accept $23,000 in bribes, kickbacks and gratuities.
24/wsj_2452:In the agreement, Recognition agreed to pay the government $20,000 in return for the release of all claims against the company, Mr. Moore and Mr. Reedy.
24/wsj_2452:A trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began Sept. 27 in federal court for the District of Columbia.
24/wsj_2452:They were indicted last October on charges of fraud, theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win $400 million in Postal Service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment.
24/wsj_2452:The company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension. 
24/wsj_2453:Intel Corp. reported a 50% drop in third-quarter net income, partly because of a one-time charge for discontinued operations. 
24/wsj_2453:The big semiconductor and computer maker, said it had net of $72 million, or 38 cents, down 50% from $142.7 million, or 78 cents a share.
24/wsj_2453:The lower net included a charge of $35 million, equal to 12 cents a share on an after-tax basis, for the cost of abandoning a computer-systems joint venture with Siemens AG of West Germany.
24/wsj_2453:Earning also fell from the year-ago period because of slowing microchip demand.
24/wsj_2453:Intel's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading Friday, as investors appeared relieved that the company's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter's earnings of $99.3 million, or 53 cents a share, and that sales actually exceeded the $747.3 million for the second period.
24/wsj_2453:In August, Intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be "flat to down" from the previous period's because of slowing sales growth of its 80386 microprocessor, start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company's new 80486 chip in the current quarter. 
24/wsj_2453:For the nine-month period, Intel reported net of $268.3 million, or $1.43 a share, down 27% from $367.1 million, or $2.05 a share.
24/wsj_2454:After 26 years in prison, Mr. Sisulu, the 77-year-old former secretary-general of the liberation movement, was dropped off at his house by a prison services' van just as the sun was coming up.
24/wsj_2454:At the same time, six ANC colleagues, five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life imprisonment, were reunited with their families at various places around the country. 
24/wsj_2454:And as the graying men returned to their homes, the ANC, outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government, defiantly returned to the streets of the country's black townships.
24/wsj_2454:At the small four-room home of Elias Motsoaledi, a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, well-wishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in ANC ribbons. 
24/wsj_2454:"I am happy to see the spirit of the people," said Mr. Sisulu, looking dapper in a new gray suit.
24/wsj_2454:As the crowd outside his home shouted "ANC, ANC," the old man shot his fists into the air. "I'm inspired by the mood of the people." 
24/wsj_2454:Under the laws of the land, the ANC remains an illegal organization, and its headquarters are still in Lusaka, Zambia.
24/wsj_2454:But the unconditional release of the seven leaders, who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC, is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing. 
24/wsj_2454:There was certainly no stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night, when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years.
24/wsj_2454:Deafening chants of "ANC" and "Umkhonto we Sizwe" shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts, including the armed struggle.
24/wsj_2454:Without him, said Mr. Sisulu, the freeing of the others "is only a half-measure." 
24/wsj_2454:President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress, a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government. 
24/wsj_2454:As the days go by, the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency.
24/wsj_2454:If it does, the large number of right-wing whites, who oppose any concessions to the black majority, will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands. 
24/wsj_2454:In addition, the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment.
24/wsj_2454:Says Peter Mokaba, president of the South African Youth Congress: "We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC." 
24/wsj_2454:At last night's rally, they called on their followers to be firm, yet disciplined, in their opposition to apartheid. "We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very, very sensitive," said Andrew Mlangeni, another early Umkhonto leader who is now 63. "We want to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison, and if we aren't disciplined we may not see them here with us." 
24/wsj_2455:There's an intense debate in South Korean President Roh Tae Woo's inner circle over his scheduled speech Wednesday to a joint meeting of Congress: Should he give it in English or Korean? 
24/wsj_2455:U.S. politicians and policy-makers would do well to remember such backhome pressures on the South Korean president as they prepare for an important series of meetings with him this week.
24/wsj_2455:When most Americans think about South Korea, they still conjure up images of the war years, popularized by the TV series M*A*S*H.
24/wsj_2455:Moreover, the Korean peninsula remains one of the strategic focal points of East Asia; there are 43,000 U.S. troops stationed there.
24/wsj_2455:South Korea is "critically important to us now, both economically and in terms of security," says Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "Unfortunately, many Americans don't think much about Korea.
24/wsj_2455:But the miracle of their economic growth and the development of democracy -- imperfect though it is -- are very important to the United States." One major topic during Mr. Roh's visit will be human rights.
24/wsj_2455:Just as Pope John Paul II did in Seoul last week, President Bush and members of Congress ought to tell Mr. Roh in no uncertain terms that this kind of behavior is unacceptable. 
24/wsj_2455:Moreover, there is a violent anti-U.S. minority in South Korea -- as demonstrated by the handful of radical students who broke into U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg's residence in Seoul Friday and vandalized it (the ambassador and his wife were unharmed). 
24/wsj_2455:Mr. Roh, a former general and a member of the repressive previous regime, has made impressive strides in supporting democratic values and institutions.
24/wsj_2455:It isn't a perfect democracy, but it's a far cry from the authoritarian rule of only a few years ago. 
24/wsj_2455:Sometimes U.S. politicians forget that North Korea, a country with a population of only 20 million, has an armed force of over one million troops, the sixth largest in the world. 
24/wsj_2455:Whatever winds of change are blowing through much of the communist bloc, they haven't reached Pyongyang.
24/wsj_2455:They enabled the country to avoid being targeted as an unfair trade partner under the tough "Super 301" section of the 1988 U.S. trade act.
24/wsj_2455:Separately, as a result of the revaluation of the won and other measures, the almost $10 billion trade surplus the South Koreans enjoyed with the U.S last year will be cut in half this year. 
24/wsj_2455:Moreover, just a few days ago, the national assembly, with the governing and opposition parties in an unusual alliance, passed a resolution calling for a gradual opening up of South Korean agricultural markets. 
24/wsj_2455:But there's also sometimes a tendency in American political circles to pick especially on South Korea, out of frustration over our inability to do much about Japan.
24/wsj_2455:The U.S. always ought to stand up for its interests, but it's essential that U.S. officials have an appreciation of the politics and history of our allies.
24/wsj_2455:In the upper echelons of the Roh Tae Woo's government, they're still buzzing about Commerce Secretary Mosbacher's trip to South Korea earlier this year.
24/wsj_2456:Most of the earnings growth, however, will come from the long-distance sector.
24/wsj_2456:American Telephone & Telegraph Co. is expected to post a profit increase of about 18% and MCI Communications Corp. 's earnings are expected to surge 58%. 
24/wsj_2456:United Telecommunications Inc. reported last Wednesday that third-quarter net income climbed 75% to $94.6 million, or 90 cents a share, on revenue of $1.93 billion.
24/wsj_2456:United Telecom's Sprint unit posted operating profit of $60 million. 
24/wsj_2456:Growth is predicted to be in the 1% to 2% range for most companies, with Southern New England Telephone and GTE Corp. posting profit increases in the neighborhood of 10%. 
24/wsj_2456:"The long-distance companies have kept their momentum," says Robert Morris III, a telecommunications analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Co., "while the pace of growth for the local telephone companies is slowing." That's especially true for the regional Bell companies. 
24/wsj_2456:Pacific Telesis Group, which is expected to post earnings of about 75 cents a share, obtained regulatory relief from California regulators last week.
24/wsj_2456:In the year-earlier quarter, Pacific Telesis earned $318 million, or 75 cents a share, on revenue of $2.38 billion. 
24/wsj_2456:Analysts expect installations of new telephone lines to grow about 3%.
24/wsj_2456:However, GTE, BellSouth Corp. and Pacific Telesis, which operate in territories with hearty economies, are expected to report new-telephone-line growth in the range of 4% to 5%.
24/wsj_2456:Nynex Corp. 's profits could begin to show signs of weakening from the effects of a nearly three-month strike, while other Bell companies, such as Ameritech and Southwestern Bell Corp., could be hurt in the quarter by one-time charges associated with the settlement of new union contracts. 
24/wsj_2456:Analysts predict Nynex earnings will be about $1.57 a share, compared with $1.72 a share a year earlier, when the company earned $338.9 million on sales of $3.18 billion. 
24/wsj_2456:Rochester Telephone Co., for instance, said it expects third-quarter earnings to be "somewhat lower" than the year-earlier quarter -- even though the company expects to post an extraordinary gain of 50 cents during the period.
24/wsj_2456:For the 1988 third quarter, Rochester Telephone reported a net income of $12.9 million, or $1.10 a share, on revenue of $120.2 million. 
24/wsj_2457:The tug of war between Warner Communications Inc. and Sony Corp. over movie producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters has exploded into a legal battle that could prove an embarrassing setback to Sony's plans to enter the U.S. movie business. 
24/wsj_2457:On Friday, after two weeks of fruitless settlement talks, Warner filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Sony and Guber Peters Entertainment Co., charging Sony with inducing the two producers to breach a five-year contract with Warner.
24/wsj_2457:As previously reported, Sony has agreed to pay $3.4 billion to acquire Columbia and separately has agreed to pay $200 million for Guber Peters Entertainment to obtain the services of its two co-chief executives. 
24/wsj_2457:Sony and Guber Peters promptly countersued, charging Warner with attempting to interfere in Sony's acquisition of the two companies and with falsely asserting that the Guber Peters agreement with Warner prevents them from accepting the senior management posts at Columbia. 
24/wsj_2457:Moreover, they assert, the producers have an oral agreeement with Warner Bros. studio executives that gives them the right to "terminate the producer relationship in the event they were given and chose to accept the opportunity to become senior executives of a motion picture studio," according to their countersuit. 
24/wsj_2457:Warner says in its suit that Sony "has unethically and illegally sought to steal the services of Guber and Peters and injure Warner as a major competitor of Columbia." Moreover, Warner says, Sony enticed the producers with "unprecedented financial rewards to breach their binding contractual commitments to Warner." Warner also names in its suit the two producers, Sony Corp. of America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof, and Walter Yetnikoff, head of Sony's CBS Records unit. 
24/wsj_2457:Warner, which is in the process of being acquired by Time Warner Inc., is attempting to "sabotage" Sony's efforts as part of a "plan and scheme to dominate and control the entertainment business," the countersuit from Sony and Guber Peters adds. 
24/wsj_2457:Schulof and Yetnikoff, of dishonorable dealings.
24/wsj_2457:In its suit, Warner says that Mr. Ross warned Sony's Mr. Schulof on Sept. 26 at a dinner in Washington, "with Guber Peters in mind" that in the U.S. "it is essential that corporations honor written contracts and do not induce breach of contracts by others." Sony went ahead the next day anyway and executed its own five-year agreement with the producers and agreed to buy their company, the suit adds.
24/wsj_2457:Warner's decision to file suit in the wake of its failure to reach a settlement with Sony didn't surprise executives at rival studios, who say Warner is only protecting its own interests.
24/wsj_2457:The outcome of the legal battle, they add, could redefine contractual relationships in Hollywood, where the unwritten rule has often been that contracts were made to be broken. 
24/wsj_2457:In Warner's case, the studio obviously regards the relationship with Guber Peters as a crucial factor in Warner's recent success and a central part of its future plans.
24/wsj_2457:But when Warner signed a new agreement with the two in March, the terms specifically prohibited them from serving as producers or executive producers of movies for any other studio. 
24/wsj_2457:And they appear to be relying heavily on an alleged "oral agreement" the two producers claim to have with Warner that would let them out of their written contract in the event that an actual executive post at another company became available.
24/wsj_2457:Moreover, they say, Warner is trying to cheat them out of "a unique business opportunity" and the fulfilment of their "long-term dream" to run their own studio. 
24/wsj_2457:But entertainment industry executives say that the new contract was signed after Guber Peters efforts to take over MGM failed and that Warner may argue in court that the producers' willingness to sign a new long-term contract signaled the end of their search for a movie studio. 
24/wsj_2457:Mr. Ross and his team at Warner appear to view the move by the two producers to Sony as a personal betrayal after years of support and friendship. "Warner has been nurturing its relationship with Guber and Peters since 1972, long before their recent success," the Warner suit says.
24/wsj_2457:That success, the suit adds, "is due in large measure to the trust and confidence that Warner has reposed in these producers, even in the early years of the relationship when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner." 
24/wsj_2457:Warner, whose executives are the highest paid in the entertainment industry, also charges that Sony induced the two producers to breach their Warner contract by offering them "the most lucrative and expensive package of financial inducements in the film industry," including $2.7 million each in annual salary, deferred compensation of $50 million, as much as 10% of Columbia's cash flow, and as much as 8% of the future appreciation of Columbia's market value.
24/wsj_2457:Guber and Peters say they seek $100 million in damages initially from Warner but may seek a higher amount later after determining the extent of damages. 
24/wsj_2458:Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
24/wsj_2460:Microamerica Inc. said its board authorized the purchase of as many as two million, or 15%, of its common shares outstanding. 
24/wsj_2460:Microamerica, a distributor of personal-computer products, has about 13.5 million shares outstanding. 
24/wsj_2461:Analysts note, however, that the third period is a minor quarter in terms of absolute profits.
24/wsj_2461:Others are cautiously watching the value of the dollar overseas. "From where I sit, the biggest issue for the U.S. agencies is the dollar," said Emma Hill, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co., New York. "For the U.S. companies, the risk is one of disappointment versus better-than-expected because of the dollar." Ad agencies rely heavily on business overseas for their bottom line.
24/wsj_2461:The strength of the dollar will hurt the reporting of foreign earnings, many analysts said. 
24/wsj_2461:For WPP Group, on the other hand, most analysts are looking for margin improvement and good results considering its acquisition earlier this year of Ogilvy Group. 
24/wsj_2462:The involvement of units of two major U.S. banks in separate loans to China has signaled a growing willingness among foreign bankers to resume lending to the Beijing government. 
24/wsj_2462:One of the units, BT Asia Ltd., a subsidiary of Bankers Trust New York Corp., this week arranged the syndication of a $50 million, five-year loan to Shortridge Ltd., which is owned by China International Trust & Investment Corp. (Holdings), or Citic.
24/wsj_2462:The loan will be used for Shortridge's share of the purchase of a satellite, a BT Asia director said. 
24/wsj_2462:The other unit, Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd., a Hong Kong subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Corp., of New York, said it is underwriting a $50 million loan for China's biggest trading company, China Resources (Holdings) Co., for general corporate purposes.
24/wsj_2462:Of the total, $30 million can be swapped into marks. 
24/wsj_2462:Amid the international outcry following the shooting of students and bystanders in Beijing on June 4, foreign-bank lending to China came to a halt. 
24/wsj_2462:Bankers in Hong Kong said this week's Citic loan was an important sign that foreign banks are interested in resuming regular business with China. "It's sort of a benchmark," said a U.S. banker who didn't participate in the loan. 
24/wsj_2462:Russell L. Magarity, senior managing director of Chase Manhattan Asia, said "it is time" to start considering loans to China again.
24/wsj_2462:Mr. Magarity said Chase hopes to assemble an international group of banks in the lending syndicate, including some of U.S. and Japanese banks with which China Resources has had a strong relationship in recent years. "Right now we think we can successfully syndicate this loan because of China Resources' name," he said. 
24/wsj_2462:Indeed, the reputations of China Resources and Citic played a significant role in the decisions.
24/wsj_2462:Beyond the political considerations, banks are concerned about the state of China's economy and about borrowers' ability to make loan payments.
24/wsj_2462:Now that the first major syndication of a Chinese loan has proceeded smoothly, a Japanese banker said it will be easier for foreign banks to consider making loans to China. 
24/wsj_2462:Citic, which acts as a sort of merchant bank for overseas acquisitions by China, is a relatively independent company.
24/wsj_2462:Through Shortridge, it is one of three partners in Asia Satellite Telecommunications Co., which plans to launch a private satellite on a Chinese rocket next year.
24/wsj_2462:The other partners are Cable & Wireless PLC of Britain and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. of Hong Kong.
24/wsj_2462:The loan was syndicated to a group of foreign banks from Europe, Hong Kong and Canada, foreign bankers said; they didn't identify the institutions.
24/wsj_2462:A BT Asia official wouldn't disclose all the terms of the loan but said it was linked to a currency option that allows banks to receive repayment in yen instead of dollars.
24/wsj_2462:He said it was difficult to calculate the exact interest rate because of the currency option. 
24/wsj_2463:Fewer plant managers expect higher new orders and output this quarter than in the year-earlier period, according to the survey, which polls 1,500 managers of manufacturing facilities on conditions in their factories and industries. 
24/wsj_2463:Dun & Bradstreet calculates several optimism indexes, subtracting the percentage of managers expecting a decline from the percentage expecting growth. 
24/wsj_2463:For the next 12 months, each of the indexes for overall demand, production and new orders fell one point from last quarter, to 57, 57 and 59, respectively.
24/wsj_2463:Dun & Bradstreet's data measuring fourth-quarter costs of making a single unit of a product indicated that "manufacturers foresee weaker prices" for materials "while wage pressures, though still present, are not expected to escalate," Mr. Duncan said. 
24/wsj_2464:Bad real estate loans continued to gnaw at third-quarter profits of Southwestern banks, with the notable exception of institutions that cleansed their books with federal bailouts. 
24/wsj_2464:On top, he said, are such dynamos as NCNB Corp. and First City Bancorp of Texas, which acquired big, ailing Texas banks in government-assisted transactions that allowed them to slough off bad loans.
24/wsj_2464:As the only major bank holding company in Texas to survive without a bailout or merger, Cullen/Frost managed only "very modest" earnings in the period, he said. "If the government handed me a big bucket of money I'd look good, too," Mr. Frost added. 
24/wsj_2464:NCNB Corp. 's Texas operation, on the other hand, is expected to report an operating profit "in line with {or} perhaps a bit better" than its results in the first two quarters, Timothy Hartman, vice chairman of the Texas unit, said.
24/wsj_2464:The Texas unit had an operating profit of $58.7 million in the first quarter and $55.7 million in the second quarter. 
24/wsj_2464:NCNB, based in Charlotte, N.C., bought the banking assets of failed First Republic Bank Corp. of Dallas last year in a transaction expected to cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. about $3 billion. (First Republic isn't related to First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco.) Robert Rieke, an analyst with Raucher Pierce Refsnes Inc., Dallas, estimates Houston-based First City's third-quarter net was higher than second quarter earnings of $28.1 million.
24/wsj_2464:However, he estimated that per-share earnings stayed "relatively flat" at about the second quarter's $1.19 a share because the total number of shares outstanding increased. 
24/wsj_2464:More recent Texas bailouts won't have much impact on the third quarter results of the new parent companies, analysts said.
24/wsj_2464:These include the sale of MCorp's failed banks to Banc One Corp., Columbus, Ohio; the sale of National Bancshares Corp. of Texas to Equimark Corp. of Pittsburgh; and the sale of Texas American Bancshares Inc. 's banking assets to Deposit Guaranty Bank of Dallas.
24/wsj_2464:Said Ronald Steinhart, chairman of Deposit Guaranty: "You won't see the newly cleansed bank in operation until approximately Dec. 1." 
24/wsj_2464:Several banks with operations in Arizona, including First Interstate Bancorp. and Security Pacific Corp., both of Los Angeles, have already indicated they see asset-quality problems.
24/wsj_2464:Chase Manhattan Corp., New York, last month took a $126 million charge against earnings related to real estate loans at Chase Bank of Arizona. 
24/wsj_2464:Several credit rating agencies recently downgraded the senior debt of Valley National Corp., warning that the Phoenix-based bank holding company is vulnerable to the deteriorating real estate market. "Despite the special addition to reserves in the second quarter, Valley remains poorly reserved against its real estate exposure," Moody's Investors Service Inc. said in July. 
24/wsj_2464:One of the few bright spots in the region is Colorado, where a mild economic recovery has helped several banks staunch the flow of red ink.
24/wsj_2464:For instance, United Banks of Colorado Inc., the state's largest multibank holding company, resumed a cash dividend earlier this year after recording eight straight quarters of profitability. 
24/wsj_2464:More good news comes from New Mexico, where banks didn't have as much opportunity to get into difficulty in the first place. "The state never grew fast enough to get banking organizations in real trouble and the banking organizations were never big enough to lend into trouble," said Mr. Rieke of Raucher Pierce Refsnes. 
24/wsj_2465:The attacks have intensified since the Colombian government began cracking down on the traffickers in August, trying to prevent their takeover of the country. 
24/wsj_2465:The slaughter in Colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from Latin America, the United States, the Caribbean and Canada attending the 45th general assembly of the Inter-American Press Association in Monterrey, Mexico, this week.
24/wsj_2465:On Tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity, the assassination in Medellin of two employees of El Espectador, Colombia's second-largest newspaper.
24/wsj_2465:El Espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary courage of its publisher and his staff.
24/wsj_2465:A final statement yesterday said: "While some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere, the state of press freedom in the Americas still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship: death by assassination." 
24/wsj_2465:The report charged that Panama's Manuel Noriega is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before. "Noriega has closed every independent newspaper, radio and television station and arrested, tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters," the statement declared. 
24/wsj_2465:It added: "In Cuba, public enemy No. 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere, repression of journalists both Cuban and foreign is worse than ever." And in Nicaragua, promises of press freedom by the Sandinistas "have not materialized." 
24/wsj_2465:Sandinistas Thomas Borge and the Ortega brothers are Castro proteges; he backed their takeover of Nicaragua.
24/wsj_2465:Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. "If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them," he told the Journal's David Asman recently. 
24/wsj_2465:Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized.
24/wsj_2465:President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem.
24/wsj_2465:Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that. 
24/wsj_2466:GREAT AMERICAN COMMUNICATIONS Co., Cincinnati, said it exchanged about $50 million in debentures and notes for 3.65 million of its common shares at $12 a share.
24/wsj_2466:As a result of the transaction, American Financial Corp. 's common holdings in Great American declined to 64% from 71%.
24/wsj_2466:The broadcasting concern said the debt retired consisted of $35 million of 14 3/8% senior subordinated debentures, $14.2 million of 13 1/4% senior notes and $200,000 of 14 1/8% senior notes of a subsidiary.
24/wsj_2467:Robert L. Corcoran Jr., 45 years old, was named managing director and regional manager of Japan and Asia at this firm's Chemical Bank unit.
24/wsj_2467:Mr. Corcoran most recently was head of administration and portfolio management at the Chemical Realty Group division of Chemical Bank. 
24/wsj_2468:Matra Communications S.A., a unit of France's defense and electronics group, Matra S.A., said it expects strong profit growth in both 1989 and 1990. 
24/wsj_2468:The company, which is preparing to sell 10% of its shares on the French stock market, said profit could reach between 100 million francs ($15.4 million) and 110 million francs this year, representing increases of between 30% and 44% from the 1988 level of 76.5 million francs. 
24/wsj_2468:The company plans to raise 1.5 billion francs with its share offer, involving the sale of one million shares.
24/wsj_2468:Between 1% and 2% of the offering has been set aside for the company's employees.
24/wsj_2469:Walker Telecommunications Corp. said it plans to repurchase as many as one million shares from time to time, depending on the state of the market. 
24/wsj_2469:The supplier of electronic key telephone systems has 5.1 million shares outstanding and will purchase the shares in the market, and or in privately negotiated transactions.
24/wsj_2470:The plant, scheduled to operate in early 1992, is part of Du Pont's plan to increase world-wide fluoropolymer capacity 40% by 1992. 
24/wsj_2471:The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 23 increased to a seasonally adjusted 2,204,000, or 2.2% of those covered by unemployment insurance, from 2,156,000 the previous week, when the insured unemployment rate was 2.1%. 
24/wsj_2471:Counting all state and federal benefit programs, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 23 fell to 1,837,800 from 1,839,600 a week earlier.

24/wsj_2472:These days, she would rather exercise, visit friends or read. "If you don't make it reasonably easy for me," she says of shopping, "I'm not going to waste my time." 
24/wsj_2472:Shopping has become such a chore that more people hate browsing in stores than hate doing household work, according to The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of Buying" survey.
24/wsj_2472:Nearly a third of the 2,064 people interviewed by the pollster Peter D. Hart Research Associates said they "do not enjoy at all" window-shopping or browsing.
24/wsj_2472:Yankelovich, Clancy, Shulman, a market research firm in Westport, Conn., warns clients that Americans' love affair with shopping is on the rocks: More than half the women it has surveyed in recent years, and an even larger percentage of men, say shopping for clothes is a hassle. 
24/wsj_2472:Now, on the eve of the 1990s, consumer researchers say that for most people, shopping is simply less fun.
24/wsj_2472:Shopping has become "just one of the activities that we have to do," says Susan Hayward of Yankelovich. "It's not an end in itself anymore." 
24/wsj_2472:In the Journal poll, more than a third of the people interviewed said they probably wouldn't spend a free hour poking around in stores, even if a prime shopping district were nearby. 
24/wsj_2472:But when they go to a store today, they're more likely to think of the trip as a mission rather than an adventure. "They're buyers as opposed to shoppers," says Thomas Rauh, a retail consultant at the accounting firm of Ernst & Young. 
24/wsj_2472:Consumers visit fewer stores per trip (an average of three last year, down from 3.6 in 1982, according to consultant Stillerman Jones & Co.) and spend less time in malls (an average of 68 minutes per trip last year, down from 90 minutes in 1982). "I leave rather than hunt for something," snaps Lisa Max, a 46-year-old real estate broker in New York. 
24/wsj_2472:Despite such negative attitudes, retailers generally say consumers aren't cutting back on what they buy. "If it is dropping off, it would be more likely that they're shopping less often and buying more when they do shop," says Michael Wellman, vice president of marketing at K mart Corp. 
24/wsj_2472:"There's no question our customers' time has become more valuable than ever," says Stephen Watson, chairman and chief executive officer of Dayton Hudson Corp. 's department store unit.
24/wsj_2472:Of course, there are still people for whom shopping is a joy, even a passion.
24/wsj_2472:But some of those people have complaints, too.
24/wsj_2472:Take Cyd Hinman, a mother of two from Norwood, Mass.
24/wsj_2472:The second time, she demanded that she receive the discount anyway, and the clerk gave in. "I'm willing to spend a lot of money," she says, "but not if I feel like I'm getting jerked around." 
24/wsj_2472:Complaints about service are so widespread that six of 10 people in the Journal survey said they have boycotted stores because of the way they were treated.
24/wsj_2472:Service has declined just at a time when consumers are more impatient than ever. "The whole tone of voice is different now in terms of what people expect from a store," says William Ress, whose Columbus, Ohio, management consulting firm has surveyed consumers for more than 20 years. 
24/wsj_2472:Many stores, for example, require customers to walk through a maze of boutiques designed to show off their wares just to find, say, a simple white blouse.
24/wsj_2472:So what should a retailer do? "Those that do the best job of making the shopping experience enjoyable and making the customer feel like a human being are very well rewarded," says Leo J. Shapiro, a market researcher in Chicago. 
24/wsj_2472:Other retailers are trying to mollify miffed shoppers by doing away with their decades-old practice of setting high "regular" prices that can later be cut to "sale" levels.
24/wsj_2472:Last month, R.H. Macy & Co. started promising in ads that shoppers in search of women's coats could "cut through all the confusing sales, special buys and clearances out there" and pay what Macy's says is the "lowest prices . . . every day." 
24/wsj_2472:She recently walked out of a furniture store because the salesman offered to cut the price of a sectional couch three times.
24/wsj_2472:When a store keeps dropping prices, the Farmington, Mich., resident says, "I get suspicious that they're trying to get the most they can out of you." 
24/wsj_2473:The European Community and Switzerland signed a treaty granting reciprocal access to their markets for most kinds of insurance products and services. 
24/wsj_2473:The accord is an example "of the kind of relations the community wishes to develop with its European partners," said Edith Cresson, the French minister for European affairs who presided over a recent EC Council of Ministers meeting. 
24/wsj_2473:As European partners, Mrs. Cresson cited in particular the members of the European Free Trade Association, composed of Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland. 
24/wsj_2474:Chief executive officers in the New York region say they share a national pessimism about the economy, yet are bullish on their own prospects, according to a study of business executives. 
24/wsj_2474:One particularly positive note in the study of chief executives in the tri-state area, commissioned by National Westminster Bancorp, is that as many as 88% of the executives intend to expand their businesses or at least maintain employment levels in 1990.
24/wsj_2474:The survey examined the opinions of 550 randomly selected companies in the New York metropolitan area -- Connecticut, Long Island, New York City, Westchester County and New Jersey -- with annual sales between $5 million and $250 million. 
24/wsj_2474:Executives in the area have grown more pessimistic about the performance of the national economy.
24/wsj_2474:When the study was taken in 1988, 32% of the respondents thought the national economy was worse that year than the year before, while in 1989, that stance was taken by 41% of the executives.
24/wsj_2474:Looking ahead, the majority of area officials expect interest rates to decline and inflation to rise, while 44% of the chief executives feel a recession is likely by the end of 
24/wsj_2474:Only 49% of the executives reported improved company performance this year, down from the 60% in the 1988 study.
24/wsj_2474:Predictably, the year ahead looks brighter; 63% of the executives anticipate better company performance in 1990, while only 10% envision a decline. 
24/wsj_2474:A good sign for the long-term health of the region is that chief executives were generally "quite satisfied" with the region as a business place, saying its benefits consistently outweigh drawbacks.
24/wsj_2474:Highest marks went to the availability of professional business services, which 51% of the executives consider the top benefit.
24/wsj_2474:The local marketplace and availability of professional employees also were ranked high.
24/wsj_2474:Among major drawbacks to the region, 63% consider the level of state taxes at the top of the list, followed by 54% who had the same opinion on local taxes.
24/wsj_2474:Coming in third, 40% said it was the cost of non-professional employees. 
24/wsj_2474:On questions of employment, 40% of the executives increased their work force since last year, and 44% expect to expand next year.
24/wsj_2474:Among all of the executives surveyed who would consider a move, 50% would look at New Jersey, compared with an average 23% who would consider other states in the region.
24/wsj_2474:In one of the highest degrees of loyalty shown in the study, of those New Jersey executives considering a move, 74% would stay within the state.
24/wsj_2474:But one-fourth of the state's executives listed transportation problems as a drawback. 
24/wsj_2474:Chief executives in New York City showed a noticeably high expectation of improved company performance in the next year.
24/wsj_2474:In New York, 75% of the executives predict their companies' performance will improve in 1990, compared with an average of 63% from chief executives from the other locales who feel the same way. 
24/wsj_2474:More companies in Westchester than any other location have increased the number of their employees in the past year.
24/wsj_2474:In 1990, Westchester chief executives lead the way in plans to increase their number of employees.
24/wsj_2474:In Westchester, 51% of the executives anticipate hiring more, while in Long Island that number was 39% and in Connecticut 42%. 
24/wsj_2475:Ronald J. Berens was elected to the new post of senior vice president-U.S. apparel group, effective Nov. 1.
24/wsj_2475:He will be responsible for the apparel operations of the retailer's Holtzman's Little Folk Shop Inc. and Richman Brothers Co. units and the Susie's division of its Kinney Shoe Corp. unit.
24/wsj_2475:Mr. Berens, 50 years old, currently is president and chief executive officer of the Little Folk unit. 
24/wsj_2476:Suzuki Motor Co. 's U.S. sales arm has named Gary Anderson its top U.S. official in the wake of a series of resignations last month. 
24/wsj_2476:Mr. Anderson, who joined American Suzuki Motor Corp. in June 1987, gets the title of marketing director for the company's automotive division.
24/wsj_2476:He inherits "bits of several positions," said a Suzuki spokeswoman, who added that a reorganization last month has eliminated some previous posts. 
24/wsj_2476:Some of these duties had been handled by Mr. Mazza and others by John Dorsey, former director of sales, and Larry Messelt, former national sales manager.
24/wsj_2476:Suzuki sales so far this year, at 24,405 cars and sport utility vehicles, are less than half the level of a year ago, despite the introduction of two additional vehicles, including Suzuki's first U.S. car.
24/wsj_2476:He also served as manager of dealer development. 
24/wsj_2477:Cummins Engine Co. shares dropped yesterday after the company disclosed it will have to correct defects in pistons installed in some of its engines. 
24/wsj_2477:In a terse release, the maker of diesel engines, parts and power systems said it has "identified a problem" with pistons used in its model K and KV diesels since May 1.
24/wsj_2477:Cummins said the problem relates to recent modifications in the design of a piston it buys from an outside supplier.
24/wsj_2477:None of the engines have failed to date, said a spokeswoman, adding that the defect doesn't represent a hazard. 
24/wsj_2477:The company wouldn't identify the supplier, nor would it say how many of the defective engines it has produced.
24/wsj_2477:A spokeswoman noted, however, that such engines represented only 2.5% of the company's overall production in the first six months of the year. 
24/wsj_2477:The company said it will replace all pistons in the affected engines, and as a result, will "supplement K and KV warranty accruals." The spokeswoman declined to say how much money the company will have to spend on the repairs; the company recently halted production of the models until replacement pistons are available Oct. 16. 
24/wsj_2477:The company's shares traded as high as $64 last month, before Cummins disclosed in late September that it expects to report a "substantial" third-quarter loss because of deteriorating demand and other difficulties. 
24/wsj_2478:"This will be the worst quarter since the third quarter of 1987, when steel companies were just on their way up," predicted John Tumazos, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
24/wsj_2478:"We are in the midst of a very severe price drop that will really hit in the fourth quarter," said Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
24/wsj_2478:A rebound in those prices is expected sometime after the winter of 1990. 
24/wsj_2478:After enjoying a 24-month honeymoon of full production, rising prices and lower costs, steelmakers are facing declining volume from disappointing automotive, appliance and even capital goods markets. 
24/wsj_2478:The consensus is that major steelmakers earned between $30 and $35 for each ton of steel shipped, compared with $49 in last year's third quarter.
24/wsj_2478:The Steel Service Center Institute reported in September that 72% of its members believe inventories were "too high," with 65% planning to reduce those levels during the next six months. 
24/wsj_2478:Christopher Plummer, an analyst with WEFA Group, noted that the capital goods market, which had been stronger than automotive and appliance markets, is showing signs of weakness as well.
24/wsj_2478:National Steel Corp., the nation's sixth largest steel company, predicted at the beginning of 1989 that the third quarter would be its best.
24/wsj_2478:However, an initial rejection by steelworkers of a new labor accord sent nervous National Steel customers scrambling for alternative suppliers.
24/wsj_2478:Inland Steel Industries Inc., which recently negotiated an accord that calls for immediate and significant wage increases, is expected to see earnings drop to less than $1 a share from $1.70 a year earlier because of the pact, as well as disappointments in its steel service center operations. 
24/wsj_2478:Many analysts initially raised earnings forecasts for the nation's largest steelmaker as a result of the coming sale of reserves from its Texas Oil & Gas unit.
24/wsj_2478:PaineWebber noted that the world steel export price of cold-rolled steel has dropped to $460 to $480 a metric ton from a high of $560 this spring.
24/wsj_2478:Moreover, the relative strength of the dollar and lower world prices may result in increased sales in the U.S. by foreign producers offering lower prices. 
24/wsj_2478:John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants, also said he believes steel production costs are coming down because of increased efficiencies at major mills. 
24/wsj_2479:I was profoundly moved by the incongruity of modern American life illustrated by your Sept. 20 page-one article "Country Doctor: How a Physician Solved Riddle of Rare Disease in Children of Amish." 
24/wsj_2479:It requires doing the utmost within oneself to alleviate the illness and suffering of others.
24/wsj_2479:Though Holmes Morton fulfills the "requirements" for being a true physician, our so-called sophisticated society and its medical system fail to appreciate the value of such a dedicated physician.
24/wsj_2479:Otherwise, why is there not a rush of funds from medical circles or the related medical-support industry -- i.e. pharmaceutical companies, etc. -- or, most significantly, from all of us to support this doctor and his patients, to support a clinic to further the work of resolving human suffering? 
24/wsj_2479:Having grown up among the Amish in Iowa, I think I can appreciate more than most the difficulty of Dr. Morton's work.
24/wsj_2479:The average person can hardly imagine the suspicion, bred by centuries of isolation and persecution, among the Amish toward outsiders and things modern.
24/wsj_2479:This, in my experience, is particularly true of their attitude toward modern medicine.
24/wsj_2479:Dr. Morton's success is not only a measure of the outstanding quality of his work, but also of the desperation the Amish must feel in the face of this horrendous disease. 
24/wsj_2479:Sadly, the article also contains a profound statement about the current state of academe, the professions in particular and American society in general.
24/wsj_2479:Some experts were quoted as speculating on the detrimental effects of Dr. Morton's work on his career.
24/wsj_2479:University of Texas at San Antonio 
24/wsj_2479:How very refreshing to read about Dr. Morton after all the articles about the Boeskys, Millkens, Icahns, Trumps and such like; about S&L officials and self-seeking officials and legislators, federal and state; about corporate executives whose sole concern is the "bottom line," all of which lead to the conclusion that as a society we have a woeful sense of values and give no thought to what "life is all about." Here is an individual to be greatly admired and respected. 
24/wsj_2480:Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. said it expects to report that third-quarter operating profit fell "substantially" from a year earlier, when the maker of insulation, roofing and plastic materials had profit before extraordinary items of $1.36 a share. 
24/wsj_2480:In the 1988 third quarter, Owens-Corning had profit from continuing operations of $57 million.
24/wsj_2480:A charge of $6 million, or 15 cents a share, related to the purchase of company debt made net $51 million, or $1.21 a share.
24/wsj_2480:The spokesman said sales of reinforced-fiberglass material to the boat-building industry also were weak, largely because of softening in the marine market.
24/wsj_2480:Weakness in the auto industry also is expected to continue through the rest of the year.
24/wsj_2480:Car and truck production was strong earlier this year, but expectations of slower sales in the fourth quarter have cut manufacturers' output forecasts.
24/wsj_2480:Owens-Corning expects to post third-quarter results by the end of next week, the spokesman said. 
24/wsj_2481:Villanova University and the surrounding community have supported the Navy 100% every year since World War II and the university is recognized as unequaled in providing the best of support to the Navy.
24/wsj_2481:Villanova and the U.S. Navy are very proud of their superb relationship over the past 50 years. 
24/wsj_2482:Television is beamed into 74% of the country's villages, up from 49% during the 1984 general-election campaign.
24/wsj_2482:The government hopes to get broadcasts into all of India's 57,500 villages eventually. 
24/wsj_2482:With the elections approaching, critics say the manipulation of such an influential medium poses a threat to India's democratic traditions. 
24/wsj_2482:"In a country with our measure of literacy, television is becoming a serious impediment in the way of free and fair elections," says Lal Krishna Advani, an opposition-party leader and a former minister of information and broadcasting. "It tilts the balance totally in favor of the ruling party." 
24/wsj_2482:But Kamal Kant Tewary, minister for information and broadcasting, says: "We are the elected representatives of the people, and we will do whatever we think is fit and in the interests of the people." 
24/wsj_2482:Many say Mr. Gandhi and Congress (I), with seesawing popularity and an arms scandal that has tarnished the government, stand a chance of losing power.
24/wsj_2482:The arms scandal involves a report by India's comptroller and auditor general, which cited lapses in the government's evaluation and purchase of artillery guns from a Swedish arms company. 
24/wsj_2482:That's a small number for a nation of 800 million people, but a single set might have much of a village for its audience.
24/wsj_2482:A sizable portion of illiterate Indians now rely on television for news they used to hear third or fourth hand, if at all. 
24/wsj_2482:Doordarshan is controlled by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and often takes orders directly from the prime minister's office, some Doordarshan staff members contend. 
24/wsj_2482:In the same month, a group of politicians circulated a photo of a top opposition leader, Ajit Singh, socializing with an alleged drug smuggler.
24/wsj_2482:The next day, a different group of politicians produced a photo of Mr. Gandhi standing next to the same alleged drug smuggler.
24/wsj_2482:But a senior reporter at All India Radio, who declines to be identified, says: "We get orders from a chain of people.
24/wsj_2482:For all the criticism of what is seen as government propaganda, many media experts say it could be counterproductive.
24/wsj_2482:Says Probhat Chandra Chatterji, one of the pioneers of Indian broadcasting and a former director-general of All India Radio and Doordarshan: "It is debatable whether this propaganda will bring votes to the government.
24/wsj_2483:Troubled British defense contractor Ferranti International Signal PLC replaced the head of its scandal-plagued U.S. division. 
24/wsj_2483:Ferranti said Joseph Zilligen, 49 years old, chairman of Ferranti International USA, is "relinquishing" his post.
24/wsj_2483:Succeeding him as chairman of the large, Lancaster, Pa.-based unit, is a longtime Ferranti executive, Albert Dodd.
24/wsj_2483:Mr. Dodd, a 53-year-old Briton, is a Ferranti board member and managing director of Ferranti's instrumentation division. 
24/wsj_2483:The U.S. unit is at the center of what Ferranti has called a "serious fraud" that has rocked the British company for the past month.
24/wsj_2483:An International Signal unit, according to Ferranti, reported on its books #215 million ($332.5 million) of weapons contracts that didn't exist.
24/wsj_2483:Yesterday, a London brokerage firm, Hoare Govett Ltd., confirmed that it purchased on Wednesday 5.7 million Ferranti shares at 56 pence (87 cents) apiece on behalf of British Aerospace.
24/wsj_2483:The purchase boosts the British Aerospace-Thomson stake to 12.98 million shares, or 1.7% of the stock outstanding. 
24/wsj_2483:A Ferranti spokesman declined to comment on whether the management shuffle is related to the financial scandal, but called it generally part of the "integration" of International Signal into Ferranti since the 1988 merger.
24/wsj_2483:He said Mr. Zilligen remains a Ferranti director, but will also be succeeded by Mr. Dodd as chief executive of Ferranti Italia. 
24/wsj_2483:The executive was a colleague since 1980 of International Signal founder James Guerin, who left International Signal and Ferranti last spring. 
24/wsj_2484:Roy S. MacDowell Jr., founder of MacDowell Co., a construction and site-development concern, was named a director of this bank holding company, expanding the board to seven members. 
24/wsj_2485:They say the Fed's draining operations have been necessary to address a seasonal surfeit of reserves, but note that the actions haven't been tough enough to prevent the federal funds rate from easing to about 8 3/4% from its recent level of 9%.
24/wsj_2485:In Tokyo Friday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 143.60 yen, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 144.60 yen. 
24/wsj_2485:Retail sales are expected to have remained flat in September, according to economists, following gains of 0.7% in August and 0.5% in July. 
24/wsj_2485:A long-awaited speech by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson failed to bolster the flagging pound and left many market participants with a decidedly bearish view of sterling. 
24/wsj_2485:Vowing to continue his government's strategy of combating inflation with high interest rates, Mr. Lawson told the Conservative Party conference that the battle to rein in inflation required a strong currency.
24/wsj_2485:The Tories are "not the party of devaluation," he said. 
24/wsj_2485:He also avoided any mention of when London would bring sterling into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, and warned there are "no easy answers" to Britain's economic problems. 
24/wsj_2485:Some market analysts see early entry into the EMS exchange rate mechanism as one of the few alternatives left for stabilizing the pound.
24/wsj_2485:But entry has been opposed by Prime Minister Thatcher, who insists Britain should join from a position of strength. 
24/wsj_2485:Wednesday's discount rate increase in Japan continued to dominate trading in Tokyo, with dealers trying to guess what the Bank of Japan and the Fed will do following the failure of the rate boost to depress the dollar. 
24/wsj_2485:The Bank of Japan entered the market several times in the morning to sell dollars for yen, traders said.
24/wsj_2486:COASTAL Corp. said it completed the public offering of 9.2 million common shares and $200 million of 15-year senior debentures.
24/wsj_2486:The diversified Houston energy concern said combined proceeds of about $580.6 million will be used to retire and refinance outstanding debt.
24/wsj_2487:Gordon A. Paris, 36 years old, was named managing director in charge of a new division, the corporate restructuring group, at this investment banking and brokerage firm.
24/wsj_2488:Tokyo stocks fell sharply as the dollar remained strong despite Wednesday's half-point discount rate increase by the Bank of Japan. 
24/wsj_2488:Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues, which fell 136.28 points Wednesday, closed at 34795.05, down 445.02.
24/wsj_2488:The decline of nearly 1.3% left the index below 35000 for the first time since Sept. 25. 
24/wsj_2488:In the first hour of trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei Index rose 145.96 points to 34941.01. 
24/wsj_2488:The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first section, which lost 13.07 Wednesday, was down 36.89, or 1.4%, to 2623.60. 
24/wsj_2488:The market opened at what proved to be its high and continued to slip toward the end of the day.
24/wsj_2488:Moreover, the current high level of the U.S. stock market, and the possibility of U.S. interest rates being cut or Japanese rates being raised again to keep the dollar down, might draw funds currently invested in Japanese equities into the U.S. market, some investors fear. 
24/wsj_2488:Masami Okuma, senior trader at UBS Phillips & Drew International, said expectations of another increase in the discount rate already are causing some investors not only to stop buying but also to dump some of their recently acquired shares. 
24/wsj_2488:Yoshiaki Mitsuoka, manager of the investment information department at Daiwa Investment Trust & Management Co., said the market had been sustained recently by smaller issues with relatively low price-earnings ratios.
24/wsj_2488:Prices of such shares, he said, now have risen an average of 57% in the past six months, making them less attractive for fresh buying. 
24/wsj_2488:Yukio Itagaki, director of the fund management department at Kokusai Investment Trust Management Co., said the discount rate increase didn't have much effect on the actual market environment, as short-term interest rates already had been above 5%.
24/wsj_2488:And as the rate on newly issued three-month certificates of deposit went up to 6.2% Wednesday, institutions and corporations had little incentive to invest new funds in stocks. 
24/wsj_2488:Some of the blue-chip issues that had gained in the previous couple of days were lower as investors retreated quickly.
24/wsj_2488:Among the few winners was Sharp, which attracted investors because of growing demand for its liquid crystal projectors, traders said.
24/wsj_2488:They also cited markdowns by market-makers seeking to generate some business and a general absence of active selling. 
24/wsj_2488:There was also some speculative energy that helped to support the FT-SE 100 later in the session, when Wall Street showed signs of weakness early in its trading day.
24/wsj_2488:Dealers also pointed to active options dealing in the stock recently and said some of the options had been exercised.
24/wsj_2488:ASDA Group, a U.K. food retailer, closed 4 higher at 163 after holders approved the company's acquisition of 61 stores from Isosceles.
24/wsj_2488:Blue-chip issues attracted institutions looking for defensive positions amid the current doubts about the future of the U.K. economy, dealers said. 
24/wsj_2488:To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
24/wsj_2489:Coca-Cola Co., the first of the group to report, said yesterday that earnings rose 10%, excluding a gain from the sale of a bottled water business.
24/wsj_2489:PepsiCo Inc. and Anheuser-Busch Cos. will report third-quarter earnings gains of at least 9% and 14%, respectively, while results for Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. and Adolph Coors Co. will decline, analysts estimate. 
24/wsj_2489:Because raw material costs have been escalating and because Coke and Pepsi have become bigger owners of bottling businesses, the companies have been raising soda pop prices in recent months. 
24/wsj_2489:Unlike the 4% to 5% growth rate of recent years, the soft-drink industry is expected to report third-quarter volume was, at worst, flat, and at best, up only 3%.
24/wsj_2489:That's a fairly wide range, given the sheer size of the $42 billion soft-drink industry. 
24/wsj_2489:But analysts, and indeed, some of the soda companies, have had difficulty predicting consumer reaction to higher prices.
24/wsj_2489:The volume in the summer selling season suffered, too, from the lack of a critical, yet intangible, element in the softdrink industry: excitement.
24/wsj_2489:Coca-Cola's earnings were stronger primarily because of sharply improved volume from the company's international operations, which account for the bulk of its business.
24/wsj_2489:Volume rose 14%, well ahead of analysts' 10% to 11% projections for the business. 
24/wsj_2489:On the strength of Bud Light, Busch and Michelob Dry, the company's volume in the quarter is estimated to increase about 3% to 4%, while the rest of the industry will be flat, or up slightly.
24/wsj_2489:Coors is expected to achieve greater production efficiencies once it completes its plan, announced last month, to acquire most of the beer-related assets of Stroh Brewery Co. 
24/wsj_2490:My youth in Petrograd, my father -- whom I never saw again after 1924, when I left Russia for the West -- the whole of my early life, it's all been brought back to me by the arrival, out of a clear blue sky, of this exhibition.
24/wsj_2490:The reality to which Ms. Geva refers is the hoard of dance memorabilia currently on view at Eduard Nakhamkin Fine Arts here, under the title, "100 Years of Russian Ballet: 1830-1930." Consisting of roughly 400 items from the Leningrad State Museum of Theater and Music, the show offers tantalizing glimpses of a rich artistic achievement. 
24/wsj_2490:For Ms. Geva, an actress and author who began her career as a dancer during the early days of the Soviet state under her original name of Gevergeyeva, it offers something more: a sense of completion, the lifting of a curtain on the past.
24/wsj_2490:A great deal of what is currently on display in New York belonged to her father.
24/wsj_2490:Of this ambition her father disapproved, because, he said, dancers weren't properly educated. 
24/wsj_2490:In addition to his holdings of theatrical material, he also owned 50,000 books, among them a great cache of bibles, although, in fact, he was an atheist.
24/wsj_2490:That didn't keep him from making a great deal of money manufacturing gold vestments for the Russian Orthodox Church.
24/wsj_2490:After the Revolution, when everything he owned was sequestered by the Bolsheviks, he was put in charge of the state's first Museum of Theater and Music, situated in Ostrovsky Square.
24/wsj_2490:In effect, he became the official curator of his former collection, which grew prodigiously and soon included several thousand costumes. 
24/wsj_2490:While she found out soon after the war that he had perished during the Siege of Leningrad, she didn't know until the curators arrived from the Soviet Union with the contents of this exhibition that he had died of starvation on a sofa in the museum.
24/wsj_2490:Today, the Leningrad State Museum of Theater and Music owns some 400,000 items.
24/wsj_2490:For Americans, the most interesting of the 400 items on display in New York include designs by the German-born Andrei Roller (1805-91) for the Russian productions of important early 19th-century Paris ballets.
24/wsj_2490:No less illuminating are the designs from Petipa's "Sleeping Beauty" (1890), "Nutcracker" (1892) and "Raymonda" (1897), which shed light on the role played by spectacle in the ballets of this great choreographer.
24/wsj_2490:There also is much to be learned from the early stage photographs of Petipa's work, which, though posed, extend our knowledge of its theatrical ambiance. 
24/wsj_2490:Petipa, the fountainhead of balletic classicism, emerges as the show's hero, whether perceived through scenes from his ballets or through glimpses of the dancers whose technique and artistry his choreography played a decisive role in shaping.
24/wsj_2490:Among the most important of the Petipa ballerinas is Mathilde Kchessinska, represented in a series of fascinating photographs.
24/wsj_2490:The mistress of Nicholas II until his engagement to Alexandra of Hesse-Darmstadt, she dominated the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg as much through her dancing as through her connections.
24/wsj_2490:Even Isadora Duncan, the self-professed enemy of ballet, found her enchanting.
24/wsj_2490:The Ballets Russes never appeared in Russia and most of the important artifacts are in the West.
24/wsj_2490:The presence of so much material concerning Feodor Lopukhov, the leading choreographer of the post-Revolutionary Leningrad school, and virtually unknown in this country, is particularly welcome. 
24/wsj_2490:Less welcome is the random nature of the exhibition, which has no point to make beyond the indisputable fact that there are treasures in the Leningrad State Museum of Theater and Music.
24/wsj_2490:While it's an astonishing achievement for the Nakhamkin gallery to have organized the show in only three months, the time has surely come to present this kind of material in ways that reveal a context and a point of view.
24/wsj_2490:In compiling the catalog, the gallery has missed a great opportunity to document a lot of rare material.
24/wsj_2490:The show closes in New York on Oct. 20 and reopens in Saratoga, N.Y., on May 19 at the National Museum of Dance, its co-sponsor. 
24/wsj_2491:Bull, the French-government-owned computer maker, earlier this month agreed to buy the computer business of Zenith Electronics Corp. for as much as $635 million, but denies this is a merger.
24/wsj_2491:Bull says it intends to retain existing management of the U.S. unit and keep the Zenith label, while selling Zenith personal computers -- a product line in which Bull had been lagging -- as part of Bull data-processing systems. 
24/wsj_2491:Merger or not, the Zenith acquisition is a key part of Mr. Lorentz's plan to grow Bull -- the world's 11th biggest computer company last year -- into a profitable member of the top five or six computer makers.
24/wsj_2491:Bull had a first-half net loss of 537 million francs ($82.7 million) on revenue of 14 billion francs ($2.16 billion).
24/wsj_2491:He adds that any full-year loss won't be "anywhere as big" as the first-half loss, which was caused in part by production problems, "which are being solved," at the company's Angers, France, circuit-board plant and a squeeze on profit margins because of growing competition.
24/wsj_2491:Bull posted a profit in 1988 of 303 million francs on revenue of 31.55 billion francs. 
24/wsj_2491:Bull last year increased to 69.4% its controlling interest in Honeywell Bull Inc. Honeywell Inc. retains 15.6%, and NEC Corp. of Japan owns the remaining 15%.
24/wsj_2491:In addition, Bull renamed the U.S. company Bull HN Information Services Inc. Bull HN reports to Mr. Lorentz as chairman of holding company Cie. des Machines Bull.
24/wsj_2491:During the past decade or so, Bull and Honeywell tried various approaches to combining their businesses, none of which really jelled. "We were spending all our energies internally, while externally the world was changing at breakneck speed," Mr. Lorentz says. 
24/wsj_2491:But now, with Bull in firm control, these U.S. operations are key ingredients in Mr. Lorentz's plans to ensure that Bull remains one of the half-dozen or so world-wide, full-range computer companies likely to survive the 1990s.
24/wsj_2491:To do so, Bull is planting itself firmly in the U.S., where, says Mr. Lorentz, a lot of the best people and research are.
24/wsj_2491:The Zenith buy means Bull will derive 22% of its revenue from the U.S. -- up from 18% previously -- and the company spends 30% of its 3.64 billion-franc research and development budget in the U.S. 
24/wsj_2491:We {mainframe makers} live in cycles of four or five years of development and product life.
24/wsj_2491:They {PC makers} get six months of development and maybe 12 months of shelf life.
24/wsj_2491:"Our vocation is to be able to respond to any question our clients ask," says Mr. Lorentz, who joined Bull seven years ago after stints as chief financial officer of a water company and various posts in the French Treasury. "We want to be able to offer complete systems in specialized areas, like banking, ranging from the automated-teller machines to the front-desk workstation to the back-office equipment to the mainframe computer.
24/wsj_2491:Mr. Lorentz succeeded Jacques Stern as chairman of Bull in June, and like his predecessor, he is a crusader for "open software" -- that is standards that will work on the machines of various makers -- in order to give smaller companies like Bull a chance against industry giants.
24/wsj_2491:Mr. Lorentz, Mr. Stern's No. 2 since 1982, inherits the task of making Bull the biggest and healthiest European soup-to-nuts computer company, competing globally with the likes of International Business Machines Corp., Unisys Corp., and a handful of Japanese companies.
24/wsj_2491:Counting only sales of computer equipment, Bull is already the biggest in Europe, ahead of Siemens AG of West Germany and Ing.
24/wsj_2491:C. Olivetti & Co. of Italy, Mr. Lorentz says. 
24/wsj_2491:Mr. Lorentz, an intense, cerebral product of France's elite "Ecole National d'Administration" likes to go rock climbing in his spare time, and used to practice the martial art of aikido.
24/wsj_2491:He allows that the products of all computer makers are getting more and more alike -- "a certain banalization" he calls it -- and that specialized service will make the difference in the future. "How we manage the problem of service will make all the difference between now and 1995," he says.
24/wsj_2491:After having added Zenith PCs to the Bull stable, Mr. Lorentz says, the company will be better armed for battle especially in Europe. "Our biggest asset is that we are well implanted in Europe, and Europe will be the fastest growing market in the world over the next 10 years." But the conquest of Europe will happen, in part, from the U.S. 
24/wsj_2491:"The information industry is global," says Mr. Lorenz, "but the image of that industry is created in the U.S., so we must be present in the U.S. in order to be known everywhere else.
24/wsj_2491:The U.S. represents 45% of the world information market, so it's 45% of our world.
24/wsj_2492:With stock prices hovering near record levels, a number of companies have been announcing stock splits. 
24/wsj_2492:And they can even leave a sticky problem, in the form of higher brokerage commissions. 
24/wsj_2492:In a typical split, a company increases the number of shares it has outstanding, with each stockholder participating on the basis of existing holdings.
24/wsj_2492:The stock's price usually falls to reflect the greater number of shares, assuming no other changes at the company. 
24/wsj_2492:The theory is that a stock selling for $20 or $30 a share will be more affordable to individuals than one selling for more than $100 -- especially for investors who like to buy round lots of 100 shares. 
24/wsj_2492:Take L.A. Gear Inc., a fast-growing designer and marketer of athletic footwear that had a 2-for-1 split last month.
24/wsj_2492:Mr. Horowitz scoffs at the idea that his company's price surge was caused by the split. "If it were that easy to take a stock from 60 to 75, I think a lot of other companies would be doing it," he says.
24/wsj_2492:While a split "does create more demand for the stock," he says, "I just don't think it's that much of a factor." 
24/wsj_2492:While a stock split accompanied by a dividend increase can pack a powerful punch, a split by itself "has no lasting impact on the stock price," says Mr. Cooperman of Goldman Sachs. 
24/wsj_2492:Even if splits did affect stock prices, some academics argue that it would be futile for investors to try to take advantage of them.
24/wsj_2492:"Normally, the investor isn't able to benefit" by buying a company's stock immediately after news of a split, says Frank K. Reilly, a Notre Dame professor of finance and co-author of a 1981 study on splits. "By the time the average investor hears the news, traders already have acted and the stock already has moved." 
24/wsj_2492:That's because brokerage houses often calculate their commission rates using a complex formula based partly on the number of shares being traded. 
24/wsj_2492:For example, a Merrill Lynch official says that firm's commission on 100 shares of a $40 stock would be about $97.
24/wsj_2492:But the commission would jump to about $115 to trade 200 shares of a $20 stock -- even though the dollar amount of the trade would be exactly the same.
24/wsj_2492:Another large firm gave similar figures: The standard commission on 100 shares of a $40 stock would be $91, but the commission would jump to $112.50 to trade 200 shares of a $20 stock. 
24/wsj_2492:Among these is Warren E. Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., whose stock closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $8,700 a share. 
24/wsj_2492:In the lengthy discussion that followed, Mr. Buffett said: "We want {shareholders} who think of themselves as business owners with the intention of staying a long time.
24/wsj_2492:A stock split is "a nice exercise in cosmetics, but that's about all," says James H. Coxon, senior vice president and head of the common-stock division at Cigna Investments Inc. "It's a small net positive because it can improve the marketability of a particular stock.
24/wsj_2492:But it's really of very little significance." 
24/wsj_2492:A split's impact, if any, can depend on the company involved and the price of that company's stock, says John P. Rosenthal, senior partner of Silberberg, Rosenthal & Co.
24/wsj_2492:Look only at the fundamentals of a company, not whether it splits its stock." 
24/wsj_2493:FEDERAL INDUSTRIES Ltd. said it agreed with underwiters led by Scotia-McLeod Inc. to issue 75 million Canadian dollars ($63.8 million) principal amount of 9% convertible subordinated debentures.
24/wsj_2493:Federal Industries said C$54 million of the proceeds will be used to finance its previously reported plan to buy W.H. Smith Canada Ltd., a bookstore chain, and the balance to repay short-term debt. 
24/wsj_2494:As far as I know, there is no way to extinguish such a fire at sea, which is why the U.S. Navy has sensibly built the Burke of steel. 
24/wsj_2494:However, the Navy also claims that its mostly aluminum Aegis-class cruisers, some of which are yet to be built, could never meet the fate of the Sheffield because no enemy missile could penetrate their defenses. 
24/wsj_2495:This is the buzzword Adi Ignatius chooses to characterize in his review of my book "Tiananmen Diary: Thirteen Days in June" (Leisire & Arts, Sept. 8).
24/wsj_2495:I doubt that many readers of this chronicle of the blood and bullets and terror of the Beijing massacre would put it just this way.
24/wsj_2495:Nor mistake, as he seems to have done, a raw, rough-cut, unretouched, genuine diary, complete with blips, print lice and all the confusions of real time with high-gloss footnoted academic scholarship.
24/wsj_2495:Such works will be forthcoming, but I doubt if they will convey the anguish of what Mr. Ignatius calls my "insta-book." 
24/wsj_2496:The Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology company said proceeds will be used to broaden its research and development of products to fight infectious diseases and to increase manufacturing capabilities.
24/wsj_2496:Bear Stearns & Co. handled the closing of the transactions, Repligen said.
24/wsj_2497:Of my whims, 
24/wsj_2498:The thrift said it is waiting for final regulatory approval of the transaction, after which its holders will be entitled to receive $20.83 for each share held. 
24/wsj_2499:A number of major banks have chosen to make huge additions to their loan-loss reserves in the third quarter, either for troubled loans to Latin American nations, soured real-estate loans in this country or bad loans to companies involved in leveraged buy-outs. 
24/wsj_2499:Chase Manhattan Corp. on Wednesday, as expected, reported a net loss for the third quarter of $1.11 billion, or $12.45 a share, following a massive addition to reserves for possible losses on loans primarily to developing countries. 
24/wsj_2499:And several regional banks, including Bank of Boston Corp. and First Bank System Inc., are expected to report losses stemming from major additions to reserves for foundering domestic loans. 
24/wsj_2499:With all this disappointing news, analysts wouldn't be surprised to see other banks, particularly those with loans to developing countries, use the spate of reserve-building by others as an opportunity to clean up their own balance sheets. 
24/wsj_2499:The nation's biggest banking company, Citicorp, isn't expected to follow the lead of Manufacturers, Chase and Morgan with a massive boost in reserves.
24/wsj_2499:The principal reason for the slower growth is the narrowing difference in interest rates on loans and the cost of interest-bearing consumer deposits.
24/wsj_2499:Nonperforming real-estate loans in New England continue to climb, and the number of highly leveraged commercial loans that have gotten into trouble is rising.
24/wsj_2499:Hooker International, Seaman Furniture Co., Lomas Financial Group Inc., Integrated Resources Inc. and Resorts International Inc. are some of the more prominent troubled concerns.
